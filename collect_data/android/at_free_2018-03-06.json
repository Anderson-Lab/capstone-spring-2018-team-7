        "I hope you take the time to read.   This game is amazing, and it just keeps getting better. I do wish you would change the video knives to apples or video. Now I have nothing to spend apples on.  But here is what i really wanted to say i really like this company and the games you put out to your users. I'm newly paralyzed and I been well adapting to my new life and because my hands dont work like they used to these games kept my mind busy and has helped me. I own alot of your games and have spent alot trying to help. I wish I had more to unlock things in time. But Thank you very much.",
        "Ads interrupt gameplay and are extremely aggravating. The video that you have to watch to continue your gameplay never works. The game crashes when xp increases. I personally dislike this game, and it would be better if these issues were resolved. Thank you for taking time out of your day to read this review.",
        "Deleted all my data with no reason. Had a bunch of Legendaries and Rares that have now been deleted. I put a lot of time into this game, and even bought the ad-free package. If you don't want a load of wasted time, don't download this app.  Edit- Updated the app and levelled up a bit. The game crashes every time I get a free revive. Still a massive waste of time.",
        "The game sucks it's alwful. It's gliching non stop for your bad. There are ADS everywhere! Ketchapp you getting worse and worse. There are ads of stupid games everywhere. What a game maker will pay to another game to show them in ADS! That makes the game in the ad even worse. Please ketchapp I was a big fan of you but you made your games so STUPIT. PLEASE FIX YOUR GAMES!",
        "The game was amazing! There was only 1 problem. Sometimes when i  started a game in the middle of it, it would just show an ad and it would make me lose. Unless you fix this my rating will be 4 stars. Fix this and the rate will be 5 stars",
        "I really do like the game. There are two things that get to me however. Knives should all have individual names other than the boss ones. There are also alot of ads, I do understand they need to make üí∞. Otherwise the game is great."

        "I'll get the negative part done 1st. I'd give this 5 stars if there weren't so many ads!!! For the amount of time you actually get a turn, 30 seconds ads in between every turn is a bit much.  Outside of that this is a very fun addictive game.  Note to new players. Although the ball travels better with a perfect hit, there are too many obstacles if you got straight down the middle. Better to hit just left or right of all that.",
        "Needs way more bats i beat this in 3 days and can't get the ball any farther. Add more bats and I'll give 5 stars.  Update: need to make the bats harder to get i already had all the new ones unlocked when i opened the app after the update. Litterally took one swing with the now highest bat and now there is no point to play.  You should make it like 5,000 km for the next update or something.",
        "I think this game is GREAT and pretty fun but there is some things that I don't like about this game for example THERE IS TO MUCH ADS!!!! not just that but also when you do it perfect it goes straight right??? Well hitting perfect actually sucks because if you go to the middle EVERYTHING is in your way I'd rather hit it on the left or right.",
        "Need improvements! First of all, when you will make a perfect hit the chances are 99% that you will hit an obstacle. Secondly, there is no sound.Developers put different sound modes/effects based on the tipe of the bat and some background music! Finally, I think that the game is good and addictive but it needs improvements! üëç‚öæÔ∏èüèè",
        "It's a very simple game, kind of has potential but not a whole lot. There's way too many ads, it feels more like an advertisement trap than a game at times. The ads pop up at inconvenient times and interfere with gameplay. If you have absolutely nothing better to do, then install. If you have literally anything else to do, it's a waste of time",
        "It's fun. But an ad after every attempt is rediculous. I get the developer wants to make money but when you can't play the game without a 30 second ad after every attempt it makes it hard to play. Playing in airplane mode gets rid of the ads and it's fun to play that way. Reduce the number of ads and this game will be better."

It's only happened once to me and I'm on level 41. Now that's saying something. It gives you a super good promise and nope it's gone out the window as soon as you get the game",
        "Although this game is addictive and sometimes fun, it seems the producers of the game are greedily taking advantage of people and getting them to pay money for things not worth it(but they feel the pressure to do so, so they do it). Some things in this game are deliberately set up to make the player fail and become desperate to play on and spend. The Champions League is a poor idea which produces terrible prizes for high ranks, and is just a replay of previous played levels which is a let down.",

And now there is something wrong with my Google Play Store. And no one will help me reinstall it I have asked for help on several occasions through Google but no reply",

        "The scene at the end of the level is annoying and takes 5 seconds to play out. Then you have to wait for it to load back to show your stars getting in your chest and your coins. It would be better if it just proceeded to the next level saving about 30 seconds. All that to say, it's an addicting game.",

It has cute graphics and runs smooth. I just cant get enough. As far as scary no not scary a little like whoa they're gunna hit.. Oh wait phew how did they not hit? RGB keep up the good work with this game and all your other free stuff! You guys make great games for all ages!",
        "Im not normally one for puzzle games but This game is great and addictive, haven't played a game quite like it. This game was done so well from the gameplay to graphics to controls, it is a really fluid experience and a great puzzle game, the new mechanics were introduced perfectly as I progressed and there was never a puzzle too easy or hard the level of difficulty increases and a good rate! Way To Go guys",
        "This is a phenomenal puzzle game. It provides you with an incredibly simple concept that eases the player into the game's mechanics and turns into some very devious puzzles later on. The ads are a bit intrusive, being the ones you could accidentally tap on trying to remove with larger hands (like mine), and unskippable video ads that reward you with in-game currency needed to unlock levels, but those are never necessary, and for less than 2 dollars you can remove them outright. All in all, this is a charming and brain-teasing puzzle game that's well worth your time.",
        "The first levels are okay but after that there's a huge difficulty gap, got really frustrating. Controls are really bad. How I'm supposed to know where I'm taking the truck if my finger is on top of it?",
        "I love this puzzle game to death. I can literally play it all day and never get tired. Thank you for the challenging ones, it gets my brain going and it makes the game more tense. I certainly am inlove with the music. Please put a soundtrack on youtube, I would love to listen to it !! Thank you creators of the game, I enjoy playing it so much, and I do hope that there's more.",
        "I like it! Certain levels were so challenging to beat in Expert Mode I thought it was impossible. But with some patience you can solve it! (With the exception of Houston U-4 how do you beat that in 46 moves lol)"

Getting kinda frustrating and just not worth watch the ads anymore. Can you fix this? If not, I more than likely will delete the app and free up the space.",
        "this game is slightly good but  it is lost its priority to me day by day. initially this game was awesome but now a days it seems to me boring, authority takes this game only for business purpose. after finishing level 30 i lost my patience to this game. it gave more ad. but not increase their game quality. so finally i take decision to uninstall this app to release the space of phone.",
        "Could add more city's it sucks revisiting and not getting new characters.. also the special city boards could have some special effects instead of ... I don't know... looking like a hot dog... what's the point. A hot dog with super speed and stay low would be ideal. Love the game, but to keep playing.. maybe give us something new. The only thing I love is wordy weekends. But only to get the coins back for what I spent on the characters",
        "Sometimes, the game glitches and it's just very annoying when I have the super boots on and I jump on top of the train and then it glitches and the police catch me!  Apart from that very good game but I think the company just needs to improve the graphics...",
        "I can't even play, cause this is a bad day. And this makes it worse, its like seeing a bad nurse. I don't like it, it works for a bit. I don't like trash games, but it is not my fault I am calling it names. Fix it, or people get this bit. This is what I wrote, now write a note. Write a note about my problem, and stop em.",
        "I love this game so much! My favorite thing is the awesome characters, and cool cities they visit. I like how it is a offline game, so you can play it anywhare. I also like the wordy weekend challenges, and the fun events everyday. This is one of my favorite games!"

        "There is just to much to say about this brilliant, creative, and fun game! It keeps me busy while im bored and on a road trip! I saw an ad for this on instagram and decided to download it, and let me tell you I was not disappointed with the outcome. I've been seraching for games like this and I have finally come across such a fantastic game! The Fluffy charectors should be sold as toys because of their adorable look!",
        "I have just one piece of criticism... How is it that you're not selling these things as toys??? I want, like, all of them. For the love of God, make a Kickstarter if you must, but you need to make real Fluffies and sell them right now! The game's great, by the way, although I wish the Fluffy didn't cover the view so much, and I also wish the rainbow system thing was better explained, because I have no idea how it works. Keep it up!",
        "It's interestingly successful. Im actually into the games with a good story or good music. Although this game contains neither Im actually loving it! The only comment that I would say is that I can't see much thing because of the fluffies are big, I usually mix coins or fire and avoid both :D",
        "I love Fluffy Fall so much!! It is SUPER kawaii, fun, fuzzy, and enjoyable. It takes up your time as you try to beat your highscore!! Mine is 45.  I am really hoping that it updates, because I want all the monthly gem stones to be in stone section. I think it would be cool to have my gem stone. And play as it.  Anyways, I really love the game, it is so amazing!! If you love kawaii and fun games, get Fluffy Fall!!! üòäüíï",
        "First of all, I was astonished by the graphics. It's simple to learn, and despite the lack of any instruction, I understood how to play immediately. It could honestly use a little more to do, long run, levels or other goals beyond what's already there, but for the time being it's a lot of fun.",
        "Absolutely Love this! I've only been playing for at least an hour but it's so unbelievably adorable! I always try sticking with adventure games but any game with cute little puffblocks are always gonna be tested as well, I definitely recommend people of all ages to play üòÅ"

        "Good but ¬£4 is a lot to not quite remove all the add. Some pictures are still locked behind and walls. Easy enough to unlock but for the price id expected all add to be removed. Also really would like the pictures to be sortable by category with more fantasy and space stuff in the complex pictures. Also there appears to be no way to sync pictures across devices. If I've paid ¬£4 I should be able to switch between the phone and tablet at will. Both are android.",
        "This game is an entertaining and super relaxing way to spend time. New pictures are added every day, and there is a large selection of different things to color. I really like this app, and think at deserves five stars. To whoever is making the art on this app, it is really beautiful. If you are reading my review, (Wich you probably aren't) I think it would be really cool if you did some pictures from popular books and movies.",
        "In my humble opinion, this game is truly a work of art and talent. This game can be used by people of all skill levels, due to the variations of complexity and difficulty within each pixel art piece. And it's just bursting and overflowing with hundreds, maybe even thousands of art pieces. There are hours of fun and relaxation awaiting you, and what a way it is to pass the time. Even better, it is appropriate for ages of all kind, including small children.Overall, I recommend this to anyone willing, for this is truly glorious.",
        "I love this game! There are so many pictures to color! This game will keep me occupied for hours! I just love how creative they are! But one question...Why do more pictures come by and take the place of my new colored ones? Like, why do more pictures come by everyday? It's kind of frustrating to color the new ones and then more appear the next day. Please fix, or stop the glitch. Overall, great game.‚ò∫",
        "I love this game and both myself n my grandbabies love doing the pics. It would b awsome to have n categories or level of pic. Didn't know about the bomb and other help. I would also suggest to move or when u r doing pic for the back button n save button to hide . I'm always intrupting my pic by hitting the by accident . N also to b able to open the pic at a spot by touches instead of expanding pic. Expecially for more detailed pics. Love it Ty .",
        "Awesome app, its oddly satisfying and can either be really challenging ir really easy. Its constantly update with new pictures to do, and already contains probably hundreds lol, if dont 75+ and in saving the really detailed ones for last. If there even is such a thing. But, i think a counter for how many blocks of each color are left would be a really awesome alteration. There are many strategies to use when you do a color by number. So a counter for how many blocks of the selected number are left, it would be such a life save.this game has taken enough of my life already as is lmao"

Draining my data volume for advertisement is not nice. It's just greedy. This app is producing so much money anyways, why video ads? Wouldn't normal images be enough?  Update: The agressive advertisement is back and it's worse than ever. There are huge amounts of unauthorised browser popups partly midgame and even when the app is simply running in the background. This needs to be addressed!  Earlier: I like this app a lot. The concept behind it is great and it's great fun to play. The questions are mostly balanced aside from the annoyingly football heavy sports category. Lately though the app kept opening up dubious websitest, usually at the beginning of a round. This is absolutely untolerable (!). It should not have the permission to do this. I've been hoping for the latest fee updates to fix this - they didn't.",

        "It's getting frustrating.. I'm into level 14, have up graded skills and equipment but yet still can't manage to get a bronz let alone a silver or gold in the very first jump in the game. Along with finishing a constant 16th about 95% of the time make me think it's rigged. What's up with that??",
        "Fantastic concept and artwork and potentially amazing game ruined by a half arsed tutorial and lack of information, pure laziness.  The fun of the game turns to frustration as you get good distance and terrible scores, but why? You assume landings but the game gives you no information on correct technique. Also same for takeoff and mid air lift.   Come on devs its lazy and ruining a game with huge potential. Uninstalled...",
        "Sometimes it makes no sense. You are coming from quailication as 7th, you jump to 2nd position so surely you cant finish worse than 8th? WRONG. You end up on 16th place which is impossible. There is no in between you either win or you finish 14th or lower. You have 30 pts lead in front of number 2. after 1st round, you slightly fail your 2nd jump, guess what? 18th place for you! If you jump for example 120m on a K90 in Q, you finish first because everyone jumped 20m less, sudennly in 1st round you need 130m to secure your first place because everone managed to jump extra 30m. All in all fun, but still needs a lot.",
        "Took me a little while to get the hang of the controls but it's fun once you do. Could maybe do with some hints to help get the best body position in flight, as this took me a while to figure out. Otherwise, it's a good time sink.",
        "The game is fun but you really can't win the early stages so that you can grind the coins and bc of that you only finish 1st or 16th and that is the thing that makes this game so incredibly bad.",
        "No idea how the take off works, seems to be a perfect sweet spot but no tutorials to help you find it. Deleted"

        "Unless you have 16 hrs a day to put into this game to learn the track you will never have a very high score. Sometimes your vehicle doesnt respond the same as other runs also you may land on your tail and survive and the next time you die its up and down with the control if you keep going or die. And sometimes it tries to flip when you try to take off resulting in a quick death",
        "Would and will give 5 star. But would like to see a gem counter. It gets rather tough keeping count.  Also I noticed sometimes that when come across the areas that have the 4-5 flat spiked walls that you have to time just right. When I die and revive they all seem to sync up together making it impossible to go under. I'll try and screenshot it next time. All in all great job and awesome game. Maybe a custom map feature for future. Possibly added to the no ads fee. Would be worth it then.",
        "This game is my favorite game ever. The graphics are amazing, the controls are great. I can't seem to find anything wrong with this game. Me and my brother love playing it. I also like that it is available on Google Play Store and the Appstore on iPhones. My old phone was an iPhone, and when I got my new phone I was worried that I wouldn't be able to play it, but thanks to Ketchapp and Google Play Store, I can still play it!! Also, I would like to suggest that you add a feature that allows you to create your own level, but it's not something you have to add, it's just something I think would make the game absolutely perfect for me. Then again, you may already have that feature and I haven't seen it/gotten to it yet. Anyway, it's an amazing game, and I hope Ketchapp keeps making amazing games like this!!! (BTW, Ketchapp games are my absolute FAV.) Thank you!! üöòüòäüöò",
        "This game would be great if it wasn't so laggy. Usually I would think it was an issue with phone storage or something, but I am on a new phone (note 8) and have only added a few apps in total. The game was smooth the first day or two but now the speed changes throughout play. The levels become impossible because the clock doesn't slow down even though the movement of the bike does.   Great concept and design. Hopefully that can be figured out if it is an issue on their side.",
        "The game is great fun. I have been playing it for a few months and actually still play it. The only problem i seem to have with it. Is the laggish performance when i am connected to internet. The moment the internet is off then game runs more smoothly other than that. Still enjoy playing it. Though I must say it would be nice if there was a gem counter for each ride so i know how many I have collected. Otherwise great game",
        "Love it. Only thing is there is a glitch when you watch an ad for 200 thingy things you get a menu that lets you get 200 more. Than again, than again. Its better on our side than yours but it would be a good fox so you have to earn them! I love all your games, wish I had all of them but I have limited storage!"

        "Better game than the other similar. I know the other game was first, but they want you to pay hundreds of dollars upfront so you start at similar pace as this one. Or wait long time, and span of that game is years! Whilst this game is fast to start, cheap, and at free play you can beat it in months, while if you spend a couple of bucks, you can beat it in days, at the most weeks. So basically they sell out this genre for a few bucks, and good riddance! It was fun for a few days, spend few bucks to beat it in few more days, or wait a bit. And thats that. It is, how it is suppose to be.",
        "Tap your screen. Wait. Tap some more. Wait. Watch some ads and hope they don't freeze for a minute. More waiting. You're going to delete it eventually, just don't bother.  Reply: If real life were as banal and buggy as this game, I would have drunk a bleach smoothie by now.",

        "EDITED REVIEW(new review first): game itself is pretty cool. There's nice bonus gifts that help get the game moving. Artwork is great. That ad with the voice over didnt do this game justice. Game gets 3 stars, ad gets 1. (ORIGINAL REVIEW) Saw an ad for this and must say it was awkward as heck. The voice over didnt seem like a real person or was too nervous to smoothly say the lines. Left an ill impression of the game at first glance. And while it did get my attention as ads are supposed to do, it's not a positive one.",
        "Good game, but they're some bugs that need sorting out. At random times the game just cuts off, sometimes when you are loading up the game it say ooops something went wrong write an email, Evan some of the videos freeze up or just shuts everything down. I would be happy if I could play the game without any problems at all. Thank you for your time and patients. Have a good day."

        "For all this time I only played girly game like The Sims, Temple Run, etc but I decided to give this game a shot earlier today. GOD how I wish I tried it earlier! This is like the best game I've played in years, it's super playable even for someone like me (who have never played this kind of games before) and I just cant believe just how much this game has to offer! The graphic is flawless, no bugs or errors at all, the control is perfect, and it's superrr realistic. This game reminds me of Hunger Game lol. I feel emotionally exhausted while playing this game because I was always in a state of running and surviving. Very recommended!",
        "Ah perfect game. Fast pace not laggy smooth graphics, and playable on any devices. But i hope i can change my region like asian.. Bcoz most of the player i encounter is mexecan or spanish.. 1 more thing i hope you add a larger map i guess for team battle i think 4km x 4km is enough.. And 30mins of total playing time.. All in all fantastic game.. A two thumbs up for you guys. Keep it up",
        "I could have given five stars. The only problem is the number of players per drop/game. Please change it to 80 to 100 range. Pretty sure youll have a lot of players and ill be glad to recommend it in my facebook page if youll be able to increase the max players. It tends to become boring when you see only 12 players left when the safe zone did not even appear yet. You will look like a rat looking for a cheese around the map. More players means more fun. If you'll take this suggestion seriously, you will thank me later.",
        "I love this game, today i jus download the game, cause my friend ask me tooo download this game and he also said it was fun! So I download it, and he was correct, this game is fun, I just become level 4! Not so soon I will become level 5! Yay for meüòÅ And I already bought the 1500 Diamond suit! It is so expensive!üò≤ but I just want to show  I am not a noob and I like to show at people who dosen't heve it, lolüòÇ and also I loved the game very much, so thank you for making this game and shout out to my friend Imbran! And byeüòÅ",
        "This game is üî•fire. The only reason why I put a this down on the game for relaxing is because it's intense. That's what makes it so fun. Also it's so much lime actual Fortnite. Also can you remove the feature where you die from getting hit by a car it's a pet peeve.  And add more weapons like a rocket launcher like in real Fortnite.  And materials to build with.  Other than that this game is fire.              This game is üåªüåªüåªüåªüåª  .*üåü‚ï¶‚ï¶‚ïî‚ïóüåü*. *,üåü‚ïë‚ïë‚ï†‚ïùüåü,* :*üåü‚ïö‚ïù‚ï©+üåü*: üçÄüçÄüçÄüçÄüçÄ",
        "The best survivor royale esque game you can find on the play store. Takes up immensely less space than others like Rules of Survival. Anyone can play this, no matter the quality of their phone. It's intense solo, duo, and squad gameplay will always have you coming back to take a shot (no pun intended) at another win. An amazing feature is it's voice chat communication system. You can talk to your teammates (though unfortunately, I find most players speak Spanish. You may have more luck.) though i wish there was a text chat as well. It will hopefully come in the next update, bur I would definitely recommend getting this game. My only other suggestion is new maps, a night mode, more weapons, and attachments."

The new customization is very cool üëå but the fact that even the joystick (my usual preference) doesn't make it better at controlling. I don't know whether it is because of my phone or if it is in the app. Nevertheless good job, game is very addictive, keep up the good work üëå",
        "this game is a thousand times better than agar.io in my opinion! It's so much easier to get onto the leader board. Every time I play I get onto the leader board. It's just so addicting and I can't get enough. Everyone in my family loves it too. Creating your own skin is a great option as well. My only complaint is that the 'play online' option is very laggy, and if you fix it would be much appreciated. Thanks for a great game, from sin√©ad, ella, lauren, mollie, shane and ollie üòäüòä",
        "This is better than the browser version for multiple reasons. 1) It doesn't lag as much. I played a few rounds a noticed a little bit of lag, but it's better than the browser version.  2) You can play against AI if you don't want to play against people. I like this because I actually had a chance to win and was able to kill some. 3) You can create your own custom skin, which is awesome. All of this is free as well. I love this version of Slither.io.",

Its a multiplayer game and It's in my opinion that It is probibly #2 best game I've ever played. Great concept and I like to get creative on makeing a snake/worm thing. A+ grade. üëåüëç",

In fact the lag is such an issue however, the game is getting uninstalled. You can't play a reaction based game when the lag has you 6 seconds behind whats going on."

I'm not going to spend another ten dollars to unlock what I already beat so please fix it I wanna keep enjoying this gamr",

        "I have had a very long conversation with someone at the hq and I was talking about the worlds. I bought the worlds on my iPad and downloaded Mario run on this device Android. I ask why my worlds that I purchased on my iPad aren't here. They don't connect that purchase with Nintendo account. When they connect everything else. I told them I am not paying twice so that brings down the rating for me for this game. But great fun and very enjoyable, but get the linking fixed. Seems a bit of a design flaw",
        "This would have got 5 stars had I been able to share it with my 2 kids via family share. I refuse to pay ¬£30 for all 3 of us to have access to all the levels.  Great game though. Fun, quick and easy to play. Many hours spent between us. So many levels too.",

For one I very very much hate how u can not control Mario really u just run forward very very annoying. I'd be OK with this if not for the insane price they ask to move on after the 1st world! Highly disappointed in this. Make it like Mario or get rid of it personally",
        "I'd say it's worth it even as a free game.  It's a fun game to kill time. Even if you run out of tickets there's many ways you can earn more on the free side. To purchase at 10 bucks the play becomes almost non stop. Good buy, good time killer, challenging, and overall enjoyable game, free or paid for.  5 stars from me."

        "With an easy guide, on 'How to play'. Once you get going its great fun. Dare I say quite addictive. Fantastic animations. Amazing back ground music. Plus, no app freezes either.  Its an 'A‚òÜ' from me at least.  Only, what would be a great idea. Is all the piggy bank jewels you build up, should be awarded for your hard efforts. Should not have to buy them back.  Only purchase jewels when desperate.",
        "Ok.....we need an aquarium just for the holiday's.  I cleaned out one aquarium and that's all I have in there is the holidays.  After this session I'll probably save one just for Christmas itself.  Love the unlimited times! Keep the surprises coming!! I don't like so many clocks in one game and the \"timed\" games are insane! It is definitely challenging.  I play several times a day if possible.",
        "Great game. Challenging, fun, and addictive lol. I'm 32 and play this often so it's not just for kids . Give it a try it's very satisfying . Just wished you could add friends ... People that play whom you may not know so we all could help each other. That would make it more interactive and a lot more fun. No one I know plays so it would have to be other fellow fishermen üòâ",
        "If you like üç¨ Crush on Facebook? Then you will like this game even better. The graphics are cute and the üêü give you occasional hints as to what will make them super happy. And then you have that \"Aha\" moment. There it is.  The trap is set. Lol you are not continuing to play because it is addictive. You play in order to collect coins so you can buy stuff to make the little fish happy. üíò the graphics kind of a little like an underwater Farmville with the plants üêü and decorations you can get fort your aquarium. I do play with üé∂ turned off. Cute game so far.        Graphics make it better than Candy Crush.",
        "Fantastic game! It's great fun decorating the aqariums and the game board is very clear. The recent move of the boosters to the right hand side of the screen was a VERY bad decision, as I have accidentally used them when my hand has brushed against them - this has happened many times already. A good addition would be a marker indicating a purchased item.",
        "Because you only get 5 lives and you make some levels with too few moves. It would be nice if you could interact more with your fish and tanks. The whole point of beating levels is to build up your tanks...but you can't do anything with them while waiting for lives. It would be a fantastic game if there was more to do within the tanks!"

        "The makers of this game have put their soul into it, bringing into life every element of the game. The characters are charming and beguiling. I'm in love with princess. üòÅ It's the only game where I've invested real cash, and have received  its full worth. The game is an epic. I love it. Cons: Although I've purchased gems, and bought legendary chests, I've only received relatively less efficient cards like lava hound and graveyard which help in game play only if complemented with other cards. It's a bummer. I think they want me to spend more to enjoy more desirable cards.",
        "NejiOmeGa here!üôè I have got to say this game is a \"quick paste first place!\" type of game and I love it so far been training like a pro to be on top!!üôá I've loved it ever since the updates, oh yes did I mention I'm a returning player?? An exquisite job well done I have so many new opportunities to reveal, but so many opponents to show who's Royals! So all is said I just ask that you watch and battle me tuff clasherzüòÇüòÇ",
        "I don't think I need to 'review' much here. There are some points I definitely don't like about the game. Such as the matchmaking... You get matched with the same deck type in a row. Other than that and some minor flaws it's a great game. I love the competitive aspect about it.  Finally I would suggest some 2v2 with different game modes, such as ramp up 2v2. Also, add the rematch button in 2v2 challenges with random mates.  Hope I hit the 4,3k this season. Good luck to all clashers!",
        "I think Clash Royale is a great game to play and is very well put together for all ages, it is a fast paced game and at the same time can be played with an individual pace of your own to a degree being that there is a clock ticking, also new characters are released at a well balanced rate, so that the game doesn't become boring and the regular balance of the characters strengths and weaknesses are balanced to make the game more competitive. I recommend this game for all ages and abilities. It's great for a few minutes or an hour or so and this game also has several different tournaments you can enjoy yourself or with a friend or a teammate. See you soon on Clash Royale. A.K.A. Dad.",
        "I m lucky enough!!!!!  I just started playing 8 months ago and now I earn 7 legendaries in total and 2 of them are lvl2 where as my friend is playing since more than a year he owes only 6 legendaries and 1 of them is lvl 2..... So plz do something about this we(gamers) expect better from u  Plz don't disappoint them who has low no.s of legendaries....... This is request from all guys who have not got luck in this game I guess...",
        "Supercell, I think your best game is hay day. Clash royale on the other hand isn't one of your better games. Android is better than apple. Why would you ever support apple instead of android. You released Brawl Stars only for apple. You should have less medieval/fantasy games unless you make the knights, princes etc. More realistic. In my opinion I think you're better at making farm and army games. Please make more of thoseüòñ"

Expect to sends literally HUNDREDS of $$$ if you want to be anywhere competitive in this game,  after you spend hundreds the developers change it and you send more to keep the same level with other players.  The developers are greedy and disguise what they call enhancing the game fun is really a way to get more money to play.  Truth.",
        "This game is a fake and useless game. It takes about one and half hour to start the game...pliz guys dont install this game you will regret after installing this game. Most of the people who are giving positve respond to this game are the developer of this game...",
        "I'm not really complaining I'm just saying than the stability never really gets any better, i don't know if it's because you need to spend a ton of in game or if it just never changes. Secondly we should be able to upgrade more than one item at a time especially since we have over 3 hrs on some upgrades",
        "Would be a good game if I could ever connect to a server. I've been trying for several days and everytime I open it it loads for like 6 minutes then says I've been disconnected from the server. Then it says reconnect and never moves on.",
        "Connectivity is poor. I can use internet, play other online apps, etc because I'm on wifi. Cant play sniper arena because signal isnt strong enough though?! Getting old.",
        "Great game, GREEDY designers, better have your credit card ready if you plan on making it anywhere in this game. There's also been so many changes made to it, it's essentially been ruined ."

        "Good game to pass your time. Upgrade costs and parts spawn rates are reasonable if you only use a few vehicles because it will take a long to yo max out everything. I think it will be better if league vs trophies distribution are reworked because its very easy yo reach legends. should give a higher win bonus at higher trophies i think to make it more competitive. And lastly, hackers should be deleted from leaderbord.. there are a few impossible timings on the board.",
        "I enjoy the game greatly. It's slightly different with  the chest and stuff but it is sure nice to get bonuses every now and than. There are new adds though which I'm not super stoked about like the brake time adds but they keep them short and can be skipped quick if you have already watched them. All and all great game",
        "I love this game. Every game I've had, I played for a week or so, and uninstalled. But this one? Ive had for almost 6 months. Been playing every single day. Finally reached legendary 32, I've unlocked everything. I love the VIP subscription and upgrades it gives you. I would like atleast one new vehicle option every month or so. Or at least a new adventure spot. Making a modded version of the rally car would be fantastic. Also, an upgrade on the formula car where it doesn't almost dead stop after it lands from a big air.",
        "Superb game! Too bad, the elements of hate like to hack good things and cause frustrations. For this reason, constantly run constant updates. I wouldn't mind paying through my rather expensive data to diffuse the damage by these bored, small prick nincompoops! Africaüòùüòùüòù",
        "Well done with stealing the boxes idea from clash royale wow you didn't even Change the opening times, I think the next thing you should do is offering legendary and epic chests with legendary and epic cars. I have loved the first part of this game it was funny and doesn't make any pressure on you, the second one should be blocked from play store, shame on you..",
        "If you don't want to give away free stuff from the chests, don't. But stop wasting my damn giving me these \"free\" coins for watching a video only to have the ad freeze %95 of the time. The are plenty of other free games out there, might be time for a change."

If you're trying to complete a challenge, every couple tries it will reset to free play mode and you have to go intentionally kill yourself which sometimes takes way too long. Then if you don't tap the challenge button exactly right, you have to free play again. Then every time you get back into the challenge screen, you have to scroll all the way through every one you've completed. The game would be fun if it wasn't so infuriating.",
        "I paid the 2 odd dollars to remove the ads since i really enjoyed the game. If you are thinking about doing the same DON'T. Paying the money removes ZERO ads. It simply allows you to skip most of them after 5 to 10 seconds rather than watching the whole 20 to 30 second ad. They still pop up just as often and are just as annoying. Personally I would wait for another developer to make a good clone of the game, shouldn't take long it's a simple engine.",
        "Terrible game. I can't pay twice without having to sit through a full 30 second add. I found it faster to exit out the app and go back in to avoid adds. But there are just too many adds that it made it not fun after the first few goes.",
        "WAY TOO MANY ADS! Its so frustrating that after three failures an ad plays for 30 seconds. Also, why are you asking for access to my storage and location and the ability to make and receive calls? As a developer, get with what your customers want. Then I'll consider buying something.",
        "Far too many ads. One here and there is understandable but after every single try, you get an add. Definitely uninstalled for that reason. As far as the game itself, it's really fun and could be addicting but I spent more time trying to get through the ads than I did playing the game.",
        "A friend purchased no ads, but the game still gives him ads, and the purchase was compete through Google, and they can't even give a refund or fix the app to match the purchase. They just stole the money and refuse to give it back. Also, if you're playing with either wifi or data, the game lags more than if you play with both of them off. Fix your support team and game, there's no reason a network connection should lag a game, that means somethings going on with the app, it doesn't happen with other apps..."

        "I think it would be better if you got more gems. You can barely win anything on that little slot machine. I also noticed that you no longer get gems for every day you log in to play. Sure, the money is nice but you can't upgrade with just the money you earn while playing. I spun that slot machine 80 plus spins and barely won anything. Do the gems even pop up as a winning combo? They used to but not anymore.",
        "I like the mobile version better than the PC version because the touch screen works better than the mouse. I also love the food machine you can get for 12 diamonds. It's pricey but we'll worth the purchase. I kinda wish the pace of customers was a little bit slower so I had more time to prepare the food. I do wish however that I didn't need so many gems to upgrade every little thing. Or if I do need gems then maybe they could be easier to get instead of only getting 5 every time you level up. So, decrease the pace of customers and make the gems easier to get",
        "I loved the game but after the first restaurant you need gems to upgrade things regularly and they do not come around often after the first restaurant. All the achievements are money based. Money is easy to come by and I have only won on the casino once and all the fun is lost grinding to make money to spend on the slot machine to try and get gems. I'm on the second restaurant and I'm bored of waiting for gems to upgrade now.",
        "I Love Everything About This Game. I Can Upgrade Everything and Get Far. I Save Soooooo Much Money And I Can Learn Quickly How To Cook & Level Up Very Fast. Before I Switched Over To A New Phone Plan I Realized A Very Awesome Little Technique They Have. If You Have A Connected Account No Matter What Phone You Get Your Levels Will Be Stored & Saved. I Was So Shocked. Overall I Love This Game. Most Definitely Will Recommend.",

Are you still actively developing the game or you called it quits like some other games I had to uninstall because there was nothing left to do in them.  Just curious.....",
        "This game is a bit boring at first since it is really hard to serve your burgers because they take ages to cook.  I, after 1 day,  got totally addicted to it as it gets really fun and especially when it lets you purchase the automatic cooker for just 10 gems it is easy and cool! You will see what I mean when you hopefully download the app as I would definitely recommend it! Thank you for making a fun, addictive app that I enjoy. üòÑ"

Pou has been a constant source of entertainment for over three years!  Love love  love it!  Oh and I almost forgot to tell you that I am 56 years old!!  Lol. It is really that fun to play!",
        "I love this game there are so many games to play within.  One thing I would say is that I wanted to buy shoes before I got to the level I had enough coins but when I clicked it it took my money but didn't give me the shoes so now I have to play loads more when I could have got them five minutes ago. Please fix this and I will rate 5 star",
        "After I posted my recent comment, there were some angry comments pointed out at me. I apologise for that. I mean, this game in great! There are some outfits that are locked and you have to wait too long, and that is why I rated it 4 stars. For someone who says \"too many notifications\", go to the settings and turn off that notifications button. Thank you for those hate critics you guys made. It really teached me a lesson.",

While there are in-app purchases I never feel pressured... I spent a few $ because I wanted to support the game as I've been enjoying it throughly.",
        "This is a great game. I have played it for over 2 years now and it's still my favorite game. Advice to newbies, take your time. Stay in one age and build up your resources before moving on. You can play in multiple worlds, join guilds, make friends and they have great quests to do if you choose to.",
        "It is  great game, for ages 10 and up even 9 is okay. It is cool that we are building a town from scratch, like from the prehistoric time, and building our way up. Not like other game that start you off with big present day buildings. It doesn't cost a lot to do things like building and removing things, some object are free, they give the right amount of money and you can always win some more diamonds. In other games you would have to pay to remove object and buildings are ridiculously expensive.  It is hard to make money in other games and to make diamonds. I personally at night put my hunters too make things that take 8 hours and in the day things that take 5 to 15 minutes but sometimes 1hour. It is a very good game, it is almost as a real life city town, empire.",
        "Very annoying problem with Google Play account disconnections at task swap. Fix this, and I will be able to actually play the game. Since I use my phone for making real income, I need to swap screens to other activities, and each time do a four step log in process back into the game. I have never seen this problem before in any other game, no reason this game would be different. Unfortunatly the problem seem to become worse, I would not spend money on this game, too shaky account control. Will uninstall it now and go shopping for something more reliable. A shame as the game itself is really neat.",
        "This is a wonderful game, great effect and a wonderful story line. My only issue is logging in. I keep getting a message saying my internet connection is not working, yet with no internet connection I would not even get to the sign in page. Please fix this issue or I am done.",
        "Boring!! Hurry up and wait. Never enough coins and forge points. Constantly waiting for buildings to make money and points. Ready made buildings. Can't build your own. Waiting, waiting, waiting. Been playing about 2 hours and already bored to death!"

I have changed my rating to low because you end up spending too much of your own money to get powerful to get your stars to complete the tasks.  They also lose your purchases.  I bought a desk chair yesterday and now it is missing and the task is gone too.  Rip off.",
        "Never thought it would be this addictive! At first i thought \"Oh, its THAT game that always pops up in advertisements.\" but after deciding to give it a try, i am hooked!   I introduced homescapes to my mom as well and downloaded it for her and she finds it adorable and fun as well. We both take time to chill out and have fun with the puzzles occasionally when we are together.   I cant find a single flaw or critique for this game, its amazing :)",
        "Veeery enjoyable game! I feel like it's advertised too much, but it's definitely worth playing. Especially if you love games like Bejeweled!  Some of the levels are unnecessarily difficult to get by. You have to either get lucky, or be some type of strategic genius to pass them within a good time frame. That's slightly disappounting. Its too much of an encouragement to use money.",
        "Homescapes is an awesome game, combining the relaxation (and frustration!) of match 3 games with the joy of renovating a fabulous mansion. Throw in the fascinating story line, lovable characters lovely music and stunning graphics (except the kitchen wallpaper lol), I'll be playing this for a long time! I'm working on the living room right now, getting close to level 600. Can't wait to see what the new character, Jerry, has in store for us! Thank you Playrix!",
        "I really like this Game so Far. I will play for awhile to See how it Works & If I like it. Absolutely Love Your Game. Play it ALL THE TIME!!! I Must Admit that I Really Do enjoy this Game! Sometimes I find myself Having a Hard Time With Certain Levels. I Could be On that Level for Days or a Few Weeks. I think with Some Improvement that Would make People Play. This Game More. But I Must Say Hat's Off to The Developers",
        "Love the concept.  Even like the mini games, graphics, characters. Played to level 120.. But not worth the cost to play.  900 coins to get an extra 5 moves to win only 60 coins back? 1200 if you want 5 more? Some levels are great some are way too difficult.. Even when it says hard level.. game is not worth sticking around as a favorite to play"

Graphics aren't good at all but you have got recoil and swaying scope that I noticed as well. All in all, pretty good game. Maybe add a toggle to gold your breathe in the future so that it doesn't sway?",
        "This is a great game but the bottom line is the developers want you to spend money upgrading. You get along so far upgrading with coins, which can be earned. Then they want tokens, which you must buy, to go further. The deals on weapons that are offered are always just out of reach. You can earn diamonds watching videos but I would rather play a game than waste time watching stupid add so I can play a game. It was fun but no more. Deleting.",

        "It is far too difficult to advance in this game without spending money. The developers get money from ads, and I'm willing to watch them, but not for 1 diamond every 30 seconds, when the smallest upgrade in weapons is 360. They must not want people to keep playing an otherwise good game.",
        "This is the most grindy game I have ever played. To get anywhere close to a smooth play through, you have to spend obscene amounts of money. It'd be just as much money to buy a PlayStation 3 and fallout 3, and you'd have better graphics, better shooting, and shorter load times. Plus, every level and every gun has to be downloaded separately. It's over 200 mb for me, and I only played for a day and got to level 2!",

Even if you are stupid enough to pour money into this garbage, you will get your butt handed to you by someone else.",
        "This is for the makers of this game you need to introduce rules so that players who either work for the makers or spend 100's to become strong very quickly... cannot destroy the enjoyment of the game for those of us who would like to grow in the game and play the game properly to become strong through perseverance and hard work... the cash rich players are ruining this game for everyone...",
        "Has alot to keep you busy. For that i give 5 stars. Minus 1 star because certain features in the game cannot be unlocked unless you spend money. To me thats a recipe for a slow death. For i will soon be leaving guns of glory in a blaze of glory based on that alone.",
        "I love the game, it's great and always looking forward to playing it, and lately it's been freezing and exiting me out of the game every couple of minutes. So it's kind of hard to enjoy this great game. Also I don't know if there's a way to develope another estate but I think that would be beneficial to the game and pretty cool.",
        "You guys really need to do some balancing. It's ridiculous that a level 22 guy can just annihilate me when I'm level 10. Its pretty blatant that you're trying to force us to pay to play. You should make it to where you can only attack X levels below you and the further down you go, the less loot/xp you get, if you attack even or higher you get bonus loot/xp. Good game but needs rebalancing asap or your game will slowly die.",
        "This a pay to win game with lootboxes of different packs. They will keep making you spend with micro transaction of useless stuff to get the real thing you seek. Once, they took my money and the item was not delivered to me because i asked refund before, for a pack called \"hope gemstones pack\" but after 3 times of 20 bucks purchases, i did not get a single hope gemstone. A scam game in a very good way to steal your money. On the other hand, the game is very addictive and well made. If only the developer has a bit of decency.."

The game can sometimes make you rage a little, and the colors can be little bit to neon and flashy for you. The whole point that I think about this game is that it tries to make it very challenging. The colors are beautiful in my opinion. The ads can me sometimes annoying, but you can turn on the airplane more so that they won't annoy you too much. Keep up the great work, RobTobGames!   C√∏okie",
        "Its a legit fun game to play but...  For me I get streshed because when I need to do it over again then u  streshed by not doing it...    Its still kind of a good game though..

        "Addictive & Fun I think GD Lite is super awesome and addictive. I think it's fun because it's challenging and there's super fun things in GD except hacking because that's no fun. Anyways GD is addictive because everyone gets it they beat a level get super happy and boom there into the game. And I'm super happy because I beat every single level in GD Lite! I hope there could be even more levels!                                                        Challenging levels in GD I think Clutterfunk is the hardest even though I did beat it :D! But the most toghest is       Clubstep, Theary of Everything 2, and the one and only Deadlocked the three demons in GD! GD is awesome!!!!! :D :D :D &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 I love you GD!!!!!! üòéüòÇ",
        "Well, I admit, I'm addicted to this. The levels are SO FUN, and also quite challenging. Sometimes,yes, I rage, but it wouldn't be fun if it was too easy.The animation is sophisticated, the music is AMAZING (my two favorite songs are Clutterfunk and Can't Let Go) and they give you a TON of levels for a free trial. I LOVE THIS GAME!!!! Thank you Robtop!!! üôåüòéüòç",
        "It's a real cool game, I do recommend playing this game because not is it only fun bit addictive as well. There are loads of levels so you never get Bored but warning ‚ö† the levels do get harder as u go further on. But yeah I do recommend playing this game it's super fun, super addictive and i would rate it a 4 star.",
        "So rage inducing! But i am a comete noob at your amazing creations. When o first downloaded it 3 yrs ago i hated it a deleyed after failing the first level before getting halfway. Some how though my abillity for rage cam control itself and yea. So in a way you made a rage game that helped my rage. Huh. Anyways great game might buy full version. Only if i can become a good player though"

I don't know why this is happening but it sucks because it's putting me off the game.. it's like 8 ball is making sure I'm losing hence the rate 3",

I was just about to win when i hit my solid ball and then last black ball was left but the ball goes in opponents hand said that you didn't hit your ball.. what was that? Can you please stop all these hacks and all for other users. There is no fair gameplay between each other.. please do some favourable to all users.  Hope you will take quick action in this manner Thanks.. Apoorv",

        "I realize y'all gotta get paid but why make the playing experience for those of us that don't pay cash money.  Not allowing a player to select a pocket when shooting the 8 ball and allowing your opponent to shoot and win. I guess I'm pretty good because nobody has been able to get rid of me playing pool. Instead I seem to get strange lock ups or no response from game. I always seem to lose 100s of thousands. It's a pretty good app and I've sent many people to download your app.",
        "This is the most addictive game i have playing since a bought this phone. All the new updates are cool. Need to get rid of those hackers playin along. Also when we get a phonecall the game reopens, its better if you  reconnect it during the tier its self .. very plesent game give lots of happiness.. make sure you work with above mentioned glitches, then 5* is sure."

        "The game is good, but the multiplayer needs to be fixed.  It hangs on load and results in the player losing money or gems with no recourse.  It randomly drops ships, and when one player immediatlely gets the best ship and the other player doesn't receive any ship until 10 rounds later, it is impossible to catch up.  Fix the multiplayer, then you get your 5 stars.",
        "I was trying to take advantage of the first time deal. I purchased a deal and for some reason Google play didn't allow me to  complete the charge. The next day I look in my bank account and I have been charged for what Google play said I couldn't do and I was charged another $4 when I didn't even click on anything. I want my money back. That is real shady that you would charge someone for a service that didn't even go through. And where did a $4 charge come from. And there is no way to ask through support to get that back so I'm taking this here where others can see. Don't spend money here or there will be random charged in your bank account.  Update: I do not want a thank you, i want my money back. There's no way to contact the developers except through Google play which already seems shady.",
        "Definitely not worth it. Was fun at first, but after the updated quests, the game took a serious nosedive in quality. Now you HAVE to beat the opponent in order to get anything, otherwise you're out 1000 gold. Before, you would get something just for playing. The new PvP just sucks.",
        "Generic shmup not worth the time not even a bullet hell. So many adds and inapp purchase forced unless you spend hours on end. If you want a amazing shmup go for Tyrain. Much better and has difficulties ranging from dirt easy to near impossible with speed change optional. Tyrain provides a wide range for all players.",
        "I got a new phone and I installed this game on it and it put me on level 5. I was on level 32. I had 56 stars and my combat power was on 72000. If it don't update the game with my current data I don't think I am going to play it anymore. I don't want to star all over again.",
        "Pretty decent game, shame you need to pay gems for the second last ship. The PvP is fun but half the time reduces my gold when I win. Cannot see the devs replying to any messages so unsure if they care"

Could you please add the opinion to change the cash to English pounds (¬£) and the chance to open more lockers and better chances on getting rare items. And tell us which cities we could find certain items we need to have in storage to complete missions.",

And the rest of the screen shows the normal background for mutt's semi legal store, and I pretty much can't do anything when this happens. I have to reset the game, and each time I try to \"show results\" in mutt's semi legal store, same thing happens. Please fix this",
        "Really liked the game at first, but I'm encountering a glitch early on that's making it unplayable. When I try to tap on the one of the first buildings you unlock, it tells me it's still downloading but is stuck at 0%. I've tried restarting the app, restarting my phone, reinstalling the app, but the problem persists. If this was resolved I'd definitely give it a better rating.",
        "What is wrong with the newest update? I can't acquire my item from the switch shop. Every time I click on get item, the black screen goes to the top left of the screen. And I can see the normal background picture. When that happens I have to close the game and reset. I've tried to get the item 20 times and it does that every time.",
        "Was a great game til the update. Now I have to open it twice for my energy to update and for the money in the pawn shop to change. Also when I bargain with clients now it's alway a negative profit compared to before. More annoying then anything",
        "My main issue with this game is the fact that a mission is requiring me to renovate a building but in order to do that I need to download an additional package which WILL NOT download. Rendering the mission unattainable and the game broken by default. Would this issue be resolved then there would be no need for such a low star rating and I would gladly rate it better."

        "Its a great competitive game with similar and different stuff compared to PUBG, and even does some things a bit better. But please nerf the vehicles hitbox radius and how many people can get into a car all at once. I've been killed 6 times now by someone or some people using only a vehicle and running other people over. Nerf the vehicles and I'll rate 5 star.",
        "No complaints about the game, i liked it. It's just that i lost my account today and i dont know what's the cause. last time i played it i closed the game when i finished a match by pressing the home button and left it there for a few hours. when i open the game again my account was lost. i forgot to bind my account to any social media because i thought i already binded it by sharing to facebook. is there any way you guys can help me ?",
        "This game is cool adictive best controls and cool cars, jeeps and also gliders.. but one thing to say: Update needed Every sunday they can get epic paints for guns and clothes,pants or in daily missions thats all. Oh wait how to use spray button to paint vechile job?",
        "The game really ok. I love the feature where you can talk to your team online. However, since I've updated my ROS, it became super loggy and now I can't even open it to play. I tried to re-install the game but still, it won't open anymore. What happen? Please fix it immediately.",
        "I have crashed a ridiculous amount of times in the new update. And guess what? If it doesn't crash, it lags so bad that it makes it impossible to play. Its a good game when it works, which isn't very often for me. And now when I was riding in a three wheeler and a enemy started driving and I crashed, then when I got back I was out of the three wheeler and in the middle of a fire fight and died",
        "I love the game over all. There is one thing that ticks me off the cars. people get them then chase u and knock u down. Once u r knocked down they get out of the car and kill u. IT'S RIDICULOUS. The fact that you cant shoot through the fences makes it so others can use them as coves while u move to them and get killed"

How long do you have to stalk someone's village before you actually get a chance to take your revenge?  Also, it would be great if you could assign multiple builders to one upgrade or build to shorten the time it takes to upgrade.",

        "I think it's a good game but sometimes the ball would go in but then it bounces out you should also add modes, one like there are walls all around and I like the game keep making these addictive games:D also all you guys stop with the adds just turn off your WiFi let them have some money after hard work on many game's like would you want to make a game and not get money and just get  ALL YOUR COMMENTS WITH ADDS! ohhh that would be soo annoying.",
        "Ya hate ads? Turn off wifi and play. Stupid phone/gaming noobs. Its a good game and dont hate on it for ads. The ads make the people who made the game MONEY. Give then a break. Let them have money while u watch something u might want. If u wanna turn it off, like i said, turn off wifi.",
        "I love the game it is so simple yet super fun. Just the only down side is that there are WAY to many ads. I stared playing a round and then an ad pops up.. Like really. At least put a 15 second ad up after the round is finished where you can choose to wat h and ad to continue after you have missed and your time is up. If that person skips the chance then put up and ad. Or just remove them. Thank you dev for the lovely game though ¬∂:",
        "Don't get me wrong this app is addicting and fun. The thing that ruins this app is ads. For a game were it is meant to be played in quick bursts and you aren't meant to succeed for long periods of time, i don't understand how you can put an ad after every attempt. Sure one per 3 to 5 games and the another 30 second ad, but at the rate they come this game isn't fun anymore. The craziest thing to me is that i can't find a way to invest a few cents into the app to perma-block the ads. Come on dev i know you can do better than this. I will adjust the rating when i am offered a solution. Until then this 4 to 5 star app has 1 to 2 star potential.",
        "It would be 5 stars if for one, the ball didn't just disappear more or less everytime it goes of the screen. And two, if the ball actually moved when i tap the screen rather than decide to just lay on the ground like a dead badger. As for reason three, there are waaaay to many ads. It asks me if i want to watch an ad to continue so then i press no and it still makes me watch an ad, that's just cheap. I understand they have to make money but this is a whole different story here. But  when it does decide to work and when i turn my wifi off, its pretty fun.",
        "Would pay for the game to remove ads. I get you can turn off WiFi/data but it shouldn't be necessary, and is unfair to the company itself. Please offer a paid ad-free version!"

        "I used to play this game a couple years ago, and at the time, it had satisfying gameplay and great time killing qualities. I used to love it then and I still do now, but I've recently noticed pretty annoying glitch that's driving me away from the game. For some reason, a few hours after I download the game, it doesn't allow me to enter the game anymore. When I open the game,  it will run smoothly up until the point when it reaches the loading screen and simply returns me to the home screen. I try to reopen it and the same thing happens. I'm not really sure why this happens, but until this glitch is gone, I will be forced to stay away from the game entirely as the only way to fix this glitch is to download the game again which is quite time consuming.",
        "Marvelous game!!! Likely you back to the right on your last update.  I just purchased the chainsaw blade, the DRAGON blade was a huge desappointment we was expecting phenomenal motions not that catoon flag . Also : all the good stuff are in mini game, the others dojos are kind very less quality, let us use minigame blades and dojos in arcade or zen even by purchase that will be nice. Thank you",

        "Ive been playing for the better part of a year, and this game started out great for a long while. But IGG not only panders and gives better deals to Chinese people, cheaper packs etc. But literally 99% of all mega guilds and players are Chinese or Vietnamese. If your not asain don't play this game  you'll end up like me playing forever just to quit because of the obvious discrimination IGG holds with its playerbase",
        "Not a good game for new players.  Was fun and  interesting at first but you qucikly realise that you are just food for high level players with no way to reach a defensible level.  High level players basically teleport in, raid everyone and teleport out.  They should lock servers to keep it balanced and give more guidance for new players. This game is  clearly weighted towards the people who have been playing it the longest. Dont waste your time",
        "Kingdom 249 is open before just 50 days back. And one guild have 2B might. Most of the guys have millions of might one of them got 700M might. How's this is possible. Kingdom 277 is opened before 15 days back but one guild K03 got more powerful. Top guys got 120M might in just 15 days. Does IGG employees playing this game. We are lover of this game please don't lose your credibility. This two kingdom which I observed only Chinese players are strong. How overall kingdom only Chinese players got higher might in less time.",
        "This game is fun but be prepared for the mother of all Pay2win games.  These folks at IGG are experts at crafting new and exciting ways at fleecing their customers of every cent they can.  You CANNOT compete if u dont pay and pay often.  Players here ...just regular people... dump hundreds of rl $$$ regularly.  You have been warned.",
        "Do NOT go for high level military research without searching monster hunting, and Do NOT go for T4 if you not going to spent thousands of dollars. Even if you don't mind to wait 200 days, you will not able to afford it (lvl 10 military Def, Atk, Health cost 100m gold each). DO NOT GO FOR HIGH MILITARY AND T4 WITHOUT FULLY UNDERSTANDING THE GAME.",
        "Gameplay is good, not a lot to complain about. As far as purchasing via in-app, BE CAUTIOUS AS THEY HAVE LITTLE TO NO CARE ABOUT THE QUALITY OR THE QUANTITY OF THE SUPPLIES YOU PURCHASE FROM WHAT WAS ADVERTISED TO YOU. YOU WILL NOT SEE REIMBURSEMENT."

Sometimes the touch is too sensitive. Sometimes the touch is not sensitive enough which forces me to drag the product into the production slot up to 10 ten times just to start production. I know this feedback is not much but maybe an undo button will help. It makes the gameplay million times difference if you  put your players comfort a priority.",

        "I really like playing the game, it's fun with all the different character mechanics, but after the last update there has been a huge increase in ads that take me away from the game and open up play store or chrome. It does this in the middle of a round, so obviously it screws up my gameplay. Makes me consider paying for no ads, but also makes me want to delete.",
        "Game was fun the first day I downloaded it.  The next day it would freeze during the first battles and I would have to kill the app each time.  This happened multiple times already and with different characters.  I have an LG G5.  Deleting the app since it's not even playable for me.  Such a shame...love these angle games and this one has cool/funnt gameplay.",
        "Very fun and addictive. But there are these ads that open up my internet browser when I'm playing. Also, beeping noise came from the app. I immediately pressed the home button and the beeping stopped, so I know it's the app making those noises. Please fix the ad issue in the next update. :)",
        "An unbelievable amount of ads in an otherwise fun game.   Ads after every match and spam ads trying to open my web browser multiple times mid match, somtimes when I'm preparing my shot which completely ruins it. Such a shame the devs chose to ruin their own game because of greed. Sadly this is more common than not nowadays.",
        "Got some lag when playing pvp with random player. Oponent hp didn't decreased, even if i hit 'em. And also... Too many IN GAME ADS. (sometimes it's very annoying)."

What comes to music as I read in comments, I always play games without music so haven't listened to this game's. I play this game as a reward after working hard and I'm entirely satisfied. There have been no crashes so far. Lots of ads, though.",
        "I mean the game in itself is......alright  it could be a lot better.  I think the controls are rubbish and I understand it's meant to be \"skillfull\" but thats harder than skillfull, you can't even see where the circle is, this also adds to the game being bad. Having said all this you have also added rubbish music..... like you could have put something decent on. I get even more of an urge to uninstall the game every time I play it. Overall I definitely do NOT recommend this game. Game developers I hope you read this as it will probably help you to make the game better. I understand it would take a while but I don't care. If any of the game developers want to feedback on my feedback you are welcome to.Thank you.",

Do you enjoy being grabbed by the crotch so hard you change genders?  If you answered yes or no to any of these then no this game is not for you. It's nothing but a crappy game designed to rake in as much money as possible, rather than making something fun. Forced to watch 30 second ads after each round. Forced to use the currency you earn when you don't want too. Enemy power will suddenly jump up 10 fold making spells and goldimpossible to gain without watching an addition 30 second ad. Even if you win and get the key you are forced to watch a 30 sec ad to unlock as if you didn't get a key.",
        "Should be called adzy. During the level theres an ad banner at the bottom. At the end of every level there's an ad, some you can't skip and have to wait an entire 30 secs to sit through. To make matters worse, the chests can be boosted by 50% by watching, you guessed it, an ad.  They don't even give you a shop option to remove ads for a small amount of money or some sort of package. Pure plain greed",
        "All in all it is a really great game there are very few ads, its fun, the graphics are crisp. Its amazing except for one thing. On one of the levels all of the monsters have exactly 666 health and im not religious or anything but I'm pretty sure that if some one who is religious see's that, well lets just say that it might not be good for the company, so I suggest you fix this.  Thanks.",

        "It stopped working on my One plus! Help! I was excited about the side games! *********************************** Excellent, addictive fun. I reached shield 135 (level 1154) and it doesn't level up any more. Gutted! Still a great game but so sad I can't progress any more. No reason why really! Incidentally, good for helping kids with Mathematics.",
        "This game is simple. So simple that it is stupidly addictive at times when my mental and physical ability equates to a bowl of fruit. Nothing in this game brings me more satisfaction than the immensity of lag when bolts are caught in rapid bounce in a confined space. I say that with the utmost sincerity, no sarcasm at all. The lag is so intense, so joyful to watch. Please don't take it away from me. It is beautiful."

I love the tune that plays as you play it. It's so nostalgic. My brother isn't anymore with me but playing this game makes me really very happy. It's just like I am back in those old days. Specially for me, as it has so many memories, this game is the absolute best.",
        "The game is really addictive. but repeated zombie birds are generated and diamonds are getting wasted. Please change that. One bird one time please. One bird should be at max 3 level not another set. It's wasting my internet to watch video to get diamonds for collecting birds",
        "I personally loved this game. First off,  u cant jump for high periods of time cause u to run into the bombs. Secondly, whats sup with these prices? Thats ridiculous. You cant level up with prices that high and u have to buy üíé gems and coins just to get a level up... But tum... Very great game overall.",

There is Room for Improvement in the Amount of Coins Obtained in Completing Tasks, as Well as Eliminating Repetitious Tasks Requiring More Moves.",
        "Addictive, colourful and charming. I love it because I've spent zero real money on it and am at over level 280! I only use my in game coins when I'm desperate and I'm fine only playing a few times a day to let lives regenerate. Some levels are so frustrating but that's why you save the coins!",
        "I believe the game would be more relaxing if the timed levels were either gone or longer.  Also, 2 stars to complete almost anything is ridiculous.  Takes me a week to play a day.  And the rewards for levels should be higher.  Otherwise, the graphics are nice. The rewards are getting better, would still like 1 star to complete a task.",
        "Addictive, waiting 30 mins for a life is a pain. Also some of the levels are redicilously hard, esp when u get a rubbish sequence, always happens on lemonade levels!  Reason for 3 stars is mostly because, when u have struggled to get the stars for a task, when u open it, it's all chat & u have to get more stars to complete the actual task, I think that's unfair, 3 stars for a phone call, then another 3 for the job?  And the safe task? No option not to do it & can only prevail of the gamers winnings if u spend real money to buy the coins you earned.",
        "Enjoyable but just not enough lives. Phone conversations could be on 1 screen. I know that you can skip them but you might miss something important. Fed up with doing things like using lives to make calls and feeding and training the dog.  I originally gave it a higher rating, but now I've played for some time I realise it's not as great as I thought.  Too many lives used to gain just 1 star now. Need to be able to decorate more.",
        "Should make the money in higher value as it is very hard to accumulate.  Poor marks because it takes so much of your hard earned levels and drops you down the ranks if you don't solve immediately.  I was at ruby level and have so many points taken away now I am back to silver....uninstalling thanks for nothing."

        "This is by far the best chess \"trainer\" for me.  It's got a nice flow and the game isn't \"stupid\" like most other chess apps/games I've played.  I plat at least a few games every night and I feel like it give me a nice challenge and makes me really think about the moves I'm making.  Especially at the higher difficulty levels.  Overall a great chess app with no glitches and a good brain inside of it.  A must for a chess player with any real skill at the game.",
        "I really was worried it would be too easy or too tough. tho I am not a master, yet, I know my way around the board.  I realized it has been making me a spectacular player ..the computer does not just do the same dumb moves over and over its almost like its stalking me like prey around the board! ha great game!!!-!!",
        "I love this game and the best brain exerciser game ever in the history.  The cool 3d view makes the game as if I am playing on the real board, very good graphics. However, it doesn't show the list of killed chessman during game play the only drawback. I am expecting this upgradation and this will be the perfect Android chess.",
        "For the non experts, let me tell you that 5his game cheats. I sat with a real chessboard to analyse why wasn't I  able to crack master level.   And what i observed was it didn't allow you to make actual moves when you show high levels of intell8gence. Sometimes it makes moves which are faulty. I think there is some mistakes in coding, perhaps deliberately made.  So not a fair play but a foul play.",
        "So far it's o.k. I like the fact that it is simply a chess game with no fancy sound effects or graphics. I see no real reason to have the higher difficulty levels locked out until they are beaten but they are. I got it to practice with. It is useful for that. It's not bad...Just a simple down to earth chess game",
        "The game has been drawn because the other player has no legal move and is not in check. If they can ot move then I win because they cannot move to a legal position. The computer ends the games too early because they cannot be bothered to chase you around the board. You cannot unlock the higher difficulty games because it just says draw."

Made a purchase right off for a gun. Then I saw how much grinding is involved for the upgrades. The jump between a level 2 and 3 upgrade? Then the outfits, 2nd and 3rd weapons. Man. Sorry no thank you. This shooter however is very fun but the paywall is so well thought out I am not prepared to drop that kind of money. Learned my lesson losing 1k to Megopolis.",
        "I love the game. the game play itself is very self explanatory, quick and very good fps however, they have scammed me. I spent 12.99 on gbucks, the purchase was confirmed, and right after they asked me if i had liked to submit another card number for another purchase. I recall having credentials on a different prepaid visa card in my notes, so I go look, unfortunately I didn't have the CVS code for it. I go back to the game, it had reloaded but I didn't get my gbucks. I was a little confused as the purchase had been confirmed, and the money was taken off my card. I tried contacting them 3 separate times about it but obviously they aren't vigilant of their customers and don't take them as a priority. I recommend playing the game but avoid spending money on it. If I could get some help and get a refund on my card, or the gbucks I originally paid for, I will give it 5 stars, as I would like to.",
        "Great game with a lot of potential.... There can be so many more additions to make this fps better. More grenade varieties? A spectator mode? Clan levels that allow more players to join when we reacher higher levels? Gun balancing changes? I feel like the Cerberus should be buffed. It is expensive, and the 3 shots at once doesn't allow for many attempts for kills. Adventure mode for more gunbucks? Death match option? Allowing us to pick the map? I understand the game is fairly new, so keep on adding changes and new improvements. Thanks for listening!",

If u guys also provide  like that then ur game gonna be top in fps games üòÄ n mainly  not much places only 3-4... try to add more places n increase the area Size for more fun n more Dodge , now game look like playing in a pocket u guys need to increase area.",
        "Add more events like the festival for more incentives.. Want to earn more than trophies for each battle.. first place should get trophies win or lose.. let the time run all the way down during battles that last ten seconds makes a big difference...

        "Just way too many ads. Eventually you start having to watch an ad after every second other level. Its a free game, so I get it but the levels are so quick sometimes I'm watching more than I am playing. Fun game, though. Easy controls and great graphics and sound.",
        "Good fun and very addictive. I see people moaning about the adds üòß but what can you expect from a free game? You get an add pop up after about 5 puzzles and to be honest it is only for a few seconds....just close it if you don't want to see them.",
        "This game is outstanding. Love the graphics, simple to understand. Some appear quite easy and then you suddenly get a level that looks like it should be but has you scratching your head for AGES!!! Love it. I can live with the adverts, just wish i could put the phone down.",
        "Wonderful game, excellent graphics, its a free game, I solve 2 puzzles and a video ad plays I cant get over it, ad's are repeatedly played and I can't skip, but uninstalling cos too too much of ad's... after 2nd level game is very easy didn't find much interesting..",
        "This game is sooooo frustrating that the game made me through my phone on the ground. If you are good with controlling your stress then you should try it. But if your not good at controlling your stress then do not get it.",
        "Agree with other comments. Great graphics, fun to play, but the ADS!!!!!!!! eventually destroy the fun. Very repetitive after a while and challenge levels seem quite mixed. Have decided to delete the game mainly because of the ad onslaught. Other games have a much better ad/play psychology approach."

        "Very run game.  Just wish you could save your progress when you have to exit out for a phone call, text messages, reboot the device or anything that requires you to exit.  That's the only reason I gave 4 üåü's. Once they add save life option I will change to 5 üåü's. Great game though. Would recommend everyone to try this game.",
        "Nice gameplay, runs smoothly. Simple graphics. Good game overall, not much to complain with except for the lack of criminal jobs, or weapons like guns that you require to do such jobs, maybe adding a prostitute career would be nice. Just anything more crime related like a dealer or mafia or hitman.",
        "This is a decent game, but it needs a lot of work. I think there should be more options after school than just college then work average Joe jobs or go to prison. I suggest the possibility to get into politics, become president even (or prime minister, or not be able to at all depending on country), or join the military, and perhaps participate in wars if they arise. Right now, the game really only offers boring straightforward lives, and I hope that is changed.",

        "S very addictive entertaining I have played this for about 3 months before the game had fully come out it is very fun I really do recommend it a little we're like I need to listen to music while playing this but it's really fun and I love it I just actually like a little more instruction how to do some things but transition don't know how to do tha",

Not the case here. Man we have games that live life for you basically. But still cant figure out how to fix pac man. REALLY? And the ads an ad after every board. Ads ads ads and then guess what? Another ad. Very shameless",

My user is coolstaremojigirl and Mimi_Dev l Uh yeah uh But please give Everyone who starts 100 robux My favorite games r on toolbox is uh flee the facility Dance ur blox off I created that and Jailbreak And survivor have fun Playing roBLOX AND PLEASE I REquest That PUT ROBUX 100 IN THE PPL ACC WHO JOIN PLS",
        "Great game!! The thing I find ANNOYING is that nearly everything costs robux.. Yes, I do have robux right NOW, but for six months I didn't. I think every new account should get 100 robux.. For a cheap shirt, pants, hair and face! (And maybe bloxburg, too)",
        "LOVE IT!! But the controls for mobiles are... you know \"horrible\" and the screen are so glitchy and when I jumped or walked its a little late... and all of the famous games, I cant even play it... when I play it, it will load, it will let me play just for a second and then the screen will go freeze, and then BOOM! It will return to roblox home... hopefully the controls for mobiles can be fix and some other stuff that needs to be fix ‚âà) TY for this wonderful game and I love it!!‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• (BTW my profile is \"cutekittyloverMia25\") &gt;.&lt;",
        "During my free time, I like to spend time with my sister, she really enjoys this game so I enjoy it too. There are lots of games to choose from so you can never get bored. But I have one suggestion for the mobile version, please add parties, it is super hard to get on the popular games with her that she wants to play.",
        "I loved the game but seriously, you need to make the loading faster! I chose to play (for example: Fashion Famous) then I loaded it after 1 hour it doesn't still have loaded. I know tons of people want to play that but why so slow?? :&lt;",
        "Wow. What a waste of time and energy. Poorly made, nice idea but poorly done. Game doesnt work, on screen controls dont work on my tablet, bluetooth contoller joysticks work but no buttons work. No options for controller mapping. No real options for anything. My kid loves this game but i beleive it to be an unplayable piece of trash on my tablet. The only thing roblox accomplished was to frustrate and anger me. I do not recommend this game to anyone."

        "Classic UNO with a couple of modern twists and turns. I have never spent any real money in a game and I don't ever plan to, but here you also don't really need to. I've won many tournaments and got really far in the game without buying anything. You get extra coins by winning and completing daily tasks, as well as watching ads. But you're not forced to watch them. It's not just about luck. You have to play smart to win, just like any other card game. I love it.",
        "Tokens take too long to refill. Level up gives a few coins, why not a token refill? Tournament champion gets 4 tokens. 7 tokens for a day? Cheapskates! When do you want us to play, every 5 days? So cheap in giving prizes, guessing you want us to buy eh? I'll give myself a few weeks playing this game and am out. No daily prize wheel, just a daily \"less than 20 coins\" reward. Sooooooo cheap!",
        "It's just ok.  Hard to see your entire hand at times and some of the rules are different than the actual UNO game itself. When I contacted this apps tech support, they sounded as if they could care less and said they will not be making any changes to the game.  So I play until they want me to buy credits then I stop.  When they give me more free credits I play again.  I like the game UNO, just not this one so much.  Why do I still play?  Hmmm, that's a good question.",
        "Great game in the graphics department however, I agree with other consumers when they say the special abilities you can obtain by playing this game ruins it. Simple is best and this uno app is anything but. Sometimes when I log in, the tokens don't even recharge overnight and I have to wait a few more hours before I play three free rounds of uno before you have to pay for more tokens. Very hit and miss app.",
        "Okay, this is actually a decent game HOWEVER unless you buy your way through its almost impossible to win tournaments.  They shouldn't be putting people in the \"club\" and level 100+ with people who are like level 10 and not in this \"club\" it makes it almost impossible for them to win unless they're INSANELY lucky.  People with cheats can turn you from being at uno and winning, to being in last place in seconds and it honestly just kills the enjoyment of the game",
        "Would be good if someone actually thought about what they were making. This is an over computerized auto random winning when that person didnt actually win game. Many flaws need to be fixed. Start from scrat ch and make a more user friendly uno to play with my actual friends, not random people until I make it to level 5. Not cool."

        "I've liked this game for years. Some adjustments needed: realistically if gas goes empty and you're still coasting or you're in the air you should be able to coast until the vehicle completely stops or lands before the game stops. You've had the nitros in now which is great. However, you still haven't fixed the previous issue. IF I CAN COAST OR NITRO BOOST MYSELF TO A GAS CAN THAT'S LOGICAL. However, you stop the game before the vehicle stops moving which is in a sense, removing logic, and the law of motion!",
        "The best racing game ever, I've played this game along time ago. the first version it has 4/5 cars it was so fuuun.That was 5 years ago now I want to play it again.I feel the nostalgia ooohh the good old days.Now I'm going to install the game.U guys change my life Thank u guys soo much guys. I hope my tears will help u guys. :)",
        "Great game, but I only have one issue which prevents me from giving 5 stars. This issue is that the hot rod doesn't go as fast as it should, I know this because I have grown up around hot rods and Rockabilly since birth. This is only a small problem for me, but it prevents me from enjoying the game as much as I'd like to. Please improve it.",
        "Maybe some new vehicles? Taxi. Limo. Tow truck. Hearse.... maybe some new stages too? Under water. Race track. Bridges. Derby. Graveyard.  I originally posted this way back in 2015 and yet you said you are constantly improving the game??? We try and give you the developer new ideas but it seems that no one bothers to read our comments? I guess it's just a lack of interest. Hopefully this time someone will read it............",
        "Best game ever. I play it all the time even at work but people look at me stupid because im trying to keep from dying and tilting my phone like a moron.. Please make my efforts not be in vain!",
        "Plez put some changes in upgrading options..... Like..when we upgrade our vehicles...... Vehicles should look different...and..some added things like....nitros.,new wheels and etc.... By this changes this game will be liked and can be played by more and more people"

        "Love it and it really made  my brain thinking like do I want to risk lose money on wild card or go ahead to pick card from deck. When I won love that dog jump over three stars. I try to recalled did dog jump over two or one star. Maybe not. But still love it. Keep it coming",
        "The only thing I do not like about Grand Harvest Solitaire is not being able to earn more coins to play longer. Games cost 2000 coins to play and you don't win much more than 2000 so you're always relying on harvests for coin & unable to play until you build your coins back up by harvesting every hour...",
        "The game is so much fun and great game play and graphics, etc. But it has one fatal flaw. When you get to higher levels, it becomes way too expensive. I paid for extra credits twice but then realized how worthless it is. Sad because I'd be willing to pay for packages for bonuses but it's way too expensive to have to keep paying for rounds just to play.",
        "It's a joke. It is impossible to keep a game streak going because you earn less than you spend even if you get 3 stars on a level. Just a joke of a money grab. Hope your company goes out of business!",
        "It's a really fun and addictive game with one major flaw. After you start getting to the harder levels, you might as well quit and find a new game unless you only want to play one or two rounds an hour or pay to play. Every level costs coins to play and if you fail a level you are out pretty much your whole hourly allotment of coins. Winning a round doesn't make up for even one loss either. Love the game,  but really annoyed that I can't actually play it consistently enough to truly enjoy it."

Only thing I can complain about is that I wish all of the levels from these free versions were in the full version. I own the full version and would much prefer to be able to play these levels without ads and with all of the cool characters and colors I have unlocked. Other than that though, amazing work you guys, keep it up!",

I am pro at Geometry Dash Games and another one oh yea and there is Sub Zero(MK) name there like i saw them quickly. And i would say for the creator: plz. Creator keep the good work! Ok!!! And make more Geometry Dash and can u make something more fun for more people to play with!!!",

Robtop, you have regained full respect after what happened with meltdown. I'm just speechless, at the amount of work that was put into these three levels, going from the camera angles to the animations. This game is not like meltdown,  which is three short amateur levels, but with three long, harder levels. This game is like a preview to 2.2, and I know it's going to be good.  We'll done, Robtop! Keep up the great work!",
        "This just blows my mind... one thing I would like to see in the future is some rob-top made tutorials on how each editing items works in the game so other players can feel more comfortable making their own levels and not be intimidated by all the other fan made levels... I am one of those players who is intimidated by the other fan made levels... This could help young and creative minds to create their own levels their friends can enjoy. Thanks 10/10",
        "I love this game so much.  Some of the effects and colours added into the game make it so fun to play and watch. Its challenging and thats what makes it fun. Its not like one of those games that are so easy you finish it in an hour. This game takes time and effort. Also the backround music is pretty cool. Especially nock em with headphones. controls are very easy to use, just tap to jump and usually hold to use the vehicles, so easy! This game is perfect and absolutely fun. I would highly recommend downloading geometry dash subzero.",
        "Don't get me wrong, these new levels and songs are fun and addictive and all of the new stuff is awesome... but stop making new apps? Why not just update the original? It's kind of frustrating to have a paid version with stuff I've unlocked but have to deal with an unpaid version (aka, ads) and have to unlock skins and colors all over again because new apps keep being made."

        "Honestly i really enjoy the game thus far thank you for all the recent updates niantic... but there is one thing that has been bothering me and that is 1v1 with friends and trading... both features were shown in the original trailer... yet again i love the care your giving the game niantic i truly praise it but i would like to know whats happening with my 2 listed thoughts",
        "Simply just needs more events. I get why trading isnt available yet, which is to prevent RMT and if you have RMT that's just the end of the game. But hope you could soon add the 1v1 battle feature, BUT WITH MOVES LIKE THE REAL GAME NOT JUST TAP AND USING THE SPECIAL SKILL.   Overall love it tho, been walking 2km/day for 2 whole weeks now. (Lookin for a gastly xD)",
        "Please have more legendary raid events with gen 1 and 2 Pokemon for new and returning players who want to collect everything. With regards to using GPS and joystick cheats you guys actually benefit by getting more players from rural areas or dangerous areas playing and spending money. Besides you still have to do all the hard work minus the walking so it technically isn't that unfair to others especially since everyone is level 40 these days with legendary Pokemon. The game is already balanced just needs more events. Please consider a premium service to pay for where we can use a joystick in game. We can pay monthly or something so everyone benefits.",
        "I love this game! Been just playing on my wife's account. Just recently decided to make my own, and it will not let me get past choosing my first Pokemon. They all spawn in the same spot and it quickly shows error 11 or whatever and won't even register me moving. I've tried everything to toubleshoot and fix it. Nothings working. Really sucks because I love playing. Can someone fix this or tell me what's going on?",
        "thx for niantic that always listened our sugesttion, but i wish we can trade or battling with other player around the world by staying at poke center or else... - and btw you should update the new gym and new pokestop... since when i was on holiday in Indonesia theres not so much pokestop and gym around :( even there are many landmark in there - another suggestion plz maked some item that can be used to summon legendary/raid battle in location that we want, so its much easier  for the communities to do raid battle in specific location",
        "Can you developers make it so people can trade pokemon and other things like items? Itll make the game sooooo much better if teamates could trade items and Pokemon. People did it with cards, atleast to trade Pokemon. My bf and i play along with his friend David and when one of them need something that i got and visa versa, we should be able to trade. If you guys can make it happen, ill give this 5 stars instead of 4."

        "Excellent fun and a fantastic way to introduce a new audience to some wonderful classical music as well as very talented contempory composers. My one gripe is that recently players have been given multiple oportunities to get 3 crowns or very high scores with ad powered resources. I feel this takes a lot of the challenge from the game. Anyone can get 3 crowns in 4 or 5 goes where us old guard of the game did if in 1 or 2 Still an awesome game though and well worth the download anytime.",
        "This game can fit almost ANY personality type, keeping you entertained for hours!  Don't worry about getting low scores, because the game starts out slow and gets faster, so you'll always be prepared for faster tiles.  There are challenges where you challenge other people in the world!  I never want to give up on this game, its really addicting!",
        "I enjoy this game a lot and always loved how it challenged me. It was also fun when me and my friends would fight to see who's better but I dislike the update where they added boosters, it doesn't seem fair and for me it feel like it loses the title for being relaxing. I don't think that adding those futures was a great idea in my opinion and I really miss the old version a lot.",
        "This game has no WORLD'S favourite song  DESPACITO  SO i m hating it tooooo much  when i see this then i think that let's download it bcoz it contains despacito song also but when i see all album of this app then i started hated it. So i would request from CHEETAH GAMES that plezz add DESPACITO SONG also in it This is my humble request from CHEETAH GAMES.",
        "Great game. Played to level 120 and have over 500 gems but then I switched devices. This requires a Facebook account which I did not have. It worked for a little bit until Facebook disabled my account for doing nothing. They need to fix the method they use to sync progress. Now I am level 3 with 17 gems.",
        "I'm in love with this game. It's challenging, you don't have to listen to the music to follow the tiles, and it gives you the feeling to be better. I have a suggestion for a new song you can buy for diamonds. Can you add any song from the My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic TV show? Thanks."

        "I LOVE this game My only complaint is in campaign mode it's said more worlds coming soon for YEARS!!! If they're not going to add a world eny time soon  they should at least change the coming soon part. But overall this is a good game and it seems like Cubic Games really care about what the consumers think.",
        "This used to be really cool. If you want to be strong buy gem weapons. It is too hard too earn coins or.gems. Also your opponents must be with same armor or level. I once fought a guy with the minigun shotgun and diamond armor and before I rekt everyone with the demoman but now it sucks",
        "I think this game is brilliant. An absolute pleasure to play and I never get bored. This game should be voted one of the best games ever. Obviously I like other games but this is a whole different story. I just wanted to say please make it so u can join lower levels friends? I can't join my sister and were only five levels apart.",
        "Absolutely great game ,but you made some far too powerful guns too accessible early in the game, so I went down two trophies after I ran into a bunch of wallet warriors. And for God's sakes put a more powerful gun at the end of the campaign, I worked my ass off and it wasn't worth it. Other than that large rant, I love it so much and play it every day. Make exp,gold and diamond easier to obtain though.",
        "I don't like this update. Why does it cost so much to upgrade  weapons 2 more damage higher. And I don't like the fact that all the weapons that have low stars are nerfed. When I was on level 6 the hellraiser was a beast. Then when I got to level 7 I it wasn't as good, so I tried to upgrade it. BUT the price cost 120 coins. I am really disappointed about this. I played this game for 2 years and it sad to see how hard it is to win. They only want money that's it. Make your game better and fair. It's so unbalanced.",
        "It's a great game.... until you reach level 27, then there is a REDICULOUS difficulty curve. I was steadily climbing the tornament leaderboard, I was good, then I kept getting destroyed after hitting 27 with OP items and no gems to get the new weapons, because I had spent them leveling up my weapons and was out. What are you thinking? Lag, not double jumping, not firing when I need to, occasionally. How rediculous."

But it should really save to the cloud because I was on LVL 38 or something, I had everything, then I had to move to a new tablet and all of my game progress *poof* vanished!! Also, everything's a BIT expensive... Other than that, It's a really good game! Well done Outfit7 üòÑ‚ù§",

If you bought it you should be allowed to switch back and forth as you wish.    It's a really zen pass time  game :) also cute and interactive.",
        "This would totally be worth 5 stars if it weren't for the ADS. I get it's a free game, but its one thing to put an ad on the top or side of the screen. It's one thing to optionally watch ads for coins and prizes. But its another thing when full screen videos pop-up, pausing your game and wasting your time. I was honestly thinking about giving this 3 stars just b/c of how annoying that is alone.",

        "Best curling game I've seen Enjoy the graphics, controls, love the 1 on 1 against international players and career game options. Seems consistent and easy to learn. Needs a few tweaks like... throws that don't make hog line or touch hogline must be taken out of play. Have seen the bug that others reported, sometimes rock after thrown disappears , some kind of glitch that happens occasionally.  Sometimes the sweepers don't react to my movement to sweep. Would love to see 8 stones instead of 6. If you love curling, this should satisfy",
        "Great game except for hackers. There is a hack that allows some to bump or change finish of a throw. Yoy can go from having 2 scoring to opponent having the score, changing after the rocks stopped. Developers have not replied ti report. Fine for some fun but don't waste your money in upgrades",
        "Very fun game. Multiplayer is awsome! Please add private matches so i can play with friends.   Physics still need work to hold up to real world standard. Rocks dont follow thru on take outs in real life as they do in this game. Also (rules), a rock needs to make it all the way over the hogline in order to stay in play.  Thank you for making this game!",
        "The physics of this game are terrible. It's fatal flaw is if you have a completely frozen rock, you physically can't remove it, but this game you can completely remove 3 rocks even if they are all frozen. Also the free guard rule is very loosley applied. This game clearly was not created by someone who has ever curled.",
        "Physics are not like real curling, rocks are dead in the house when hit, physically impossible doubles and triples, improper use of the free guard zone rules (if a rock is in the house, it is free to be removed...not in this game).  Connecting people across the globe is a cool idea but you frequently lose people and you win without finishing a game.  I've played for 35 years so I speak from experience.",
        "Full of cheaters Started to play and it was awesome. But it seems that some people created cheats and make your pins move from their places without even theirs touching them so that they win points. I will not play it until its updated and try again. Too bad."

        "This is an awesome game that gives you daily and weekly quest's and offers treasure chests. Now they have new levels to play and collect like blazing sands, and the spooky summit level for Halloween. Then they added the new global challenges.This game just keeps growing, not like many of the other games that just stays the same..you will be amazed. Now they added Global challenges, with new head gear...like I said this game keeps growing...it runs so smooth and the graphics are awesome. If you haven't tried it. Do it. If you have come back and be amazed at the changes.",
        "Thx for updating Frozen Shadows. Blazing Sands still needs work. Too much water, not enough Sand. Needs a \"slide,\" I recommend sand surfing. The canyons also get boring. The variations between it and the other levels don't compare, especially for the gem cost to play it. Still, fun and relaxing, and stays fun. 4/5.",
        "I love all the graphics it's a bit like the        piano tiles it test's your fast skills but except it is temple run 2 love it. Except for the controls though cause sometimes if i turn it to right it goes to left and sometimes it bumps into the tree same to the left you need to fix the controls more.",
        "It's my favorite app. I love it a lot. My only issue is that it doesn't quite accurately update my stats especially my highest score without using a 'save me,' longest run, most coins & gems. I would really like the developers to look into that but otherwise it's a brilliant game.",
        "This is a good mindless game but the interactions have been inconsistent which leads to frustration. They also insist on scrolling through ALL achievements which pops up in the most inconvenient place and this happens multiple times per access, not just at the start. Possibly the most annoying thing ever. Also I would rather be able to pay to have ads removed besides special perks, the lack of this means this games life is limited to me.",
        "Nice, good, adventure game.but some times your team irritating who one completed thirteen level they will easily get diamond  your giving master challenge ( now the challenge Chinese New year )who one complete your giving thirty diamond only.this offer will useful only for entry level gamers. Most of players finished fourteen level so they no need diamonds.so think about genius players."

This makes for annoying gameplay. Plus without using real money it is damn near impossible to get the staff your hospital needs.",

Moreover, it doesn't allow me to suture the skin, even if I'm trying to do it right (it worked at the begining). Please fix these bugs or I will uninstal the game...",
        "Rebuilding that hospital in Africa is a total waste of time and resources. In the 2nd room, on the mission 9 out of 15, you really have a bug! The moment you complete 90% of the task, the pacient vital signs are dropping and there is no way to get them back. I continuously tryed for several days now and you simply cannot pass that task. Seriously?? Next step is to delete the game. Waste of time!",
        "I got a new phone and I did transfer everything and it transfer my game but it started at the beginning again  I put alot of money on this game.I need it back can some please tell me how to get my game back or money I spent over close to 200 dollars on this game is so addictive. I don't get it cause I thought all my games save on Google or facebook all my other games are were there left off so please tell me I didnt waste all that money to start from the begining. I made this comment like 5 days ago I emailed provider of game waited 2 days then called Google only for them to tell me I need to get in touch with the game provider. Then I sent another email with purchases I did and my email and my phone number and nobody still has got back to me or commented on my review. So what do I do now my patience is running out. I even called the number that Google has provided for me for the provider and all I get is a voicemail which I cannot leave a voicemail.",
        "Rip-off!                                Would be nice if the developers did not expect you to pay cash right away. It allows you to do two or three levels at the beginning and then it's been two days and I haven't been able to save up or accumulate enough resources to go any further. The only way to go further a little more prompt would be to pay money out of pocket. Not going to f****** happen.",
        "wap to Malay  an exciting game. but so hard to get a lot of staff. one room can only be 1 staff only. I always upgrade rooms but still cannot get a lot of staff. I have also bought recruitment and premium recruitment is still not many staffs i earned. I hope that this problem can be fix as soon as possible because I am very excited to play with this game.

        "I love the game, the crafting system is awesome, the gameplay is great. However, there are some points that I suggest  1. Nerf the Damned, also the Lepers, they are strong for beginners. Club or Cart Thills can't beat them easily 2. Make another way to find leek seeds 3. Lepers can detect you sneaking to them, and they spawn out of nowhere. I don't know if it is a bug to me or not. 4. Cooking meat uses too much wood.  I look forward for more updates. It's a great game to be honest.  Edit: I love the events, especially the cart one.",
        "I normally dont make reviews on games that i play unless it is really good. I love the hardcore atmosphere of the game,reminds me of the good old days when i still like playing minecraft. My only complaint is that the spawn rates for the undead e.g leepers, templars are too high in my opinion. Other than that. This is a great game",
        "Honestly it's a great game and lots of fun but that energy mechanic needs to change. I know you can walk but it's still such a strange thing to gate your players out of playing.  Maybe if you could always travel at the same speed but if you didn't spend energy you could be attacked randomly while you travel. Or if energy was used to speed up crafting. I dunno but it's the only thing holding me back from a perfect score.",
        "This game is awesome but here are the things like really want in the next game. 1. I need to disconnect with Google play to delete my old saved progress full of mistakes. Please add this feature. 2. Zombies are too hard to beat . Please decrease some of their capabilities. 3. There must be an increase in chest slots . 4. Please decrease the quantity of wood logs to cook. Otherwise all of our hardworking to gather logs while be replaced by only a few meats and others. 6. Please add another source of getting seeds. They are too hard to get.",
        "Loved the game. Beautiful work but sadly its designed to open your wallet and doesn't even seem like they bothered trying to hide the fact.  I hope they fix some things so that you can actually play it. I will continue to play in hopes that it improves if it does ill re rate it.",
        "The game is ok.. i love the idea.. but in all RPG and similar games you can accuire your items from when you died from your body in that zone.. also its good when you enter the inventory to pause the game.. when entering a zone the game should give some time before reseting the material and monsters if the player re-enters the same zone.. These are the most critical points so far i have encountered.. please take these in consideration.. thank you"

        "Awesome game!  Earning money is easy especially with online play and watching ads.  ONLY downfall is earning gold can be a pain,  seem like the only way to get gold is by beating a boss, buying gold with real cash and levelling up which can take some time.  Other then that it's a very addictive game if you love BMX that is.  Folloq me on instagram @evans_customz",
        "Very good game but I wish there was a better way of getting gold without having to pay out of your hard working money. Since when did games start asking for cash? I would pay to buy the game but buying gold is stupid as hell.. either way very good game",
        "Game is very addicting but after a little while of playing you can't hit jump or land! Maybe just me? Also, I don't want to pay for upgrades. Should be merit based on how well you race.",

        "This game is very fun and addictive but should have offline mode so we don't have to deal with a hacker every game.  Also after new update I'm having issues getting into the game. It says \"check comnection\" and my connection is fine even tried uninstalling it and all. Other games work on my phone and so does my Wi-Fi. The game just worked last night for me now it doesn't! PLEASE FIX!!",
        "Please bring back the old brewery map. I have been a long time player of this game, and loved the original brewery map. The new update of the map is so radical that it feels like an entirely different map, with all the pathways and corners. The uniqueness of the original brewery map is that it is small, and relatively open, so that combat is focussed and fun. There is more time fighting others than moving around trying to find enemy players. The new update just ruins that uniqueness, making it feel like the Bureau or Legacy map. I am okay with the new brewery map being a new addition, but please make it \"Brewery 2\" and bring back the original Brewery.",
        "Could you please add an offline mode...would be nice to practice on the go. Also please please please add more guns. I have been playing this game for a year and still no new guns but glad you are keeping up with the maps. I have this HUGE problem, it says check connection when I have good connection. I tried to restart my phone and reconnect but still doesn't work. PLEASE FIX.",
        "I love the game, it's great and there's not many fps games like these for mobile phones. My only problem is I can never play ranked. For whatever particular reason I can't even find other players. The game just stays searching forever and I really want to play ranked. I would have voted 5 stars but thats the only thing that bugs me. Please fix and will be happy to give 5 stars.",
        "Just good. This game is great. The controls are completely customizable so you can make it work the way you want it to. Graphics are on point, better than 2nd Gen consoles, lesser than 3rd gen. If this game came out in the age of the PS2 I would have bought it. Also, buy a box because this game couldn't have been cheap to make. This game should cost like $25.",
        "I love C-OPS. It is one of the best FPS games for Apple and Android devices. It is very popular, few servers are empty. On lowest settings with 2 gigabytes of RAM, it runs at a BUTTERY 50 frames per second. Also, controls can be customized. I just notice a few graphical glitches."

        "I really like this game, kind of wish the progression system was a bit quicker though, other than that, the tight controls, open world and variety of creatures you can eat make it a solid game. The special sharks look really cool, and I even considered buying one until I saw the 50$ price tag.   On a side note, what's the difference between this app and the Hungry Shark World?",
        "Winnings suck. Instructions are very vague. Way too many ads. Feel like in order to play you have to pay in order accomplish levels and continue story campaign. Sorry guys but I bet my criticism has been said over and over again. Result is boredom. Too many other games to waste my time playing. Need to fix these if you wish to keep this game on the market people!!!!",
        "i would rate 5 stars... but.. something with the cloud save broke, i used to have the megalodon, without any cheats.. but now i have the mako. could you fix this somehow? And do i email the support team? Im not good with all the emailing stuff.",
        "It's a really fun game, but sometimes you'll play a video to revive your shark and the video will play but you don't get another life afterwards. It's hard to believe that it is a WiFi problem because if it was an ad wouldn't be able to load at all. Also, I have paused the game before and come back minutes later and the game had kicked me out and not saved any coins/gems gained from that round. They clearly have a few bugs to work out.",
        "The game itself is cool but the cloud sync system sucks. It doesn't even asks the user if the user wish to keep the current locally saved file to be saved to the cloud or be back to square one. I synced my wife's Google account to save my progress still on this phone even my wife's account is synced into it since I am about to hand over this phone to her & purchase a new device to myself. When I did so, the entire progress was totally wiped out & it came back from the start. Tried to synced my own account back but the game progress was totally gone! Hopefully I'll get the developers attention into this for them to get this fixed. It totally messed up the entire game progress!",
        "IT IS SO GOOD, YOU HAVE TO BUY IT!Every level you get a new shark,though,you have to pay for them.But the good thing is you still have your old shark! You will be challenged throughout the levels! AND WHATEVER YOU DO,DO NOT SPEND YOUR JEMS!!!! You barely can get any jems,besides the five you get for downloading it.Anyway all I want to say is have fun be cool and be one with the shark! Bye,rsvp!"

        "This game was my favorite of any maybe ever. I played all the time, then there was an update and I had to uninstall. It made the app close constantly (even when it wasn't even open and I was in other apps), there's way too many ads that make me want to vomit, and it stats to lag now when it never did before. Someone at corporate ruined this game. Smh.",
        "Smooth control. Awesome idea . Not Much more I can say about it.(First Review). Now, my first thoughts about this game was that it was very good but as I have updated the game it has just been very slow and overturns when you tap. It also randomly takes you to the play store without tapping on an ad.",
        "The game itself is pretty fun. I think I'd like it. But the ads are far, far too intrusive. Not only are there too many. But, many of them have timers. Some are 30 seconds, and you can't break out. Too annoying. I have no interest I sitting and waiting for ads to finish",
        "Very enjoyable game, quite addictive and jumping back into a new game is quick. Couple of gripes, there seems to be some slow down or framrate dipping after an ad has shown and the option to remove ads isn't working. Sort this out and it will get another 2 stars",
        "The game was awesome and I loved it. But the latest update ruined it with ADS. They put the banner exactly where you mostly tap with the fingers to change direction, the game got laggy which it was not before and has started getting way too many pop ups. Uninstalling. *Sigh*",
        "A lot of frame rate issues. Lost many runs because controls become unresponsive while gameplay continued. Ads are incredible intrusive. That said, it can be really fun if they cleaned up the coding on this simple game."

This is an issue as once i did this and fell into the water not being able to get back on. Also, the spikes do not seem to have an effect on the shark so they are useless. I do believe that the developer needs to continue to work on this game and introduce new items and uses for them.",
        "You cannot walk on wooden fundations and you cannot walk on single or double foundations. Please fix this it is very annoying and im not able to play the game, because when the shark attacks in a corner you cannot hit him with your spear. This is the same for the zombie. I built a little house on the raft and it spawned behind the wall of my house. Please fix it",
        "It's honestly a pretty good game, it's fun, even though there's no real end goal and a lack of side quests. Although many improvements can be made to the game, the worst part is the ads, it's really bad, and it's insulting as a player that they try to milk this much out of us. You have constant random ads that take over your game at any moment. 5 ads per chest you craft to unlock each slot, ads when you switch to the map, floating treasure chests that require ads to open, even more pointless ads at every crafting bench, and the list goes on. I would gladly even pay to play an ad free version, but this is just ridiculous.",

        "Game is good, but why on Earth does it consume up to 150 MB of phone storage?  Surely the collectable balls can't be requiring that much data storage.  After clearing cache and data the app alone takes 90MB.",
        "Hi everyone!  I'm really not a fan of this game, I mean it's ok I'm not going to lie but is very boring. The graphics are ok but it is repetitive. I suppose it is quite addictive but I lost interest after a few goes. It wasn't my cup of tea so to speak. I hope this review was helpful and remember to give it a big thumbs up!!! Be sure to look out for my trade mark \"Xxx\" and I'll see you next time!! Bye! Xxx. üëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüëç",

        "Everything was perfect for a month or two until one day I hop onto the app to find my high score reset to 0, all my progress on the challenge levels gone, and a few of my unlocked basketballs disappeared.",
        "I like this game. I purchased it because it deserves, also I want to remove ads. 3,50 ‚Ç¨ and ads are not removed completely. I'm disappointed, expecially for the \"restore purchase\" button that not works. Despite this I think that as a game is fun but monotonous in the long run, defect of 90% of apps of this kind. I hope developers will add something with updates that are not other challenges that ofter go to luck (and waiting time should e removed also). Sometimes there are some bugs but irrilevant for gameplay. The development house has made other interesting apps too. Sorry for errors, is not my first language."

        "THIS IS THE BEST GAME EVER!!! I totally recommend it to EVERYONE who loves addictive games and dragons. I find myself constantly playing this game all the time! I honestly feel like I can't say how much I LOVE this game with words. Again, this is the best game a player can have. Just one thing, I wish there were more ways to get gems instead of just buying 'cause I can't buy anything. So please make gems more easier to get.üòä",
        "The is very fun because I have been playing since I was a kid and I still find it fun.  In the future sometimes instead of race can there a event where multiple players fight a power boss like dragon and the people are given prizes depending on there rank and they have to do a certain amount of damage to get the rewards instead of just letting them get it without trying",
        "You know what? I was a long time gamer of this game. I breed a lot of dragons but eventually, all dragons that I hatched and feed are all gone. I don't know where it go but I know myself that I didn't sell any dragons unless I alrrady have that kind of dragon but then the pattern and patience of waiting an egg to hatch become a waste. Sad for my dear city.",
        "Don't waste your time with this game. It started out as a really awesome game until I found out that the developers only care about getting your money and after they get your money they don't give you what you paid for and you spend a week fighting with the developers to get what you purchase. After you get to a certain level in the game you can either buy the gems so you can continue your progress or stay stuck where you are. I am uninstalling this game and I suggest that you don't waste your time with this game.",
        "I'm hoping the update today fixes the glitches.  I got kicked out of a league match cause my device froze.  Never did that before til yesterdays update.  Please fix and I will give everything a five star",
        "It is a good concept, but it is literally begging for money. I didn't log into Facebook so I have to pay like 20 gems just to be able to get my level limit for dragons +5. To get a metal habitat, I need to pay gems. To expand, as I am not logged into Facebook and so cannot pay by gold, I have to pay gems. It is so frustrating."

Till now my highest score is 74 & I'm in challenge 25. Really loved this game very much. I recommend this game to my each & every friend...(even my enemy also...üòÇüòÇ Just kidding) I wished that I will cross 1000+ score on future.  Loved this game. Lots of Love to this game & ketchapp. üòòüòòüòò‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è",
        "A simple, addictive yet hard and raging game. I love how you can customize your spheres and roads--and to turn off the ads just turn off your WiFi or data. Honestly, after 250 it gets a little impossible to play lol. Keep up the good work, Ketchapp!",
        "Another great game from ketchapp. A very unique idea, executed well and with nice graphics. It is simple yet difficult, a good combination. I gave it 4 stars however, as sometimes the game takes a while to respond to my touch, and often doesn't respond at all. My phone is quite slow though, so I'm willing to give the game the benefit of the doubt.",
        "Enjoyed, On a overall basis i really enjoyed the game. And i also finished all the 100 challenges within a time of 5 days, as the game is really captivating i kept on continuously playing it. But now i am kind of bored from it as there's nothing to do after i have completed the 100 challenges. If there is an addition of another 100 more challenges that would make the game more fun to play and i would enjoy it thoroughly. Also i am not sure how will i earn the other spehers and roads without any challenges, so if anyone can help me how in figuring that out it would be really nice. At the end the game is really good. Cheers to the creaters.",
        "I've noticed that when I get higher in the challenges the ones involving lane switching glitch out and never let me complete it. I have counted and I don't think it is possible for me to have counted incorrectly 20+ times repeatedly. Also now whenever I boot up the game it has the beginner tutorial pop-up telling you what to do which is annoying.",
        "Fun little time killer. My only problem is that daily rewards fail to show up most days. It could be a problem on my end, but I don't know, and it's a pretty small issue so I don't really care."

        "Developers, please read.  First, this is a fun game and I enjoy its play style. It's reminiscent of TV shows like Battles Bots and game series' like Bot Arena.   Second, I would like to suggest giving players the ability to add, delete, and move weapon, utility, and wheel anchors. In the same way players can currently add enhancements to parts and chassis's and move around stickers.   Third, It would be appreciated if Quick Play Super Boxes replaced Regular Boxes after all shipment slots are full. It would provide a greater incentive to keep playing Quick Play beyond just Winning Streak Crown Rewards.  I'm offering these suggestions because I really enjoy this game and would like to see it become a more fulfilling and personalized experience.  Thank you,",
        "This game is have potential, don't ruined it because of money. I have never been watching so many ads In my life just to get some 2 stars parts. Instead of being creative and making cool machines, this game is turning to - either pay to win or watch alot of ads to win. What's the point of \"playing\" in this game?",
        "I think this app is great! But there is a slight problem with selling items. When I repeatedly sell items, sometimes if, for example, I was selling an item for 6831 coins, then it would subtract 6831 from the total amount of coins I have and then add back in 6831 so I'd end up with just the same amount of coins I was at! Could you please fix this small bug? It would make this app even better!",
        "Good game fun to play spent cash in-game. One issue my moat recent purchase I bought 4 boxes and a bundle of gems in a deal, I got the gems and one of the boxes then my game said there was an error and reloaded leaving me without my other boxes!!! Other than this it's a fun and easy game with little to no major issues",
        "I absolutely love this game. I spend a lot of time on it! It's fairly balanced between players who play for free and those who purchase gems to give their bots better stats. You can easily rank up without paying a dime. I did for so long, until I kept hoarding pieces and didn't want to sell. I began to use gems instead of coins.",
        "Fun strategy game, just wish it was easier to understand upgrades and easier to get a decent vehicle. Sometimes you have to wait for boxes other times you can watch ads to get thru them with no rhyme or reason as far as I can tell. The variety or maybe the lack of variety in boxes is pretty annoying. Sometimes you get the exact same part multiple times or with slight variations, which can drag out trying to get a decent upgrade on things."

Good luck but I am going to use my Minecraft because it actually functions properly. Nice attempt at trying to copy the original.",
        "YAY! FINALLY A GAME LIKE MINECRAFT!!!!!!! Except it doesn't have stuff like the animals, buckets, iron doors eg. But what is the Nether react core? It is just a made up block. But please add stuff like levers, iron doors, animals, Redstone, Buttons, iron trapdoors, texture packs, adventure mode,  Redstone torch's, Hoppers, Ripeters, dimensions like the Nether and The End, And other stuff from the game, \"Minecraft\". Also, add skin packs and make it like people can see there hand, and add mobs like dogs, cats, birds, rabbits, and foxes. Dogs, Man's best friend. Cats, Always cute. Birds, Watch them well you build. Rabbits, See them jump. Foxes. See one on an adventure. Please Also pay for Minecraft if you want it for stuff like Creepers. Also, add farm animals like chickens, sheep, cows, And other stuff like that. But plz do it. Also, add all paintings, pictures from Minecraft, and caves. I will Enjoy the game more if you do. Bye!",
        "Love the game! My only problem is that for some reason, when I grow wheat and try to get a cow to follow me, well they just ignore me. I haven't been able to find carrots for the pigs either. Frankly, I would like to be able breed animals pure and simple. Otherwise good job",
        "I really like this game. I've never played Minecraft and since it cost money to download the app, this is something fun for me to play and not need to spend money. The only issue I have is in survival mode there doesn't seem to be enough cows, and I have only managed to make some shoe armor. But then again, there's a lot I haven't figured out yet, but it's been fun learning."

        "Good game however, once you've taken control of all the islands there is little else to keep you interested. I would look at adding more world's and making the trading a real economy by having the ability to buy items and sell them for a profit in different ports. Potentially even have your ports taken over again or mutiny so you need to recapture them.",
        "Overall the game is great. Gameplay is smooth but slow (hey, old ships), making the gameplay calming. Graphics are pleasing to the eyes, though it could still need improvements. Sounds are calming too.   You guys should change the image for the gold coins since it resembles a symbol in One Piece. And also the whale movement could be smoother and slower. You could add more creatures in the ocean in addition to the whale since its just blank at times.",
        "It's a really great game! I'm really looking forward to an update. I think it'd be REALLY helpful to be able to purchase an extra boat that just goes around and picks up boxes.. Having to turn around all the time gets tedious. Also an online pvp would be awesome. Maybe have the ability to make clans with your friends that can attack other clans. I'm looking forward to see what you guys do!",
        "This game is great overall and you have a great sense of progression as your ship gets bigger and faster. The problem is the controls themselves. I found it very hard( I noticed this when I reached HP or ship level 6 ) and sometimes close to impossible to fire at other ship even at point blank range. The game has a very hard time trying to focus on one ship and would often shoot at where the enemy was 3 seconds ago especially when there is more than 3 ships at once which often happens. I would recommend a fire button option to compliment the controls and the gameplay experience. As I said before, it is indeed a very amusing game and would be even more enjoyable with this added feature.",
        "please, please, please. update more maps or make it more challenging, ive already conquered all the islands and there's not much i can do anymore. so please, either more maps, or let others conquer my islands and let me reclaim it. i know you guys can still add up to this already amazing game. also, improve the controls, really cant see much when im steering. but over all, its a really fun, relaxing game. ;) thank you.",
        "One of me and my sister's favourite game. But we wish we could play together same team or against each other with bots. We don't  want to be against online players. If you guys do that I will tell alllllll my friends to play. Anyway great job keep up the work , you guys are greatüòÅ"

        "What really drew me into this game was the the Pac-Man promotion, I love a good crossover and I can say with total certainty that I wouldn't be playing it if I couldn't play as Pac-Man, he's such a good inclusion. It's a super addictive game, setting it aside to do something else is quite difficult, hours go be seamlessly when playing it. The graphics as well are beautiful, very vibrant and colourful.   I have a few minor gripes with the game though, it crashed on me and when I restarted the game I had briefly lost all my content, that gave me a minor scare. The game is heavily geared towards microtransactions as well, unless you're prepared to pay money, get ready for a very, very long grind trying to get the stuff you want. Having said all that I absolutely love the game, very glad I downloaded it.",
        "Sonic run is a fun speed based game I play it about 20 mins a day! P.s. PLS ADD CHAOS  and I still know that chaos is in forces speed battle but still and also why didn't we have a chaos fight?",
        "Game looks good and it's well design, but far too many gimmicks and interruption. Hardly ever can actually run. Plus some silly hanging in the air for no reason. Got bored in 5 m",
        "This game is one of the best out there. Now I know it might seem like a remake of Subway Surfers or any other endless runner game out there, but I must say, Sonic Dash is much more than that. You can do way more in this game than you could in Subway Surfers. I would recommend this game of you haven't tried it. It's occupies time and above all else, this is a great game!",
        "Sonic Dash has a plethora of characters to unlock and play as. Some require real money, but most of them can be unlocked with Red Star Rings, and all of the characters can be won through events. You can even get Classic Sonic and Green Hill Zone! And every once in a while, they'll add some characters from different franchises to run as for a limited time, and if you unlock them, you'll be able to play as them forever.",
        "It was good. Mostly positive things to say. I wish I could go from one round to the next faster, though, without all of that extra stuff. Also, way too many ads."

For the last four months I have gotten the same tier one and two cars over and over again. If you don't mind spending that much money, it's great. As for me, it just became a major turnoff.",

Everyone has their own way of saying, yes that's how I would if I really could.  You end up creating a bond or developing a relationship  with it.  Take it to the next level!  Gear ratios and n02 pushezes and grip are all good but let's envelop.  I know I would play more if I could truly express my kickass whip that represents  me that I have to drive!  You have a clean and immersive game. Less is more.  Thank you",
        "Everything about this game is totally incredible and great fun. Love it. However I am disappointed after the early Feb update that affected the performance of all of my cars. I've contacted support and they say the development team is working to bring us the best gaming experience.....Hopefully they can restore my cars to their previous performance sometime very soon, but it's been almost a month so far.",
        "I love this game! It's really addicting quick. Since it has an online feature, there is basically no end to how much fun you can have with it. I think it would be much better if you could add your own body upgrades. As in body kits, spoilers, etc. It would allow the players to have very personalized vehicles.",
        "Game is really great! Amazing graphics, amazing cars, lots of continuous fun! A few bugs and connection issues which can be frustrating at times especially when your team depends on you for points. Though I believe they'll eventually fix these issues as this is the BEST racing game out there and it's only getting BETTER!",

I do suffer from that first race was on Dec 312017 as of Feb 22, 2018 I have 208 hrs on the track 23 in the garage own 22 cars and spent over a Benjamin on it in less than a month. Ya gotta have some smarts to play and win. Money helps with extras. Only time I've had a issue with it was this morning a season ended I was upgrading a Tier 5 car and paid with game money and didn't receive part. Still a 10 star game... Great job Developers!!"

Numbing my emotions and attachments to the people and places I visited was a challenge, but I soon realized the benefit... because now I was unstoppable.<br><br>**** INTENSE GAME PLAY **** <br>Launch a fun, fast-paced 3D mobile gaming experience upon downloading this addictive FPS game.

        "Everything was great except in the beginning it kept saying I didn't find any mice but I found them twice on the first one.. but then I restarted it and it worked fine.. until it kept freezing and I had to restart my tablet.. after doing that like 5 times it worked great thru out the whole game.. I kinda felt like it was a lot shorter then the other games. But other then that I had fun playing it and I'm super excited for other to come out so hurryyy!!!!!!! Lol",
        "This is just like the other game you guys made, the one with the doctor in the hospital, down to the exact same thing of \"play the first couple of levels for free but if you like you pay\" I bet this one is for the same price. On a side note, the story is different but the game play is the same, go have a look if you want. I will say this is a good game and I take nothing away from the hard work you have done. Good looking graphics, good smooth game play. A game you can get into and do try the other games of this developers you may like it as well. Over all a good game I just do not think it is worth $15. But best of luck guys.",
        "Great game  I don't normally spend the Ching on many games. . This has a different take of an old favorite.  But none of the challenge levels are working on my game.  Once it's over, nothing happens.  I don't get credit for work achieved and I have to restart with same result. A glitch. Waiting for update",
        "Sometimes the game did responding to my tap. And what makes me very angry is i had to redo challenge several times because of the game stop (no \"level complete\" appear), lily parker just stand still, nothing happens...all i can do is tap setting button and choose : back to map or rerty the level.. i counter this issue on challenge mission only, not yet in normal mission.. And it's very annoying",
        "Love these games. I've purchased them all from different sagas. I'm just encountering a  problem with this one in particular. At the end of every challenge it glitches and I can't get my rewards. It stays on the challenge and I have to go back to the menu and play again. Pretty frustrating. Hoping it can be resolved.",
        "I've bought nearly most of these games and this one has disappointed me most. When I finish a level it won't actually finish so I have to keep restarting it. Also some of the bonus levels are hard to understand what I'm supposed to do. I don't know if it's a bug but it's kinda annoying. Apart from the bug, just like the Delicious games etc it's great. Just need to fix the bugs :)"

Maybe a later update brings a fix..................",

They all sound basically the same and there are at least 200 that say \"best racing game\" or \"best racing game ever\" word for word. Do better. You made a great game, just fix the bugs and stop faking it.",
        "I first got this game because it seemed interesting and whatnot, but I then completed the tutorial and went on to race other people but when I pressed the race button, I lost 20 energy but I didn't go on to race anyone or do anything else really. I then pressed to race button again and again and nothing happened other than me losing all of my energy. I don't know why this happened but I'd like compensation, thank you.",
        "Was a great game but is all messed up now.  Freezing, dropping, can barely even get races to start.  Don't know what happened but it needs to be fixed back to the way it used to be. If fixed would be all 5 stars.",
        "I'm fed up of this game taking away my energy but not even putting me in a race! And I don't even get reimbursed for it! It connects and puts me in a race sometimes but nobody is there.... or sometimes it just glitches before putting me in to the race.......... sort it out. I'm deleting this bull.",
        "Few glitches where it takes fuel, then never starts a race search.   But it isn't bad if I've played every day since I downloaded it.  34 consecutive days so far!",
        "Hard to rate higher than one when it's so bugged that you can't actually race. Fix the bugs so it becomes playable again. New update just made it worse. Real shame as this is a cool game when it works."

        "Just downloaded this app.  So far a very well executed app with excellent layout and controls/easy and fluid to use.  Much better than other Sodoku b/c no ads during actual game play!  The only \"con\" is that I cant put graphics behind gameboard. Only suggestion: Would like to see options for backgrounds like in Solitaire. This would truely make it a 5 star game!   Ps. I was not paid/reimbursed or otherwise incentivised for this review in any way.",
        "Great app! Loads quickly, gameplay is smooth and intuitive. I also haven't found the different levels of difficulty to be repetitive, which is a good thing. I have found with other Sudoku apps, a pattern emerges from each of difficulty so that I almost know what the puzzle will look like by picking how hard it will be.  This one isn't like that thankfully!",
        "Easy to use.   Love the pencil so you can mark choices.   Also like that it tells you if you make a stupid mistake like putting the same number in a column.   Haven't tried the hint feature yet,  but hoping it will help me learn when I don't see any options.",
        "The game is nearly perfect. I enjoy this game very much. But the constant notifications, and/or asking for a review are annoying and unnecessary interruptions (note that notifications are being disabled!).",
        "The only thing I don't love about it is the advertising... but I suppose that's the price of free games. Otherwise, it's fantastic!",
        "This is so easy to use and so addictive. I wasn't good at sudokus before and now I can complete several a day with varying difficulty levels. Very entertaining. The daily challenge is an awesome addition to the game as well. Recommended."

I would like it more if you improve the physics of the game like curving the ball etc....please make it....",

This game is literally the best ever. 01.03.18 Although in the new update I went to type something on leagues and the game just crashed, it also made my phone spam so I had to shut it down and reload my phone up, please investigate this.",

The camera angle at corners is terrible. How did you make it worse? Before update would have given it a five star rating, now three.",

I actually have a no like about this game which is that it drains your battery usage fast and that's not good. The overall of the game is OK but they can add updates to make it better.",

Once i played against 98 ovr player. He had 2 great and 6 good chances, i had 6 good chances and 0 great. It isnt ok.",

Thank-you and keep up the awesome work.  *UPDATE* 17 FEB 2018.  Have started my friends and family trying to get Top Score. No one is really trying as they are all enjoying playing the app to care. Brought a tear to my eye. Once again, \"Thank-you\"  for a truly  wonderful game.",
        "Simple tile game with a nice learning curve. Easy enough to be able to relax while playing and challenging enough to not be boring.  Instant gratification for finishing levels, packs, and difficulty ratings.  There are 'rolling points' that I haven't figured out the use for yet. Coins to purchase hints and other stuff. The ball can have different 'skins' that you unlock as you complete grpups of packs.  TLDR?  I'm having fun. Maybe you can too.",
        "The graphics, controls, n the gameplay are ALL 5 by me. I was expecting this game to be boring but finally, i downloaded it n it was a BLAST! I could NEVER take my eyes off this game as its AMAZINGLY fun. I was not expecting it to be THAT fun, but it was!!! There is absouloutly NOTHING WRONG about this game. The only  thing that is wrong is when people say bad things about this game. But there are NO glitches, barely no adds n NO expectations! This game is absouloutly my MOST favourite  game OF ALL the others.üëç",
        "Great game. Starts easy so you can get your eye in and then gets harder. Fun to play and not so difficult that you give up and uninstal. Ads are over fairly quickly and I like that you can choose to watch some to get extra coins.",

Each time when u invite me to rate this app i was thinking that i shall rate this 5 if i win the 75th level. Now iam satisfied.... Great timepass.. Nice tactics, waiting 4 more awsome funny levels. If anybody has any diffrnt opinion cntact me on telegram @chichu  this is my user name. Thnx 4 thiz awsome gift babe.",
        "The game is really interesting and entertaining. The graphics are smooth and and the controls are manageable.   The thing I disliked through my game play is that you don't get any clues what you have to do and/or how to defeat the new \"enemies\". While you understand what exactly you have to do, you've lost some lives. But that's not so important.  I will strongly recommend this game just because of its graphics, entertainment and due the fact, that this game is not pay-to-win game.",
        "I really liked this game. The levels are very challenging and this game is addictive and fun. The only issue is that there are only 5 short lives  that when our lives ran out, we have to wait 18-19 minutes long to have 5 lives again. Of course, there are many hard levels in the game that keeps us dying and think a way to pass the level. So if possible, please shorten the time, like 5-7 minutes only and let us really enjoy the game. It's more even challenging and thrilling if there are many lives. And this game will be really perfect for us. Thank you.",
        "Remember the old days when platformers taught you through trial and error how to interact with new game mechanics? If you don't like that, you'll hate this game. So much fun, so creative, and once you start to get down one of the new features, it ramps it up and keeps you learning creatively how to beat the level. I love this game, it's a fantastic platformer that will challenge you to learn as you go instead of giving you a tutorial every time something new comes up.",
        "Completed all but just couldn't get enough of it. Everyone should play Redball 4. It is D best android games I've ever played. Those who complained about the Game play and control has an abnormal thumb. Easy, Fun & Challenging but nothing impossible to get through. I just hope they make new levels.",
        "I love this game üòçüòç it is my favourite but.... I don't like The lives system . I have to wait for it . I know that there is a pro version but.. can you please give us one or 2 extra lives when we complete a level? I think it's a great ideaüòãüòã btw i loved it üòçüòçüòç ill give it 5 stars thenüòäüòä"

        "I get that ads should be used to support a free app.. But this game is unplayable due to every ad they insert. Literally after every action is another 30 sec ad. You can't even play the main game because they kill you with ads. Uninstalling.",
        "I really enjoy this game but there are too many ads and it crashes every now and then. Online play is kind of bad because it pairs you with ppl that dont ever play and if they do its every couple days until you can play your turn, which could be just to discard a card. I do absolutely like this game. I play actual card game still to this day. Great app just needs work. Will update more stars after updates start coming out.",
        "Would be nice if the game would stop glitching and making me lose coins. Edit: I was excited about the update but there's still glitches!! You pay a coin to use the extra card in your hand boost and the robots get to have 5 cards but you only get 2 or 3 or if you're lucky you'll get 4 cards in total in your hand.",
        "I love the game, the set up is great but if you want more people to actually play the you get rid of some of the ads. I completely understand that the ads are a key point but not it is annoying while your in a middle of a game and an ad pop up. Sorry but it makes me not want to play. I have never wrote a comment or rated a game for the simple fact that if I didn't like it I would just delete the app or game but I took my time to write this one because I really love this game and it brings back lots of childhood memories and I don't have to actually sit down and play with others",
        "So many ads they interfere with gameplay! What should be a quick turn becomes a 3 minute play. I don't ads, I support developers making money and even click on ads for bonuses, but this is ridiculous. The game is also laggy, which I suspect if from the ads trying to load. Expect game crashes as well - one occurs every gameplay for me."

NOW    only  the same 5 of my 30 dragons get out and this is making collecting bricks and healing power very slow. l have not seen all my green dragons and moon dragons( the hardest workers) for 2 days now. developers please help or l will stop playing. TY.",
        "I would love to give this game 5 stars but 99% of the ground I've uncovered is covered by \"treasure chests\" and there's no way to get rid of them or contact the game makers for help. I've completely run out of space and can't play anymore. The chests should disappear after 3 - 5 days if they're not opened.",
        "Love this game. Graphics are great and so much to do. Keeps me going for ages. Main concern and the reason I've not rated 5 star is the time it takes to get each token. When some levels take 7 and it takes half a day to fill up it's a major pain. Then you do a level that needs 4 and the next also 4 it takes the p*ss. Would be great to have a higher limit without getting charged or for them to fill up quicker. If this was done I would rate 5 star all round.",
        "Playing this game makes me lose track of time. Wish we could buy the dragon egg chests with game coins.  That would be greatly helpful. Please consider this. Also would be great to transfer items from other levels back to the camp, like eggs, flowers, etc. Plz have this feature.Thanks. Plus would help if there was a set button to hit to exit the game. I am finding it takes between a few to about 5 times to hit the back button on my tablet. Plz fix, would make things alot quicker.",
        "You can earn a Max amount of 7 chalices at one time, and it takes a long time to re-accumulate chalices (some levels require the max amount of chalices in order to play level), and do not like the timed levels at all. I am on one now, and don't even want to play it, as I have run out of time, and it uses chalices up each time I play, and lose. Please remove these, liked the game a lot more before the timed levels were added. Otherwise, love the game.",
        "Buggy.  The game itself was pretty good but there are issues with the cloud save deleting peoples games + all their in-app purchases (like me). The support for the game is non-existent. They have one email address to send issues to, and it's been weeks, almost a month, since and there has been no response. So everything is gone and they can't be bothered to try and restore my account for a month.   In short, it was fun and addictive, but your game will delete itself eventually and the support staff doesn't care since they already have your money."

        "Love the app. Great time killer. Certain times of the day when playing I notice a change of cards I get dealt usually the after noon I start losing every hand forcing me to get off. I have a straight the next person always has a higher hand. Seems suspicious. I know u can't win all the time but still. Also private tables where only friends/poker buddy's can join would be a definite plus to add to the game. As some of the randoms just f around and bet all in from the start.",
        "For a poker fan that doesn't know this game it's worth the gamble lol. The game play is good, poor player avatar customisation options as it's simply a small selection of picture options with no options for using one's social media profile pic. To that end frequently there are multiple players with the same profile pic. It struggles a bit as a social game of cards because conversation is limited by time. It has nothing to stand it out & above other poker game apps for either negative or positive reasons. If you just want to play a good game of poker with random people from around the planet though it won't disappoint. It does give the option to buy top up chips and a daily option to get chips for free from both in game buddies and a poker machine. From the entertainment point of view it ticks all the right boxes.",
        "I recommend not to install. You can get banned anytime even without a warning or any explanation, and when u contact support you will get auto response. Bad customer support. I got banned a second after reporting two cheaters or bots idk and they took my 12 billions.",
        "Hands dont seem to be computer greedy to take your chips. Nor give higher level players generated wins with getting obvious flop or river cards giving them a win on a ridiculous hand they go all in on.",
        "Cards are not random at all. No one gets that many flushes in one game. Please apply a new patch to fix your issues!!! Also three people in one hand should not have K-10 with K-10 on the table!! Improbable, if it ever happened in real life id think the sky was falling. Other wise an ok game but the games are in a pattern and easily predictable. Please fix!!!",
        "Much better than years ago.  So far nice players, no problems with bad play.  Disconnects once in awhile but recovers quickly.  I do not like the betting is done but maybe I have to use a lighter touch so it doesn't expand the window so I can't see the game"

        "(REAL REVIEW! NOT A PAID REVIEWER) Really enjoying the game. It's a good time killer. Some levels are a lot of fun and actually require a little bit of skill. The only thing keeping me from giving it 5 stars is there are way too many ads. It will randomly make you watch a video to upgrade your ride or character, and/or to play a level. There's been a few times where I had enough tickets to play, and coins to upgrade my character the two points recommended, and I had to watch a video for all three. Three ads before you can even play a level is ridiculous. I understand that it's a big part of making money for the developers, but I've never had a free game with this many ads. Get rid of some of the ads and I'll gladly update my review to 5 stars.",

Of course, I suppose that's by design so I spend money. Which I won't do. I just want some \"bubblegum\" to past the time.  Now, it's making my blood pressure rise...  Also amazing how many 5 ‚≠ê ratings they get in one day without the user giving explanations on why. Seems suspicious...  Oh, how I hate the legends arena stages...",

Would help keep players more interested. My only dislikes so far. I most definitely enjoy the game and think it's pretty awesome!",
        "Best game period. Not just golf or sports game, but any game. Wouldn't change a thing. All ya all who say, oh they need to change this or that, and why do I have to play someone who's better than me? Well it's because you suck, and you have no hand eye coordination. Just shut up and dribb, uh I mean play. #1 game for a reason peeps. Love ya. Dueces. Peace biatches.",
        "First of all I love the game, I play every day. I especially love the tournaments. But now I have to congratulate you guys, you are brilliant. You took a push one button to go between guest and Facebook accounts, and changed it to pushing 20 buttons. And now you have to leave the game and go to the Facebook app to push most of them. Apparently you're not happy about two accounts. I don't know why, I spend twice as much money.  Tech monkeys, gotta love 'em.",
        "This was on four stars, but keeps crashing and asks for at least one Facebook login every time it starts. It should know that I'm already logged in!  Since the last update it crashes constantly, losing me money (around 100k now). Even when it does reconnect, it frequently gives me too little time to set up a shot.",
        "It's cool but everyone seems to be fairly good so all matches come down to a shoot out. Meh. And in the shootouts your opponent can see ur shot if u go first. Meh. All kinds of perks for FB. I don't have FB. Meh. Have to spend $$ to get decent clubs and balls or play this 24/7 and I won't do either lol. Nice try tho playdemic. Cheers.",
        "Just downgraded from a 3.  I just played a game were the other  player hit the ball out of bounds and wasn't given a penalty, then hit a miracle shot from over 100 yards away to beat  me.  I immediately uninstalled after that.  Was a decent game but the devs need to make some major changes."

I am totally enthusiastic about purchasing the premium version, however, I could not buy it because I do not have any credit or debit card. Can someone please tell me if there is other ways to purchase, like deducting the fee directly from my SIM balance, perhaps?",
        "Smash Hit Smash hit is awesome because it has a lot of intensity in the game so I get to let my brain work a little.  It kinda let your brain decide if your should hit it or not. I also really like this game because the game is kinda hard so it challenges me a little bit. So who ever made this game I appreciate it. One more thing about Smash Hit is that it brings my family together because we take turns playing the game to let our brain think. Thank You!",
        "BEST GAME EVER... Love this game,  a must have on every phone.. Well worth the price, amazing graphics.. Also bought the VR version truly unbelievable. Just 1 wee problem... When you reach infinity there is not a lot of glass to smash for extra balls which is a must have especially when it goes super fast.  Thankyou and keep up the great work..",
        "Spectacular Shockingly Good Game This game is addicting and amazing who thought breaking glass could be so fun. I mean somebody thought of something random when they made this. I I love it it is just so amazing. If only the person who thought of it made the game so that you didn't have to pay for some stuff like extra levels. Still if you're reading this and you're questioning if you should download this or not you definitely should.! üòâüòÄ‚ò∫",
        "Excellent game. Really superb game. Engaging play and the music works well. Plus fantastic breaking sounds. This game is both addictive and relaxing. Reminds me of the original wipeout. Another cool element is that each level adds interesting new elements. Only thing that would make it better is if my acheivements would track. Im on a galaxy s 7, and they don't track. At least my checkpoints save.",
        "One of my fav time killers! I can play this game for long periods at a time without getting tired of it. Zen mode is great but the whole premise of the game is a stress relieving, fun, \"get to break stuff\" good time.  Highly recommended.   Also play on my ten inch tablet and it's a little easier to be accurate with such a big screen."

        "This is actually a really good game. And while I would refer a flat fee to buy it without ads even the ads aren't that bad. Yes there are ads but the game is free and even the \"microtransactions\" are so minor and the currency so easily obtained in game I can easily overlook the ads. Some have called it a Mario clone but in a way aren't most platformers but unlike so many of them this is actually very creative and well done. Excellent job!!",
        "A great Mario Clone.... Very close gameplay to the original. I love playing the game and have got very far through the levels but even tho I was signed in with Google account I lost my game progress after having to reset my phone. Am I missing something? Is there a way to get my progress back?",
        "Really good game only reason I gave it 4* is because when the the toads or snails are close... they seem to be 1 - 2 steps away and you still either die or shrink into small Mario... other than that little glitch it seems really good.",
        "Great game, my children 7 & 4 love playing it.... when they get a chance hahaüòÅ One thing I have noticed is you need to fix up the 111st to 111th after defeating the Boss! There is no st in 111",
        "Love this app . Actually I install this app in my previous mobile but my bad luck I lost it.and in My pre.mobile I  reach 125 level .i became so sad that I will not able to play my sboy adventure game and next day I just buy new phone. first app that I install in phone is this appüåüüåüüåüu deserves 1000000000000stars.",
        "I finished all 140 parts, the more higher the more challenging. It always made me curious about this. Wait for d next part 2,3,etc from SWorld Boy Adventures. Just need fixed for controls the pictures doesn't\u200b moved while we repeat at the same level that We failed. Overall for me it's good game's."

And you could add mustard and mayonnaise. Wait Maybe you could make tacos and weird ones. These are just  suggestions but I would love to see some of these suggestions. You would call it Toca Kitchen 3, with a nice logo. I did like toca kitchen 1 & 2. It is fun to play and food, and when we mess up to see how the people eating the food react. Bye.",
        "I'm giving a 5 star rating, not cuz I like this game but because I want you to make all your games free or at least the toca life:city or vacation. Please I always wanted that game because It looks really fun and it must be. You probably won't make them free but if you can, make toca life city free at least",

Once I gave the girl a drink that had water,and all the spices and all of that, and she was like, the funniest reaction!üòÜüòÜ I also like how  there are different cooking supplies and spices and utensils!

        "I LOVE this app! And I'm so glad it's free! Everyone is like 'it's the same thing over and over again' but they're not actually getting into this game. They're are tons of different options to choose from and like Toca Boca says cook it your way. I LOVE TOCA BOCA!!!",
        "This is the best game ever it is also funny because I was giving the girl food and I gave her some strawberries and I put a lot of lemon, hot sauce, Barbiecu sauce,Manas,keckup,salt, and pepper... SO funny, it also sounds just like a kid is playing with the food, that I'm eating grapes right now,üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÅüòÄüòä‚ò∫üôÇüòê"

        "I've been on Township since 2015 and I absolutely love it. Its the first game I play in the morning and the last one I play at night. This game has so much personality. From the characters to the animals, it is by far the best game that I've played so far. Keeps me busy for hours and I recently got my boyfriend hooked, keeps him as busy as it does myself. I don't have any complaints about it. Thank you GPG for coming up with a game so super fantastic. Kudos to the developers.",
        "This game needs the ability to gain more township cash. I have spent way too much real money to buy township cash and im not doing so again at this rate. Farmville isnt this bad and hard to expand.  You cant expand the barn without waiting on products by train or paying in township cash to expand. And that costs over a couple hundred township cash for each expansion. Getting a dollar or two here and there takes forever to collect. Plus the expansion makes small expansions so it doesnt help much.   If something dont change i may quit the game. I enjoy it and would like to continue but at this rate i dont see much point. I cant afford to pay more money to play.",
        "The Best!  But not Great my suggestion is please add an option to chat your friends privately this is important!.  Also add an option to search anyone by their township name so we can easily adding them.. Last one add an option to change your profiles photo from our gallery if you can~ instead of using our Facebook photos or township original photos.. Please make it happen",
        "Great game very addictive, and I don't know if I just found the right Co-op or what but the team work on this game is amazing. I love my little town although, üòí you need to be able to expand faster! I have NO ROOM for any more buildings, and they want me to expand my population so I can add more buildings. Thats's kind of ridiculous. That's the only bad thing I have to say about this game.",
        "BEST GAME EVER! It's my biggest game but even though I have an old phone the game still runs really smoothly. There's always something to do, it never gets boring. I've been playing for 8 months. Super easy to use and learn. It's addictive. You also don't feel pressured to make purchases like other games.",
        "Actually, I love this game.. I've signed in for over 60 days, and my whole family plays. The reason for the poor rating is because every time it freezes, I lose all my T-cash. This is the 3rd time it happened, and I can't find a way to contact. And, yes, I restarted my phone, restarted the game, and my settings are correct. Fix this and give me back my cash, and I will happily change my rating. This last one was 19 T-cash, but I have lost more, and enough is enough!"

It sucks that they ruined this app, looking at the iOS version its obvious they haven't bothered to update this in years.",
        "Overall, the game is OK . But there is a few issues. My bike tips back and I can't stop it from tipping back until I die. But this doesn't happen all the time. It happens about every five weeks. Also, I was given a 5$ gift card and a 10$ gift card but I can't buy any of the bikes.",
        "It's a fun little game at first, but has many, many flaws. You have to link it to your Facebook account if you wanna play all maps. There are way too many ads, they force you to buy their bikes which are ridiculously overpriced and overpowered, so you can't play multiplayer because people who bought those bikes will always beat you. That's just ridiculous. Not to mention it's very buggy. Sometimes you're racing someone who's in a completely different track than you. It used to be fun, now it's just stupid.",

It says it failed because I would not allow them access to my friends list. Something doesn't seem right about that. Never had a game NOT allow me to login, after denying access to my friends list. Sorry, would prefer you not send messages to all my friends with my name tagged on it.",
        "As football based game it is superb, in terms of gameplay, graphics etc. But the biggest idiotic part of this game is that if freezes like magic. The whole game main screen becomes unresponsive and stays like that no matters the game is restarted or the damn phone is. Get this thing sorted out Miniclip. You have a reputation to maintain or not?",
        "I think this game is a really fun addicting game. The main reason why I got it was because of 8 ball pool. That game is also very fun. The only thing I don't like about football strike is that when I get on sometimes it won't let me click the spinner. So it's like my phone froze. But my phone didn't freeze. It's just the app. So can you guys please fix this.",
        "At first I was skeptical about this game. I had downloaded it and went without playing for a couple of weeks. Then,one day I just happen to open the app and play. Best move I ever made for an app! This game is just flat out addicting, fun and challenging.  I was pleasantly surprised about how much fun it is and that there is, most of the time, something new.  Chalkenign friends and new people always makes for a challenging and fun time waster. Even if I don't have the time to play, I still make time!! Haha",
        "There is a bug in your game I went first of my league, supposingly I am entitled to 350 cash, but it wasn't there.  How could you make it so unfair for someone. Why bother having a prizes if not given to the right person.",
        "I am in love with this game.. But the only bad thing happened today and I'm very disappointed. I won carnival cup so I should get the announced price which includes 2 VIP  cards also. I didn't get my prize and I'm really very upset. I have a screenshot of winning cup also.. I hope miniclip will help me. I'm expecting my prize from you. I really love this game."

Its impossible to complete 1 level and we are forced to watch an ad even if we don't want to. Remember, you get your money from us. So u better see this!",
        "I love this game I am playing this non stop. Maybe you can change a couple of things like ,I don't understand that there's a button after you have died on a level there is a skip level button but how do we earn that. But I love this game hopefully it will roll into 2018!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",
        "It's a simple game to learn. However, since the most recent update, I've used the snail buff on accident a lot. It limits the time I spend playing this game now."

Your character jumps higher, flips and twirls faster as U advance further. I play it once or twice a day at least. All in All a great/fun app....ENJOY !!",
        "Ads ads and more ads. And really pushy ads that you can't just close straight away too. You spend more time watching ads than playing the game, and honestly you can't advance in the game without watching ads for coins anyway, so it's basically an advertisement with a mini game in between. Scummy sell out app.",
        "Love this game, its an addictive time killer. But I would like to have replays and not sure if it's only my device because I haven't seen other reviews about it but it doesn't have an accurate count of flips, my friend counted 11 and it said 3.5 I do many more (yes at one time, before landing) and it still says 3, 3.5, 4",
        "Since the last update, being able to double up on coins from hourly balloons is impossible.  Also watching videos for coins isn't working.  This game is great when everything works right.  However, it is getting frustrating not being able to view videos for coins.  I'm game ad breaks are still working, so what's the deal?  The # 1 thing that keeps me in a game is not having to spend real money.  I a star simply because of this.  Fix it please.",
        "In this game once you have all of the flips it gets really boring. Also there are way to many ad breaks. This game was really fun but now that it's newer it's boring. It lags to much and kicks me out. I give this 1 star",
        "No matter how hard I tried, I would end up crashing on my head.  Round would end, and it would ask if you wish too see an ad.  Expect that after every round. Even if you say no, it will do an ad break every 3 rounds.  I wanted to enjoy this game, but it was not challenging, and so many ads that I uninstalled it."

I have played many coco games, (almost all of them) but this one is the bestest of them all (if that's a word üòú) mainly because A LOT is unlocked including the SPA!!! (Crazy, right?!?!?!) and there are so many things to do. Plus it also reminds me of subway surfers..... The one thing I love besides the spa, is the restaurant. As far as I know, only fitness girl has that..... So definetly, it's a plus..... üëåüëåüëåüëåüëåüëçüëçüëçüëçüëçüòã",

        "3 stars because the spins are not giving what is needed for the game. It's a cute game. I enjoy playing with my daughter. However, shields do not spin enough. Sometimes I will go a whole day with no shields and the whole time I'm getting attacked. The other thing is the bonus spin. Never have I won more that 250k coins. I know you want us to pay for another spin but maybe award a higher number once in a while. All in all cute game.",
        "Game is pretty cool but I won't spend money because what you get for your money is not worth it. They raise the prices of the chest to get cards and it's already hard to get the coins to build villages, get raided and attacked so much it takes months to get to the next villages. I hope y'all up the amount of coins on spins because it doesn't go up much at all but the cost of everything else shoots up like crazy.",
        "This game was fun initially. But as you rank up, you gain coins and then before you get to even use them, someone is able to steal them from you (by random spinning.. no planned attack!!)   If you play this game,DO NOT SPEND MONEY TO BUY SPINS. People can steal your earnings... so you basically pay actual money, to give others coins...",
        "Every time i get burn village within 1 HR ....and not get anything good point... See my point 382 and village7lvl.  ..but totally bad  to see others  points is totally low like 188 and her village 9lvl am totally disappointed on this game.... So I No need to play any more....",
        "I've been stuck on the 2nd village for 2 months! How is that even possible I should of been completed it but somehow I never have enough coins or so many people damage my village that I have to keep fixing it7 used to love the game but not anymore!!",
        "I need help so I spent $10 in order to get to the next level which I did where I could get my daily spin and hit jackpot and it gave me my fox but I closed the app and it took me backwards to the last level even though I already built in my new level. Please help and put me back to the level ahead of me as this is very upsetting for spending money and being right back where I was before. Fix it and I'll give it 5 stars for everything thank you"

        "lnstaII 'VEARN' App Enterr (CRETA) to Start Earning So far so good.Fun way to get money. Won't make you rich but the extra cash is helpful. It's also the best exchange rate on points. McEarn points equals mc instead of like some of the others where it takes VEarn points to reach vc etc...Also, lnstaII 'TOYOCASH' App Enterr (TRDG) very reliable in paying you when you redeem to toyocash. You can choose assorted giftcards as payment or transfer to Walet for cash. Your choice. I love these guys thanks for addingsome fun to my day.",
        "I love the game play and graphics. But I payed for adidas female clothing and an aquarium previously on the game, and then when I restarted, they have gone. I spend ¬£3 on it in total and I actually spent more money on other things that didn't come back in the next game, but it's understandable because they were lifestyle points and you know it's currency not clothing or furniture. I uninstall sims sometimes a bit of always go back and before my items were there, but now they're not and that really frustrated me. I actually ended up in 2017 spending  ¬£10 on sims freeplay and that's the only money I think I will ever spend on ot now because if you restart,  you don't get anything you wanted. Please fix this because I spent that money and I could've bought something else with it but I didn't because I like sims.",
        "First, I don't like that the game is in realtime it makes it a lot less fun and more boring. Secondly, I don't like that you HAVE to buy things just to get vip. I know that the prices are quite low but if you're just a kid like me then that limits what you can do. Lastly, I want more jobs and maybe even school to be playable it would just seem reasonable and make the game more addicting. Overall the game is really enjoyable but could do better, still keep up the good work!",
        "I like everything about this game no questions asked but i do find a few things annoying the main one is selling items in you inventory 1 at a time i wish there was a sell all for an item that would make this less annoying  to sell after house building and such. Please add a sell all oh and when do you think you can make more quests i really like doing them.",
        "For the fact that we can't sell multiple items at once is a big downer. I have accumulated so many windows, computers, chairs etc with watching the daily news ads and it's a complete pain to delete 30, 50, 70 or even more! items one by one. Please consider adding this function in the app as it's in the real The Sims games.",
        "Overall,  this is a great game. Two requests.  1) Selling multiple items at once.  I bought a load of junk and I need to sell it!  2) Make the schools \"playable\",  like the police station. I was talking to my sister about this and it'd be cool if the schools were playable and you could build clubs inside it. Anyway,  I loved everything in the game! So fun,  so creative."

Wish there could a 5 second skip button like YouTube does, especially you guys advertise every time after you die/end a game.  The graphics are cool, love the neon colors. It's a game for all ages!!! My kids and my husband and I all play this game. It's very competitive!!! I swear my husband can't beat my score no one has lol",
        "It's good but not what I would play on daily basis..... it's my opinion so don't get mad. The controls are OKAY and I think they add more stuff to the game, I don't have any ideas for it though. This game is great and in the people like it but for me I wouldn't play it all the time on a road trip. Keep up the good work though! üòÄüòÄüòÄ",
        "It is soooooo addictive and also VERY awesome. The only problem is that because people go on the game on their phone's or tablets I find it hard to control I don't know if anyone else thinks so but that's my opinion. Pls no hate anyway, Peace out and the reason it is like slither.io is bc it is by the same company",
        "Great game can be addictive with no real goal but to eat others poop as me and my daughter call it and other worms to grow bigger. Top notch comical game EVER that you wont be able to stop. Only set back is that the game gets extremely extremelylaggy on addroid tablets and on the online game interface",
        "A very addictive game that's great fun! The only problem is with the controls. It seems to go too fast without even hitting the speed button (if you have played it you will know what I mean). IMO the speed function is uneccesary, take it out of the game and it's 5 stars all the way!",
        "Great game however I wish there was a way to avoid the button that makes you speed up suddenly.  This us partially because you use your fingers to maneuver it and your fingers can get in the way of your view of the screen. It could cause you to kind if lose control of your worm."

Just one minor complaint though,  the controls are supposed to be hard, yes,  and they are,  in a fun way, but the rotating hand control joystick seems to be inverted somehow,  could you possibly fix the rotating controls a bit,  it really throughs me off being it seems like one of the the Y axis is inverted, but not the X axis? Correct me if I'm wrong but I think that's the problem. Maybe add settings? Love the game,  and I've been playing it for a while,  nice job.",

        "WTH HAS HAPPENED?? Been playing for 3+ years and have NOT EVER seen the game \"rolling\" system so broken. I have not rolled anything worth a $$@ in almost 3 MONTHS. Don't give me the it's random thing. I have never had anything like this until after an update a couple months back. You have obviously changed the system and it is apparently to screw the long timers in favor of generating more $$ but it's only making long timers like me BORED and frustrated!! I'm not spending any more money until it's fixed. Tired of wasting cash!",
        "I've been playing for almost 4 years and CC used to be better before you could purchase top level heroes. IGG really sucked what little competitive nature was left in the game out with pay to win. If you want to spend money on a game and still be competitive, play Summoners War instead.",
        "What stands out the most from other games of this type for me is that you get heroes and that you don't lose fighters in battle unless they die whereas in other games like clash of clans you lose all you fight with regardless. Plus it's just an incredibly addictive game that you can do well with even if you don't spend any money.",
        "Some people use this for a dating app or say innapropiate things and kids play this game obviously. But that isnt the games fault its the players fault. However i would like it if the creators would sensor all of that",
        "OMG This app is annoying in all ways... And on Certain hack things I play this for 30 seconds but still don't get a pass! Tell CoTops to give me my credits",
        "Lol I'm changing my review once more. I love the game but every new hero you guys drop completely messes up the game and makes things unfair. I don't know if your way of trying to fix it is by making more OP heroes but it simply makes the game less enjoyable. The last few heroes that came out completely made my account useless and if I don't put in a good couple hundred dollars is just gonna stay useless. I think that's unfair so for now I'm taking off a few stars. I know you guys don't care but its the only thing I can do to express my opinion. In my humble opinion you guys should balance the useless heroes you already have rather than coming up with new ones that make the old ones  useless."

Also when I went to the supermarket in goat simulator I found lays, Doritos and Oreos..can u imagine??!!!?!?!? Then I hit a girl and a boy with a gas car but they didn't die??!!! and that's a little bit creepy and weird.

        "This game keeps crashing to the home screen without warning,same problem with Blossom blast saga.Problem started before few days ago,since I updated both games.This problem keeps happening with android kitkat. Can this problem be solved or should I deinstall all king games I have? I have no problem with games from other developers, so this is on you, not on me.",
        "Since today I've started getting in game app adverts...  Terrible considering it only says in app purchases. What a joke a bit like the stupid pig you gave us for gold bars which you made out to be free but no... Of course you have to purchase so why put that rubbish in the game! If I wanted to check if I have PPI I'd wait for a cold caller, not an in game advert! You take the living p*ss!",
        "Fun & super adorable match 3 game - the only game I've kept playing for years (3-4?!) Variety of different mechanics and choice of animal helpers keep it interesting, and less frustrating than the Candy Crush games. Then again, maybe it's just because everything is so darn cute! So nice to see the New Zealand birds/animals in there too, go kiwi! :)",

        "The game is fun and can be addictive.  It is a great app that helps me tune things out in a busy/stressful environment and  keep calm."

I know I logged in yesterday and didn't miss a day. I also was moved down a bubble level. Updates should not make you lose everything you've earned.",
        "I have completed level 705 but game won't let me move on to next level...keeps saying I'm offline! I'm connected online but nothing I do will let me move on to the next episode. Please KING fix this problem!  UPDATE as of 21st February: the message \"go online for more episodes\" is still showing everytime I try and play. So still not fixed in the new update! PLEASE FIX!!",
        "DO NOT SPEND MONEY ON THIS APP.  I still CAN NOT OPEN the app. 6 days and 11 emails later I still do not have a refund. DO NOT SPEND MONEY ON THIS APP. Several times when I have spent money the app takes it and then shuts down. Currently I spent $14.99 and have over 6 hours of playing time. It's been 6 DAYS now and the app will not reopen. It's not the first time this has happened. It will get no more of my money.",
        "Its not letting me retrieve my 2hr free play anymore. It has skiped at least 5 free plays over the last few weeks. As well as it robs me of my free boosters from time to time. What is going on? The commercials keep getting stuck, and when they do o lose out on my booster I was supposed to get from watching the ads. Pls fix  Thanks",
        "I will give it the 5 stars when i get all my levels back. It says I need internet to download new episodes, and I clearly have full signal. Also it bumped me down to like level 700 when I'm on over 1500. Fix ASAP or I will be deleting for good",
        "This why I do not purchase boosters and such.  It's has RIDICULOUS levels, stuck at  429/ HARD! It is too hard, it has impossible levels that  you, only pass at, when the oligarch King, wishes u 2, its stingy for the amount of tries on hard level, how about 45 tries instead? Want five üé¨üé•üëëüáªüá≥'s fa get about it, lets play fair. I tried CCS it was unbeatable, uninstalled, pet rescue next to go."

        "Overall the game itself is pretty good and worth the download for a good couple hours of fun even with a few friends. However I would highly recommend not spending any money on the in game purchases. I got ripped off, luckily with in game currency only and the \"game team\" is adamant that nothing went wrong. If that is the type of support they give I wouldn't want something to go wrong with my actual money. So long story short as long as u don't spend money u should have a good time playing",
        "I give 1star not because that game isn't game is awesome I give 1 star because of support team. I tried many time to contact them to short out my problem but they don't reply. My problem is my trophy points are above 1500 but I always find a enemy with 900 points and it takes more than 1minute to find a enemy please guys tell me what do I do it is so frustrating I can't take it anymore",
        "This had already been done much better. This game allows you to play about 30 minutes before you need to shell out money to compete. Not interested in these crooked games. When are we going to get back to some honesty and not trying to screw customers to get rich?",
        "It's awesome game with wonderful grafics. First I thought it's an exact copy of clash of Royale but when I started to play this game I thought that clash of Royale is a worst game. My suggestion is don't waste your 94mb while downloading clash of Royale better use 94mb +2mb =96mb for downloading this miracle and a wonderful game Castle Crush.üè∞üè∞üèØüèØüè∞üè∞üèØüèØ",
        "Love the game defiantly 5* just a couple of comments I hope get read it would be nice to gain some coins through friendly battles with people in your clan. Also if you could see when your group member's were last active it would be easier to sort out our clans. Thanks",
        "Pay to play, unplayable if you don't pay. Got to level three and could no longer match against anyone lower than level 8 so I never had a chance."

        "Game is fun until you get so far and can no longer upgrade to compete.  I have all stars in amateur league, yet on achievement rewards it shows I only have 1 star.  This is a problem to try to earn stars to purchase higher end cars, you can't without spending money.  Should be anle to earn all cars if you play regularly withput spending money.",
        "First up the images used as what the game looks like are fakes. I saw too many polygons.... (Shudder) Secondly there is no start menu. NOPE! Just some fancy loading screen and boom you're in the game without a chance to look at the controls. Plus your first mission is ruined by the tutorial at the worst places on the track.   Bad game knockoff. If you download this just delete it. This game is [EXPLICATIVE]",
        "Good time waster. Especially well made in the beginning levels, but quickly becomes pay to win, as diamonds are not easily attainable and neither are coins, not to mention that later cars are very high prices and require much dedication to acquire. Controls are nice, but like with money, get worse with time. Maps are not optimized for later leveled cars, making some corners physically impossible to make even when drifting at full tilt, forcing the player to adapt to a combination of drifting, boosting and then braking to get around a bend without crashing. Otherwise, it is a very nice game for being free, although there are many ads, but that's excusable as it is a free game. I would recommend it, just not as a long term type of game.",
        "Nice game at first, my gf got angry at some point because I played it the whole time. However, I soon started playing less and less, because winning just became impossible. I respect the developers, but I wont pay to max out a cars modifications just to race that same car which is twice as fast. How does that work? Are the AI cars getting modifications from a different game?",
        "Update: so I've been playing for several weeks now. You cannot win with maxed out mods, racing the same level cars. They're twice as fast and you can only knock off 3 cars at the beginning of the race and you're unable to catch with others. Even if you spend money, you will not get 1st place in a lot of the races. Very unbalanced game. Whoever programmed the ai should be fired  Fun game, but the intrusive ads are ridiculous. It pops up in the middle of a race, before and after the race, finished off by asking you to pay to remove ads.",
        "I don't know what the game is even like. I couldn't even get past the loading part because it won't let me tap on the screen.  I find this very irritating because I like trying out new car games. But please promise me you won't play this game any further as its a waste of your time."

        "I really liked this game when it had only 20 seasons & I uninstalled it after finishing. I again installed it and started from the beginning and after completing 573 games & 1487 stars I am giving you just 2star rating because game lag all the time sometimes the ads got struck or maybe during rewind I lose my $1 but the game didn't rewind back instead crash and auto shutdown and I ahve to start the application again. Before adding 30th season please update your games stability it will be more useful.",
        "Surprised at how good this game is... very clever concept and I'm only half an hour into it and I'm already hooked! Recommend it to anyone who's a fan of football, well in fact, anyone who's a fan of gaming in general... well worth checking out, chuffed I came across it. 5***** for all features from me. The developers really did a fine job. Get it now is my advice! Peace out people :)",
        "Like most other games, there is too much effort to bait you into micro transactions. The older games were so much better. It's a shame the Devs have resorted to such money grabbing standards.",
        "I like the tactic aspect of it, pretty good time waster. Took me a while to beat it, but didn't have to spend a dollar to do it. The story itself is very unrealistic and after 15 seasons I completely stopped following it and focused only on the games.",
        "There should be a full match game like this that isn't scripted. I love it! Should be an energy free mode maybe? As its a bit pay to win\\microtransaction heavy.  They've made some changes, if you like ads and Facebook popping up after everything you do, then this is the game for you, dropped my rating 1 star as a result.  Also took out the ability to watch adverts for in game currency, now you have to pay. Even more of a cash grab now.",
        "The defensive players are always faster to the ball than the offense. If you mess up during a game you have to go all the way back (unless u pay money for their in game credit). Half the time it sets you up with a shot that there is now way you can score or pass successfully."

        "Its world best game ever played.  It is like a small GTA of phone or for android. It doesn't look too good but if u download and play it will like a real GTA. It is a quite big but the game is super amazing. It is not too interesting in starting but later u can play it like a GTA. It also not need any extra files to download after downloading from play store but it needs Internet connection.",
        "Sir i have some problems. My suits has low DPS from my other friends I upgrade all skills but nothing happend. My osteo x mediam lvl.1 has 840DPS and i compare my friends they has more DPS.  When i up on the small vehicle with my  Monster Truck(heavy vehicle)  the small vehicles can't wreak. Plzzzzz do something for me. It's a request. My problems are not solved.",
        "This game might not look so good when you download it, but there is a lot you can do. Buy properties to get money, buy guns armor, cars. There are plenty of minigames and quick play missions like street races, survival, and parachuting. The storyline may only be decent, but the missions are still fun.  The only real problem is the file size. You have to dedicate too much of your storage, if you have a newer phone with more built in storage, or a microSD card, you should try this game.",
        "Please reduce the cost of things on store and do something in your next update so that the player can get more and more diamonds from the hit list. Please reduce the cost of jet pack.  And when I watch videos for reward, it doesn't work. I have watched over a hundred videos but it's only two times that I got a reward.",
        "Honesty its just like GTA which a great thing but the thing is the installation time let me share my experience to one and all reading hear... When I was downloading it at the first its done but it starts downloading once again but I am not sure is it my problem but I just wanted to share with you guys... The game is boss",
        "Best game I've ever played! In fact it is the only game I've had on my phone for 2 years. But there are some minor errors that keep occurring, such as when you are running or driving any vehicle, the control pad keeps stopping and I have to lift my thumb up and put it back down to regain control. Now I know it doesn't sound like much, it can mess up your drifts and the gas will stop as well. PLEASE FIX. Thanks"

        "Great game, Love it! Very creative, fantastic graphics. Not so difficult or loss of life's to where you can't even play.  Yet still challenging.  Only negative is lots of ads. Would gladly pay nominal fee to get rid of them.",
        "I hate the fact that one can't enjoy the game. So many advertising ads keep popping up one right after the other. Interrupting you while your playing the game. It's so annoying & fusterating. The game itself is Awesome but with all these stupid ads in the way. One gets feedup.",
        "Love it !!! Caught my eye when I saw \"pick 2\" vs. pick 3. I'm a stay at home mom kids in school 6 days week that gives me time to burn   (lol) They did a couple small tweeks which  made the \"typical pick 3 concept\"a thing of the past (FINALLY) BUT WAS ENOUGH change to make it a keeper",
        "Not a clue if there's a story line, how the power ups work, the difference between the levels or what the deal with the chest is BUT it a cute fun game to pass the time with and relax with. It's challenging but I've yet to get completely and frustratingly stuck. This feels like a game designed for fun not to make money though \"buying lives\"",
        "This is a rip off of toy blast!  Peak Games went after hashbro MLP Puzzle party for ripping off the gameplay of toy blast by peak games. I am pissed off that they went after hashbro but not other knock offs. I liked MLP Puzzle Party this game is so boring. Not only they ripped off peak games they ripped off the music from Genies and Gems from Jam City. I will uninstall!"

        "Several times now I've tried to type in a logo name and the app has told me I got it wrong but I thought it was right and couldn't see why I was being told I was wrong. So I hit \"solve\" and the answer is exactly what I typed in.  I have also had a few times now where I've recognised the logo but there are letters missing when I try to type in the name.  I had what I suspect to be this app deferral years ago and had no problems with it at all but since this new look and expanded number of logos has appeared it feels like you've ruined a fun app. Any chance of fixing this screw up?",
        "Several times I have tried to use a hint and it  wouldn't take it off and it was difficult and easy. When I type in the logo it would tell me I'm wrong then I hit solve and it was the same thing I wrote also and if people don't know some of the logos what is the point of the game.",
        "Love testing my knowledge but I recommend a change. Upon entering the last letter you should have the option to view before the answer is submitted. My big fingers cause me to select the incorrect letter occasionally and then I get the wrong answer and my streak is reset. Please correct this.",
        "It's too easy to amass a huge number of hints and use them. I'd like not to be able to complete every level without doing some online searches.",
        "My 6 year old son is really enjoying doing this with me! Just a little frustrating with the American logos that we're not so sure on!",
        "This app is nice. One thing I like about this app is it takes only one single unit to give a random letter hint because I have seen in many apps that they take 60 or 90 coins or whatever unit to just show a letter and this app haves daily bonus 30 coins so I love this app but I think that the app members should give a little attention on the animation because it is not so clear. Besides this all all the best for the team of this app and make good apps further."

        "It's very good, indeed! The questions are truly endless, which is veru  refreshing (literally), although some questions are a bit too scientific for me, but I can't blame the game for my lack of knowledge in this specific field. However, I can even it out because most of the scientific terms are basically in Greek, so I unerstand what most of them mean and answer a few science questions correctly. Apart from that, there is history, geography, grammar and spelling, politics, art, the pop culture in general. Being Greek, I feared that the majority of questions would have to do with USA stuff, like most of the other quizes, but it's not. This game asks questions about things that are taking or have taken place all around the world and sometimes the correct answer demands very specific knowledge. It's a great quiz!",
        "It's OK but not general knowledge unless you're a historian. Also if your stuck pick answer 2 and you'll be right 65% of the time! I see your response and no, I stand by my answer, if you guess and pick 2 you will be right way more than you are wrong. Answer 2 comes up way more than any other answer, sometime 3 times in a row.

        "It's okay and the graphics are really nice, the sound effects are good but ultimately, you play and play and play and play and still not got to the other towns. I've got to about the 7th and had enough of trying to get further and not progressing much. It's okay for a few days but after that, and like someone else has mentioned about the ads, too many to get little rewards",
        "Really fun and adictingl but for samsung galaxy core prime this game has A LOT of bugs and glitches. Tried to play for more than five minutes is making the phone first freeze the screen then restart itself. Some cabs never arrive. Need a lot of bugfixes right now. Other than that it is a good game that i like.",
        "For a game so heavily reliant on ads to deliver benefits to the player, it is a gamble sometimes whether or not those ads will crash the game and therefore cost you the prizes. The game itself is all right, but this gamble drags down the experience when it doesn't work.",
        "It's like owning your own transportation service like Uber or Lyft, but in arcade Crazy Taxi meets Monopoly. If you hire drivers to your service, you not only make more money, but you expand your  territory. I love the diversity of the characters, how you have new with the classic arcade characters like Axel, Gus and Gena. And I also love the concept is modern, but has the classic arcade concept and feel with the scratch cards, gems, and money. Bonuses are earned through accomplishing objectives, and of course, ads. Thanks Sega. üëåüëç‚ù§",
        "Outstanding game. My only fuss is cars get trapped in some buildings during attempts to retrieve funds. Going back to another stage and returning to the stage I'm engaged in usually resets game play. Otherwise, great game.",
        "It's a chilled game to play. There are a bit too many ads. And it because it is just tapping, it can be a bit boring after a while. It takes long before you get somewhere new. But all by all it's a free easy game to kill time perfectly."

The only problem is that you need to be a certain level to buy something and how there's only boots and helmets, and no chest plates or leggings, but when I first played it I was shocked to find 2 problems in an amazing app! 5 stars everything! Also, you should make huge, amazing looking, almost impossible bosses that will make me flip my table when I can't beat them! Keep making more awesome games!",
        "This game would be perfect if the controls were better. They are nonsense. Doesn't always shoot when I tap, jumping is crazy, and the game gives you multiple ways to control, but they are all garbage. Also would have appreciated a tutorial so I knew what I was doing",
        "I'm really loving this game it's simple but still a ton of fun. My one complaint would be the sometimes the grind is too long and I almost gave up... I wish the developers would throw in some kind of experience boost in the store instead of just being able to buy coins. I would pay real money for an exp boost and would love to support the Developers! just give me the chance!",
        "I can't help but love a mobile game that doesn't constantly shove advertisements in your face. No silly energy system to make you wait to play, and while it has a real money store, it's tucked away in a corner where it belongs. Different control options and simple, accessible gameplay make this a hidden gem. 5 stars all the way. Kudos to the developer.",
        "I really like the game. But there's one thing that annoys me: when I don't play this game for a few hours and then I do another battle in dungeon, the game crashes after killing last monster in that battle.  I found out that if I switch on mobile data it works. So I wanted to asked why is that. EDIT: now all works just fine. 5 stars",
        "Told me to r8 5 stars so I did. Jk it's good, very entertaining. Controls are a bit off, but that's true for most mobile twin stick mobile shooters because of the small screen. Overall fun game"

Unplayable shots where one number on power scale is to hard the next one down is to soft.  Multi player has a feel of being rigged at times.  Potential for a good game but not yet in my books.",
        "Used to be so much better. Cameras are now not fluid, it doesn't show the hole prior to shot anymore. Truthfully, it was awesome before you made changes... It goes back to the old saying, \"why fix it if it isn't broken?\"",

        "Some observations: ball does not rebound off rails as they should, especially the back and side rails near the hole, where the ball hits the rail and stops dead. Part of miniature golf mastery is using the rails but not in this game. And when the ball is against a rail a shot is allowed as if the rail was not present. After a shot the screen should automatically rotate close to what the next shot would be expected so as to minimize manual rotation. I was making a long swipe to rotate almost 180¬∞ and my finger hit the power slide and an errant shot was made. Most hills are not smoothly sloped but instead very angular. Hitting the bottom of the slope causes the ball to jump in ways unanticipated rather than roll. This is golf, not basketball. I uninstalled the game because it just wasn't as fun and realistic as I had hoped.",
        "Awful controls, heavily focused on buying coins & watching ads just to play matches. Not recommended!"

The only down side is that the spins cost alot of coins and those coins can be hard to earn. So 4.5 stars i would rate it is that was a option but its not so i rate it a a big fat 5",

This game all in all soooooooo fun and you should totally get it. just say no if you want to write a reaport on this game because it will ask you is this game is beautiful which it is not. GOOD LUCK, good  night, new york city. at late night talk show with stephen colebert......jk",
        "Would rate give starts, but the amount of ads is absolutely ridiculous. I'm actually thinking about uninstalling please fix that. I know you want players to pay but in all actuality, it's quite stupid. Anyway, I do believe the game is quite fun",
        "Whatever they did last update broke the game for me, this is why I never buy anything in these games. No way to contact anyone to resolve any problems.  Game gets boring anyway",
        "I love this game a lot. The only problem is that when you do the Dailey spin, you only get like coins. And then with the coins you can buy another spin which is what I do. And I get even more coins. It's really rare to get  locations or characters.    Please change that so we get Moore chances to get good prizes  But this is a very fun game and",
        "It's a really good game and works really well. The only thing I don't like is how the cost of the daily spin goes up every time. It is quite annoying. Other than that I really enjoy playing this game. Great job guysüòÄ"

I also think you should consider more international answers for questions that have a broader scope like  the one about Coca-Cola brands. All the ones available in my country were not recognized as answers. Great game !!!",
        "Great game, fun to play.  Only things I don't like are the fact there are so many ads and not just short ads long videos which is really annoying, and second and probable the biggest issue I found is that there is no single player option! I have to have like 10+ games going to enjoy playing if my partners arent online or play often. Would be much better if there was single player option",
        "Ads are too long and frequent but other than that, it's good.  It could do with more English stuff though. I have no idea what gym chains are in the U.S or discount stores or supermarkets for that matter but I do know England. Some rounds I can't take part in and end up losing the game because if it. Also, a lot of English synonyms aren't recognised either. I'd enjoy the game even more if I could relate to all of it.",

        "Fantastic RPG I've played despite any problems with it you report the issues that are on the game the Movga team are on it. The graphics are brilliant and the updates are even better. The battleships and details are amazing and even better when you're in battle. To all future fleet commanders download and enjoy plus I've been playing this for over a year or so now and it still is my go to game. So if you're new to Rpg try this one. All hands to battle station's.",
        "Movga not answer requests, game very expensive if you want to play and on the top of this you could not trust developers  because you are charged for items you did not get,graphic effects your eyes  and if you're longer playing you could asleep. All the time game crashes and stalls, Samsung galaxy S7 was locked several times. Game is developed for crazy profit  and normally you should pay to have fun  otherwise some one will but not you.",
        "The game seems to go through faze's some times good some times just ok. If you only speak english it can be very taxing, not to friendly at times. Has a very clicky higher archery . If you fall out with them you can have wasted all the money you put into the game.",
        "Great game. Kills time and unfortunately my battery too. Would be good to have a facility to tell you your battery strength (may be next to the clock?). One of the better RPG I have played and updates aren't obtrusive.",
        "Game would be better if was based on skills rather than how much money you can spend on it. They should remove prosperity as it is abused before legion battles or regional battles. The players with the deepest pockets win no skills required... I love the game but the model is wrong.",
        "The translator needs fixing,  it's ok but could be a lot better,diamonds keep vanishing and there are other issues in game I don't like, it seems some legiins have preferential treatment regarding tasks and rewards. Other issues with the chat keyboard freezing or not working properly."

        "DON'T INSTALL THIS GAME...it's just another money machine. I'd played this game for 4 month and the amount of money you have to spent to be able to level up your teams is endless. You will pay for an lootbox system and be sure...it's just a money machine with ridiculous prices...this is far away from free to play... The leveling management and so called game meta is simply stupid...\"Do you wanna lose a raid-match when your team is on 3000 and the other on 2200 points.\" ...ridiculous. Updates are just \"price enhancements\" and new modes which are only playable if you spent more money.",
        "I've played this game for quite some time now.  I've spent a good deal of money and have enjoyed it up until now.  The basic gameplay is fun but if you want to be competitive it is a must to spend money.  The most frustrating part though is spending money and getting nothing in return.  I've been waiting for mats for a couple five stars for months.  The problem is you're not rewarded for what you put in it is all about luck of the draw.  An unlucky person like myself could spend a lot and wait forever to see any benefit",
        "Out of everything a few hours in. Complex and stingy. Slow, tedious  progression. Very random luck on  gameboard with too few gems shown to have any matching strategy.  Relies on random matching of gems falling. Uninstalling.",
        "I just did 4x 10pulls and didnt get a single 5*. Seriously, that's just poor management. Last time I spend any money. Don't spend your cash, it wont be beneficial. I wish I coukd get a refund.",
        "Despite the balancing improvements the game particularly in Raids still needs lots of improvements since someone with 400 less power than you with characters in lower tiers can still completely kick your ass. Serious detriment to wanting to continue to play if no matter how you level them up you still lose.",
        "I changed the rating of this game. With the constant updating it starting to tweek out. And it's getting impossible to finish levels. It's like way to long and to much to level up heros. Being stuck in higher provinces for a month is ridiculous. And the constant raids of losing more trophies to lower heros is bull. It was a fun game, but it gets boring being stuck on one level for months."

        "I have a Xiaomi Redmi 4 mobile with 3 GB RAM, 1.4 GHz Octa Core. Still Game hangs, Speed enhanced with a jerk every time and then it dies. I have reset my mobile and reinstalled it but the problem still there. It's very annoying. Otherwise I love this game. It's very addictive.",
        "Love this game ..I am been hooked with this game since years .however wanted to highlight I am currently in Level 346 Residential area where the task is to use slides 5 times to go to next level. However I have played that level so many times and found that Residential area doesn't have slides ...is this a bug ? How do we overcome it",
        "I've played this game since it started. My grandkids used to play until the constant glitches and the hot trails. I just don't understand why your company can't keep the glitches out. My desire to keep playing is waning on a daily basis. *sigh* I don't know why I even waste my breath.",
        "The game used to be fun, but not anymore.  More than that, after i did a factory reset on my phone, I've reinstalled the game, but surprise... I couldn't sync the game to my Google account. All my progress in game was lost. All the money invested in this game was lost. I have sent them emails, tickets about it but no answer what so ever. The result is ---&gt; uninstall",
        "I like this game but there's so much cheating going on. It doesn't resister some of the moves you make or it's lagging and when you smash the minions they should fly away and not stick to the screen for ten seconds so you can't see what's coming next. Just stop cheating! Don't take 20hours to give the necessary tools when doing a double task in the jelly lab.",
        "Really cool. Its just  too WEIRD. And sometimes when I try to Dodge an obstacle it won't do it. And  when the lanes bend its really Hard for me. And why do you Have to watch an ad to get free revives, get some tokens, refill the Battery for the special Mission and to open the green and blue prize pod AND to Double bananas you collect? GREAT GAME I JUST HATE THE ADS."

        "this is a really funand cute game, but the gamer does not care to keep the challenges updated for the game but gladly take your money to get drones and equipment. suggest that if you get this game do not put one cent into it . you can earn what you need to get tools and drones thaqt you need. It's a shame that a gamer will make a fun and cute game like this then just drop it. But they gladly take your money and you can see where there is plenty of room for growth. but apparently Two Men And A Dog do not care if you like their game or not they just want your money and that's it. Would have given a 5 star for this game but gamers will not keep it going and updated. shame",
        "Love he game but would not advise anyone putting any money into this game. I have had this game for over two years now. And they Do Not keep their updated. Just says new challenges coming soon. If it hasn't came in two years it probably isn't. If they would add new challenges I would love to give them a five star. But for the last two years they just want to take your money. So if this game just earn your gems to get more drones and to update her tools. Don't pay them money for not keeping this game going. Plenty of room to update they just will not do it. Shame too is a good game . Could be better with new challenges.",
        "I love this game I have it on my tablet but there is one problem. Please please make this game compatible for Samsung galaxy s7.  Because i want to get it on my phone but it wont let me download it. It just says device not compatible. Please fix and i will rate 5 stars because i love this game.",
        "Funny characters, endearing cartoon aesthetic and enjoyable game play, but after a couple hunts forces you to wait over 8 minutes before you can actually play again (in order to entice you to pay to make the wait times go away). What kind of game compels you to QUIT out of BOREDOM after playing it for 5 minutes?",
        "I would have rated this game 5 stars but for the fact that I'm at level 82 and it says more missions coming soon... Who does that? This is the best game I've played in a while so it was a bummer when I saw the message. Explain why this is so or just fix it already. I have no issues with the game itself - control, graphics etc, but this pause is driving me crazy. There's no game without a mission. It defeats the purpose.",
        "Dear two man and a Dog, This is the best game I have ever played in my life. But some thing is still missing. After catching zombies the drone search for zombies.It takes few miniutes.I would like to request you guys that add a mode where I can catch zombies and earn some reward. This mode will not support drone. it is endless mode. I can play whenever I want it wont support finding zombies time.Also please maje the levels more bigger. I mean the levels are too small.Also make the drones more cheaper.  Last and final add 2 maps name underworld aand desert. This wil make the game more interesting.If u add this update quickly next time this game will get 5 stars.Thank you very much."

So as I'm really generous I will give it lots of stars and a it's okay game plz remove all adds and yeah that will be fine okay ‚ò∫üòôüòò",
        "Game unresponsive to any input on Nvidia Shield / Android TV as of the Feb 28 release.  It worked great before. Now the game starts but then it‚Äôs unresponsive to any input (controller, remote, keyboard). Other games work normally. I tried everything. Running latest version of OS, cleared game cash, game data, uninstalled game, restarted Nvidia Shield then reinstalled game. Same thing, not accepting any other input.  If this problem is resolved, I will edit my review back to 5 stars since I love the game.",
        "Update: the game keeps stealing coins from me. I had 227 coins, won a single prize, immediately play a game or two with the character, and the next time I looked I only had 16 coins. And that is not the only time it has done that. Very frustrating.   Original review: The only real thing I'd love to be changed is the ability to switch it so the game slants upwards from the left to the right. That way, if you are using your right hand, your thumb doesn't block the view of oncoming traffic.",

And the second issue is regarding storage permission. I didn't give the app that permission and it keeps asking everytime I start a new game to allow that permission. Fix these issues please."

The only thing I didn't like about it was that I couldn't get anything higher than 300 most of the time for the score, no matter what I did. The only time I did was the first time I installed it and played, I easily reached 1,500 points, but anytime I played after I could never come anywhere close, so I decided to look for a different game with the same concept and found this one. Instantly loved it! It's got more block room (so easier to get more points), love the sound effects, I don't feel cheated or set up like the other one, and it's a good way to get your mind working if you're someone like me who likes to think it through and plans for future possible block pieces c: plus the colors and looks is a bonus!^-^",

On the plus side, I like how it has stickers and how you can make your own ean I think that factor is really cool and a way to interact with the game.",

As funny and silly this app is it can be a bit gross. Like blood and organs and stuff. The more this game updates the better it gets keep those updates coming. GREAT game.",
        "I like it a lot this game is so good but there is one thing that really bugs me.  There is way to many ads.  Every time I play a set of games to get a good score and I click play again or main menu or practice it gives me an ad.  This really bothers me please put less ads or at least do not make them quite as long.",

        "Love that you can now earn gems from reading.  However part of the fun of games like this is the outfits and personalization of your character. Outfits and style choices should be free to choose the best one that advances you in the story. It's not fun playing a game that forces you to fail/have a negative outcome. Big decisions/game altering choices should cost gems that makes it fun spending your savings but ultimately free outfit/style choices please",
        "I LOVE THIS! But, just a thing, you could like ask on every episode (that the app creators make) like 'what's your gender and preference to date' because all the creator made ones at like just girls, and I know males play as well. Not hating AT ALL,I LOVE this app SO MUCH! Just tryna help ya improve! Luv you episode! (Or make more that are inclusive of gender) MEOW LOVE U",
        "I really like 90% of this game. However, the way the passes are done really suck. I absolutely love when the 30 days unlimited ad free pass comes up for $9.99. Without it I practically refuse to play. It doesn't seem to be available as of a few days ago. I'm glad I recently purchased. Would also be cool to have a feature where you can send passes to friends.",
        "It's an ok app and this is my third time redownloading it, the character designs have gotten better but there only problem I have, the tickets, like really? 2 tickets? First it was 5, then 3, now only 2. Not everyone has money to waste on games, especially tickets, not only that but their overpriced, like any other add on pack/item. I wouldn't even be surprised if I deleted this and redownloaded back in a year and they only give you one ticket a day.",
        "Love this game! The only part I don't like is that all of the best options cost diamonds and you literally have to pay for them. It makes sense for an app, but it happens to often. It ruins the story because I won't buy any diamonds. I'll rate this 5 stars if they at least change it to not as often.",
        "I LOVE IT except in pitch perfect, ALL the good choices cost 20 diamonds and I'm not wasting my money on all of that. Can you make it less often? And the passes take too long to come back. Or at least make it more passes every 3 hours"

        "The Game is unmatched. My issue is in car price changes which id give no star for. Im also becoming abit bored by the game because the cars i have left to by can only be acquired via tokens or cash. Not everyone can afford to pay continuous amounts to get further in a game. Scrap the cash and reward good driving. By the way, this is the best game üáøüá¶I've ever played",
        "AWESOME man I love the game man best graphics ever! Insane gameplay I love it . I already know that Gameloft will give best graphical experience ever but the game is frikkin good .but the recent update have a slight problem. It is the details of objects takes time to form fully. But the race is done before it . Please fix this problem.",
        "You have to change the controls to tap left and right to turn. And change the sensitivity to 100%. Once that is done th controls are good.   Good game, it would have been nice to be able to play against your friends over the internet also, not just wi fi. It needs rewards in local wi fi also.. S class class cars turn with 1 second delay, which is very frustrating",
        "I am using samsung note 8 and this game hangs in between....and also ask for wifi or data for update...  I believe thisgame is come to its end...    After recent update game cannot start and crash after gameloft logo.... I played all ashphalts till now but badly stuck with this version....have to download alot of data and cost of this game may goes higher then ma cell....team assphalt do some thing fast....",
        "Best racing game on Android for me. But It we have to buy credits it the most difficult process. It will be a game-changer and very good turn if We Can sale maxed out cars which we have and get credits in Return. I guess this feature will be awesome. Love this Game",
        "Why am I forced to download 1.5 gb data for this game daily?? Getting fed up man! Everyday I am downloading and the next day it asks again. Its seriously frustrating. Kindly give all updates in one download pls."

        "Good, with a major flaw I've ran into an issue that occurs about 1 out of every 3 rounds, where I'll tap, and the game won't register the trap until well after the position I wanted. For a game based on timing and your ability to stack moving blocks, when you tap is important, and needs to be 100% reliable. I'm on a Nexus 6P, very new phone with excellent hardware. I've closed all background apps, to try and troubleshoot. It's an issue I'd like to see fixed.",
        "I Would Give It Five Stars...but...you should make it customizable for the colors you want to cycle through as you stack higher. THIS GAME IS NOT COLOR BLIND FRIENDLY. Great Idea Though, Nice Hand Eye Coordination Exercise. (I see Black and White, so a monochrome setting would be nice. Other people see colors differently as well) Needs A Color Cycle Customizer, or a set of different options for each type of Color Blind. Thanks in advance",
        "Great simple game with AMAZING colours‚ù§ I love this...dead simple and fun. It took me ages to work out how to unlock the new skins...click on the banner that has the amount of diamonds you've collected and what looks like 3 sheets on top of one another  (it comes up before you press the start key...)",
        "A Great Game For When You're Dumpin'. I decided to install it because I ran out of YouTube videos while droppin' a duce. I really enjoy and will be using it the next time I'm in here as well. The ads are there, but they aren't too bad and there is an option to remove them for a small fee as well (which I plan to do.) My time in the bathroom has flew by because of the game and I'm happy to say that. I don't like to stay too long. Great game!",
        "So,  basically it's a pretty fun app to play when you're bored. It's a great time killer, and is very challenging, but at the same time easy! It's a perfect app! I remember I downloaded this, and then I uninstalled it because I needed other apps on my phone. And now I installed it again, so then I have a fun game to play. I don't really have any games on my phone, so this is the perfect one. The inventors are genius! Five stars!!",
        "Challenging and aesthetically pleasing A well made, minimalist stacking game which takes a long time to master, with nice simple visuals, a satisfying game mechanic and good sound effects. The instant replayability makes for a good competitive game amongst friends. The only reason it doesn't have a 5* is because I feel more could have been added to it, and done with the mechanic."

I mean when I first downloaded it there was only 6 levels XD  I know that should be a good thing but I can't seem to finish them all lol. GREAT GAME!!! DOWNLOAD RIGHT NOW!!! LIKE... RIGHT NOW!!! IT'S AMAZING AND I BET YOU'LL HAVE IT FOR AT LEAST 4 MONTHS!!!",

        "Awesome game controls are just great but the only thing I didn't like was that the balls other than the normal one was for real money u guys could make the others balls for diamonds that we get during the gameplay  so we could also actually make use of the diamonds  otherwise the game is awesomeüëçüëçüëç",
        "Ok haters shut ur pie hole and listen up  This is really fun game üíüda game cuz it's a time killer like how u can try out diffent skins at the beginning and how it's really fun ads r ok cuz dey only pop up when u want them 2 like when u get extra lifes etc. And they only randomly appear about every 3-5 mins so is ok üòÅ",
        "This game is fun but one problem.  My ball keeps randomly rolling off the edge for no reason. Plz fix this then u will get 5 stars."

        "The game is enjoyable but I don't care for the new animated Charlotte. Instead of adding \"realism\", she is simply annoying. Other than that, it's fairly good. The number of coins needed to continue a level with 5 extra moves is a bit much compared to the number received when you complete the level (300 vs 25-30 or so). I understand, though. It can't be too easy or else it would be boring & nobody would ever spend any $ to advance!üòÅ"

        "I started this game when it first came out. There were hardly any game advantages and everyone was having fun and on the same playing field. As more and more packages got released into the game it became a pay to win situation. I personally do not think spending $100+ on a phone game is a wise investment. Thus I enjoyed the game by taking advantage of their events and the prizes within the game. However, it has become dominated by people who payed to be the big guy and the little people get absolutely demolished. It has taken the fun out of playing, which really dissapoints me as it was a fun game to play.",
        "This game has potential to be fun but it's completely ruined because IT'S COMPLETELY PAY-TO-WIN which sucked the fun out of the game that I quit. Don't get me wrong, Final Fantasy is highly respected RPG franchise because it's full of great games in the series. But no this one.  However, I might come back if the game developers make it not as pay-to-win as it is now. Right now, it's a complete money bucket!",
        "This game is great and fun, I love spending my time playing this game. One problem though, what is going on with the packages? Why is it every time a package is bought all the packages go from 20 to 100 dollars ? We should be able to buy the 20 dollar packages more than once! Is that fixable? Please cuz i do want to keep playing but 100 dollars is too much.",
        "The game is very addictive and fun to play. Some of the people playing the game are wonderful and fun to game with. Graphics are very good for a on line game played on phone, tablet or computer. The quests are challenging at best. BUT!!! BE WARNED... This game is not for young children as there is explicit language and cut throat people playing the game. After all it is a war game and nothing more. Now down to the nitty-gritty of the game. Yes it's free, but that only get you so far before you will need to buy packs in the game to advance and unlock the two new characters. The game quests are designed for people to spend if you want to get ahead fast. Large amounts of  $$$$$$ Cash are needed to play this game. $$$$$$ Personal note, I know people who have spent thousands on this game. Over all the game is great for young adults on up. PG-15",
        "I absolutely LOVE my guild!!! Everyone is so cool,from all over the States & all over the world...have friends in other guilds as well from all over the world...my guild is like my \"family\"...some of us have even talked about meeting up with each other...I hope to finally meet some of my favorite people,especially our guild leader...we're like the best of friends!!! Although,he lives in TX & I'm from Michigan,we're both married ,but there's nothing I wouldn't do for him!!! Thanks so much for giving me this opportunity to meet such wonderful people!! Lifelong friends/family!!! üíú",
        "This game is great and will make you feel tho go all out. It challenges you in a healthy way and keeps you on your toes. Join a guild, trust me. You can do a lot by yourself but joining a guild in this game is actually fun. I haven't experienced anything toxic, yet. I've been playing for about a week and it's really great"

        "Nice game with very good events but the drop rates to heroes of 5 star is too low i killed a lot of gems and scrols and hero orbs and my first 5 star i  dropped it at lvl 75. Okok now again event of summoning 100 scrolls and i continue still no 5 star hero only 4, just try and fix the drop rate. In the rest its a nice game.",
        "Excellent game. Best Idle, if not best game period on the market. Not really P2W, just pay to speed up. Heroes are amazing, unique and cool. There are also lots of other things to do besides just idle and wait to get stronger. So much content and you're given free gems from watching adds. Doesn't make you pay to succeed or have fun. Literally no complaints. And that's coming from someone that just in general has an issue with 99% of mobile  games. Download this!",
        "Fun at first, but you have to pay a lot of real money for it to stay fun. Otherwise you have to wait weeks and months to progress. Some events can only be fully completed by spending hundreds of dollars (yeah, that much). Not worth it. If you have that much money, use it on something better than this. Improve your life, use your time better, don't waste it here. Good luck!",
        "I purchased the spring festival card on top of all the money I've already dumped into this game and the devs didn't give me my in game rewards. I've submitted numerous tickets to get a refund or my rewards and they just reply there is no problem. Ya no problem with you taking my money.  They deleted my review, wonder how many other people had this issue and had reviews deleted.",
        "Wasn't sure about this game at first. I love it. I use a f2p  and a vip one  to see  the difference  between the two. Really well done. Having said all that the game does require patience. This is an IDLE game. You pick it up do dailies, talk, spend money, or what ever you want to do in game, then put it down to \"farm gold,xp,mats\". The high end heros do take some planning to aquire as a f2p player. This game requires patience because it's an IDLE game. Yes some people have a ton of money to throw at the game but don't be jealous, just play your game and have fun.",
        "Not what I expected, given that my first impression of it was of IH being an \"annoying add\". Once I decided to pick it up though my thoughts changed rather drastically.   It's simple, it's fun and the warm colour palette of the graphics make a nice change compared to the widespread use of bleak colours in other games.   If you think you might enjoy this game, you sure are my friend."

        "Good game, played it over a long period here and there and I've basically completed it.  Would love to see more planets! And bigger challenges, as currently every time I go on it my little explorers are making over 1.5 million a day and I've got no where to take my space funding! Haha   Great game imo, just needs more features, planets, asteroids maybe. :) Good job.",
        "A very fun game that is both simple and a bit challenging because you have to make literal split-second taps to get it to work properly. The only downside is that it's a very short game. There are only two places to colonize and once you've done them and reached level 10 on both, there's really nothing left to do. It would be nice if they added more levels to colonize or some other form of continuation.",
        "Be cool if there is boosts. Example if you get 3 perfect you get a free auto perfect boost or something. Also plz add a line of code to stop people from the date/time bug abuse - save current time to file. Player won't get money till that last input time has passed.  Also be cool to spend the coins on boosts",
        "It's a fun game, just need more planets to jump to and more rocket skins. The colony is just a bunch of people standing on the planet. When I think of colony, I think of buildings and sustaining life and such. Would be nice to see the 'colony' grow bigger each time you rank up. (Example, more buildings etc.) Also, a choice of a button to press when detaching the rocket and different rocket shapes to choose from. Thank you",
        "Before the update it was quick to grind lots of cash but still it took some time. With my current build, I was reaching 10k+ averaging Greats and Awesomes but now after the update I barely scratch 8K! You guys nerfd the fuccc out the rocket power!!! NEW PLAYERS DON'T EVEN BOTHER WITH THIS! IT WILL TAKE YOU A VERY, VERY, VERY LONG TIME TO GRIND!!!",
        "Its a great game but ive fully upgraded my earth space ship and i am level 10 on earth and mars. I have about 8000 people on europa and theres no more planets to discover so its boring now. We want alot more plants and diffrent upgrades!!"

Whenever i see an advertisement to reduce waiting time for tickets, the time won't reduce and this happens like 10 to 20 times in a day.",

Unless you spend real money to get the parts. One question I do have. Is about the blackridge rivals. Why put some one with a car at a way higher level against a person who's car isn't even close to the car at a high level, and one more thing... make the races longer. 20 seconds a race isn't fun at all. Thinking with the name \"Need For Speed\". You guys would of done a lot better. The only thing that I seem to like are the  graphics... But that's about it...",

Also, please just open the spa and the other stuff you cant get unless you pay!",
        "This is from my daughter, \"I like the game but there's some things about it I kind of don't understand. Some of the controls are a little difficult like the one where you have to tap 1 or tap 2 when she's practicing. And its fun. Some of it I like a lot.\"   This is from me, \"the app is annoying until you buy it. It downloaded a ton of icons (ads for other games) to my picture gallery without informing me. My daughter likes the game a lot and it's fun, but a bit intrusive with the free version. The gameplay is good overall.\"",
        "I love the game but there should be coins so you can by the beam vault and all the other stuff , not with real money and the beam and vault always says coming sone so if you can update that would be amazing and if you could let me know that would be good.",
        "It's a cool game, it just could be better and maybe there could be some other things in the update. Don't take it seriously! I'm not trying to be mean but maybe there could be some other leotards and the update and some more hair dues because all of those buns and people may not like that's just buns people may want the braids that you always have in your other games. I mean the French braids and they keep going down into a braid, all those things would be nice!",
        "Still waiting for an update to get the other two activities for the gymnastics   How long to you expect us to wait, some of us have paid money on this   Please hurry up and get it updated please",
        "Really was enjoying this app, then about 10 minutes in video ads started popping in literally every 1 or 2 minutes. This totally killed the fun factor; not only was I unable to complete any tasks or just enjoy the game but the crummy ads actually kept booting me off the app. What a complete buzz kill; even tho this app was super cute & the graphics were total eye candy, the constant interruptions barging in were beyond ridiculous; both in longevity & frequency."

Can't play with the data packages only strong wifi.  You didn't fix this in the new edition of the game and the rush mode is not working. The new party is sucks big time. Fix fix fix",
        "I love this game on laptop but when i play it on my android mobile the display area is very small compare to its area on laptop. You must built application in a way it can shows up more area on 5 inch display screen so we can see cells comming to eat us. And it can be done effectively by showing things smaller."

I went over other reviews and the developers wanted to know which ads. Seriously?! How about all of them?! They have to be aware yet refuse to fix the problem. Do not download this intrusive app. Also I get a migraine with the annoying \"Ready? Let's go!\" voice when the sound is on.",
        "Great strategy based game, awesome, however out of 326 levels only 323 could be completed. Level 324 the colors are not chain linked they are totally erratic and the colors you're given are inconsistent. They alternate in color as well to ensure failure. Still I enjoyed it. Side note, I played the game without using any cheats, which is the reason level 324 is a trapdoor the idea is to purchase cheats. Thanks great game.",
        "The coding in this game obviously needs work.  Balls given not colors needed.  Spot aimed at missed and ball lands somewhere else.  The last chest I opened lvl 30 something gave no item.",
        "Fun, but... Worst aim system. You can see ball curve away instead of following straight path. Color balls rotate without your input. You are shooting blue, but yellow goes instead. This happens very frequently. Lastly, had 20 straight of same color. Only needed one of another color to finish that level. Still playing, but game is very frustrating.",

        "As expected, it looks and performs amazing. Fighting mechanics and modes are pretty innovative and thrilling. It is quite stupid to compare the console version with mobile one. Each one has its own unique style, so they should NOT look the same, cz' each one provides the fans with a different gaming experience. This surely increases the already huge number of fans of Tekken. 5 üåü game",
        "WOW, great memories came back. Amazing graphics, and story is going good so far. Only thing is the controles, I mean you should have given the original TEKKEN controls with the moves n all. Its now like a small kid can play. Their is no fun n pressure of making the right punch or through as the good old days. If you guys can make a lit like that, then its will more gold in a gold mine. Otherwise is a nice game.  Thank you",
        "Samsung Galaxy S6... Alright, they went and fixed the release bug crashes within a day or two. I finally got to enjoy the game. It's pretty decent. I'm enjoying the whole fighting/build your characters concept. As promised, I've raised my rating. (Probably could give more on the post mission drops) other than that, I love how there isn't a limit to how many missions you can do and have to wait for an energy bar to replenish. Great game so far. (Give more on the drops though lol... seriously)",
        "First off, the thought of the game and concept of direction it went in for a mobile game is fair, I'll give it that. But... I will say, being one of the best franchises ever created, I expected more. Not another knockoff style of Marvel and DC's (and MK's) style of fighting game. I expected originality from an original creator. The having to heal and near impossibility of play at a certain point (unless you pay a lot...) steered me away from it, tbh.",
        "This game is beautiful! I have always loved Tekken ever since the 1st and have played them all. I only wish some of my favorite characters weren't missing, like Lei and Bryan and I haven't seen Yoshimitsu or Heihachi Mishima. Overall I am very impressed. Thanks, I have been waiting for this on Android for a long time! I would rate 4.5 stars ‚ò∫",
        "So far I've been enjoying it. It's nothing too special, typical mobile fighting game but Tekken. The fact that's it Tekken makes it more enjoyable than average because I love Tekken, but that's just me. I feel that acquiring new characters needs to be way easier than it is, especially when you need to take on harder missions for bonus materials and currency. I don't like how you have to wait for characters health to regenerate. If characters healths auto filled per mission, I would definitely put more time into the game. Since it isn't, I have to constantly stop playing and wait for the health to refill, and I don't wait to use healing items because it takes away from my in game currency, which itself is difficult to obtain if you aren't constantly grinding. Aside from that, it's fun. Very fun, I recommend."

        "Love the idea of this game! Love everything about it. The graphics are amazing. The only thing i would recomend is making another way to get energy for example introducing a bed or regenerating it fast because ill play for like 10 minutes then wont play it again until the following day. If you want me to play all day id regenerate the energy faster or even make it less to travel to places. Please make energy last longer!!  Please let wood grow back in home camp so i dont have to waste slots on wood when travelling. Otherwise its an amazing game. Wish it aas on ps4.",
        "I was really enjoying this game and would have given 5 stars but...seems like its getting harder to find items and to collect them.  I can only find basic items and the items I really need are no where to be found.  Its hard to upgrade my house as well. Am I missing something? You said thank you for helping, yet you didn't answer my question.",
        "Its good üëç... just the loot is quite hard.. i increased my rate.. for cool update. Kafr i request can u make an event like a dealer where we can trade items to other online player through radio like the dealer??? Like will make a deal meet like meeting dealer",
        "Very good game. 1 tweek I would suggest, have the guns run out of ammo instead of totally breaking! Seems weird to have a gun like a glock or m16 that you can't reload. And then you either find or can make more ammo for it. Also make the higher level melee weapons not break so easily, a home made spear might well break, but a machete would last a life time!",
        "well. I cant enter my home after this update. I tried to run to some place come back and enter or running to some random place entering exiting and returning. So i cant acsess my chopper or my tickets and i cant enter my home. I really want to enjoy this new update but i cant go enter my home its just stuck on the loading screen. I hope you see this and help.",
        "Love the game, but would be better if The Big One wasn't always in the yellow and red locations, I have died several times because of the raider tasks to loot 25 chests on red locations. Please fix this."

Second if u have money in millions, the cost of the parts are also in million and so on, and even having millions of dollars in the game u might fail to upgrade vehicle sometimes  that makes no sense.",
        "I really like this game and its one that I can play continuously, my only problem is that I can only play once a day.. the game will work for as long as I play but as soon as I exit I can't back on until the following day. It sucks because I have to complete as much of the game as possible in a certain amount of time and that kills the fun. I can't just enjoy it and play a bit then carry on playing a bit later.. please fix this I really enjoy.this game and its getting ruined a bit for me...",

Contact me as soon as possible.",

I feel happy and relef when I complete the game and go on that ship. I think there will be a helicopter because in start there is a helicopter. But nevermind awesome game. Make part 3. Bye..... And I read there is hidden kits? What is this. Why I don't read it before. I can't find any kit. But what is kit? Nevermind I completed the game. One more time. Awesome game. Bye.....",

And can you let geometry dash world players create and play user created levels. Fix and add this and I will give you 5 stars. Gameplay and graphics are nice.",
        "Got all the way to the end,  and an as popped up accidentally clicked on it cuz it was being slow,  and ended up having to restart all of the levels,  fix this,  it doesn't happen with the other geometry dash games,  just this one every time I exit my data gets deleted...  Fix then 5 stars",

        "I love this game just...can you fix one glitch? On the final level final area the wave is bugged ...when I tap it goes down by itself! Can you please fix it? I was trying over 3 hours to make it but I can' t because of the glitch :( Please fix it.",

I finally have a little sneak peek, although‚Ä¶                                           A) No Spider in main levels (Challenge excused) B) Ads‚Ä¶ugh                                                        C) No Account Loading (2.1 fixed)                                      D) Levels too easy and short                               It‚Äôs still great!"

It's not really fair for those who aren't of pale skin. Thank you for all the progress and work made so far, & I really hope that there's a way you can make this happen. Thanks!   (I would give a full five stars if everyone could have equal ability to wear different makeups)",
        "I never write reviews, but this game deserves all the praise possible. Downloaded it for my niece and turns out I am the one addicted!! I'm a daily player now and love the fact that you can start your own group for 300 gems and approve applications and interact with your stylist association members. That aspect took the game to a whole new level. The clothing is beautiful and the attention to detail is great!!! Give it a shot and you just may become addicted like myself. I do spend around 20 bucks a week, but it was just as much fun before I was spending money, I just wanted the special clothes for events.",
        "In depth in both gameplay and attention to details of awarded items. Continuous hours not required but with once a day of incentive activities. Controls are  sometimes unstable. If a glitch does happen, its fixed fast and your also awarded for time spent. Very happy customer. Enjoyed the best dress up game I've played so far. Thank you makers!",
        "I've been playing this game for about 5 months now, it has amazing graphics and wonderful gameplay. My only problem with it is a lot of the times its very difficult to obtain the events suits. I feel like the only way for you to complete a suit is to spend some sort of cash. I get that you have to make an earning but it just makes the game annoying to play. I would also like more skin tone options and would like the makeup to be compatible. Anyways thank you for creating a wonderful game.",
        "Lovely game! Gorgeous clothes and gameplay. A little cheesy in. The story but fairly creative for a dress up game. Plus it can be hilarious with how wild the lore gets around fashion. Design can be a little overcrowded sometimes but everything is coordinated so it still looks nice. Backgrounds are gorgeously painted. Tutorial is easy to understand but isnt too tedious. I am officially addicted",
        "I never write reviews, but this game really deserves a high one. I got this game because my friend Emily adores it, and I have been playing NON STOP. It's so beautiful and high quality for just a dress up game. It's absolutely wonderful. My favorite thing is that you can really enjoy the game without having to use real money on in app purchases. Yeah, you can if you want to, but your experience isn't less if you don't. A high quality and fun game. I adore it"

IT DOES NOT SAVE YOUR PROGRESS AND IF YOU TRY TO USE AN ACCOUNT TO SIGN-IN, IN ORDER TO SYNC YOUR PROGRESS TO THE ACCOUNT OR TO FB IT WILL NOT RECOGNIZE THE ACCOUNT!

        "This game used to be awesome, sadly I have just removed it due to the star issue. I used to be able to play for fun, however, due to the its current standing, one MUST achieve three stars in each level in order to play other levels. Madness! Great job for taking the fun out of a game!",
        "Angry Birds used to be a game you could just tap on and play to your heart's content.  Now it's gone fee-to-pay (sic) -- you can read the other reviews to see how well that has been received.   Not well is an understatement.  I'd say more, but you'll have to gain 50 more stars to read each new paragraph.  Meanwhile, watch these unskippable half-minute-long ads.",
        "Wth ! Game gets hanged, as soon as you use mighty scope in mighty league. Not one time, or occasionally. Everytime since last update. WHAT A MESS ! Above that it repeatedly cannot find internet connection, be it WiFi or DataPack.  GIVING 3STAR, for good old game. If no fix found, will keep downgrading.",
        "Love this game but keeps freezing, a lot! It's more frustrating since the update where it costs 30 coins for the telescope but only get 5 minutes instead of 10 now and half the time my games frozen and the time runs out FIXXX",
        "Too many ads way too often. I get a few sponsored ads help keep apps free or inexpensive but the frequency here makes the app annoyingly unuseable. Sponsors need to realise that the more we consumers are harassed with unwanted advertising, the LESS we will be interested in their product. I outright boycott or blacklist such companies and products."

        "If you've liked the first game you're probably gonna enjoy this one. It's more dynamic and there are plenty more content. Unfortunately it's built around microtransactions so if you're feeling like expending some money things might get easier. I just don't understand how they  screwed the controls this much, it's likely you're going to try placing a plant more than three times before making it.",
        "Great game. Lots of fun. For those who aren't aware: Some levels are super hard to beat BECAUSE THEY REQUIRE UPGRADED PLANTS. Level up gives you something to do in the game expanding its lifespan. Level up is not that easy. Don't expect to end all levels Ancient Egypt with level 2 plants; level 3 or 4 are fine!",
        "Free to play games are always the same formula: Starts off addictive, gets more challenging, starts encouraging you to buy gem equivalent, forces you to buy gem equivalent. At least most other games are fair with it though, giving you a chance. PVZ 2 does not. Levels go quickly from fun to I'm done, and become impossible. I'd love to see developers or game testers try to complete later levels without gems, especially Big Wave Beach. It's a shame, as the first game remains a classic. Buy the first game and Garden Warfare if you like it. Leaf this game alone, it's a sprout at best. Oh and remember, if zombies try to break into your house, throw your money at them.",
        "Love this game so much! I am a huge PVZ fan anyway and I love playing this. You do need some boosters to get past levels, which feels a bit like cheating sometimes, but you can earn plenty of coins. There is always a new quest to play so even when I'm stuck on the other levels I can still play. This is a great game, well done devs!",
        "I love this game! One thing though, I believe that there are too many plants that cost real money to get. Could you please make some more plants that you can get them by being able to unlock them by playing the game, instead of ones where you have to use real money. Besides that, this is a really great game!",
        "BEST EVER GAME I HAD PLAYED IN MY LIFE!!!!!  Great game! Too addictive and it is the best favourite game ever and the hardest edition you will ever find in it. Even challenging. I am the biggest obsessed fan of pvz! Try it once you will find tons of fun and challenges and even gameplay and graphics!"

        "Cool game and really realistic. I give it a good rating. But can you plz update game sothat more players can join 1 room and plz plz plz plz add more possibility's like feeding cows can give more cows and then you can sell some of your cows and buy new ones. Or you can build a pig stall and buy/sell pigs and upgrade a farm house or build a horse place. Or paint some buildings. I would spread the game to all my friends and people i know if you add some of those things. Plz add some of them cause I really like the game alot.",
        "Good games. Fun.. Need more equipments for farm like oldest planters to newest planter balers drill seeds ects. Need john deere too. Need rid of slurry thing not need it. All need is manure and spreader or just hual manure to make mulchs for fields to cover up dirts and need oldest tractors to newest tractos also",
        "Purchased a bunch of tractors and unlocks and had my account charged only to find the game to block me from using my purchases. This game is a money scam. Do not be tricked into making in app purchases. I even tried contacting giants software to give them a chance to correct but to no surprise i did not recive a response to my email, they got my money why would they care now. Save yourself from being taken by this company!!!!",
        "I have absolutely no qualms about giving 5 stars. It's a nice game. I  hope their updates will give an alternative way to the tilt control of vehicles. It's tiring. Can you also consider faster response to queries to your customer care Department?",
        "Fun game that really passes the time. Only complaints I currently have are:  1. I just bought a new harvestor and there's no \"work\" button so I can harvest my crop. Trying to give it some time because it seems like a glitch. 2. I'd really like to be able to manage animals as well. Like chickens, pigs, goats, etc.  3. It would be nice to be able to store things IN the barn. 4. It'd take the game over the top if you could interact with and customize your house on the farm.",
        "WHERE are half of my purchases??!!?? I know for sure I bought the big red harvester and the bigger mower, tredder, and wind rower yesterday. My first save has them but today its saying their all locked and I have to purchase again... and yesterday I'm pretty sure I got charged for 250k coin package twice and only received coins for 1 purchase. Can you please fix this or I will be forced to contact Google billing to solve this. FYI I have tried the restore button but that doesn't work as well. I gave you guys several days to respond and nothing. So I'm going to have to cancel those charges"

        "This is overall the best golf game I have come across or any app, in general, relating to sports. My only problem is that sometimes people do not want to, not do not have the ability to create a facebook account. I wish there would be a way to play with your family; without the facebook account users perks.",
        "I like the game, and it's addictive, but the mechanics are absolutely flawed. There have been tons of instances where the game has unfairly screwed me or other player's over. 1. Places mystery boxes in front of the player who drives second, but not the first player. 2. Hills like to stop a ball, that is being shot full force by an iron club, in it's tracks. 3. The swinging spike balls only affect some players golf balls, but not others.  Things like this piss people off, because they expect the game to be fair. Those small things easily aid a player in losing a match.",
        "This game would be awesome if it matched you with people equal to your level but it doesn't. So I spend more time trying to get to the higher levels and not able to upgrade equipment. Of course you could always purchase money but I'm not big on doibg that!",
        "Fun game. But you definitely have things to fix. Like the fact that sometimes when you win, you still lose. And I'm not talking about having less gems. I'm talking  when the other player doesn't even in the hole. Definitely a glitch. Also, as far as controls....easy enough. But sometimes while I'm in the middle of a backswing, the ball will shoot on it's own without me releasing it. Which sucks because it's a wasted shot and usually costs you the match. Aside from those two irritating problems, it really is a fun game. I will continue to play, hoping you fix the issues.",
        "Game cheats, puts you against lower lol players with better equipment who make ungodly shots, or much higher level where you don't have a chance. I hit things that aren't there, and with a crossword my ball will fly into the wind with no action. Opponent Always get better wind and direction, and will outshoot you work lower equipmeny.",
        "I love the game I find it very entertaining. I also like being able to interact globally. But the only one thing that I would change, would be to make the analog where you pull back your driver smaller screened devices. Besides that I have no complaints. I love the game! üòäüòä"

But it doesent matter for much. I give all 5 star for best graphics, bedt controls, and also bestest weapons. I love this game. Thank you gameloft. We expect that you will keep developing games like modern combat. I am waiting anxiously for next series. Thank you.",
        "I had previously given this game a 1 star but for this update I'm blown away by the network rectification aspect. The game runs butter smooth even after post FUP data speeds. The game is currently saturated with lvl 140 players with all the prestige weapons, so I'd request you to bring about a balanced match making in the PvP based on their matching levels and introduce some welcome benefits for the returning players",
        "I am facing one issue but first I want to tell you that this is the best game on play store.. It's worth to download that 1.5 gb data than 100-200 mb games.. Graphics are great. Only problem I am facing is the voice issue.. I couldn't hear the sound from last 3-4 days but I m still giving 5 stars as I hope you will solve this issue asap..",
        "This probably the best FPS game in the Play Store. Graphics, animations, music, voice actings everything in this game are awesome. üòä  The game runs in my phone in full 60 fps on Ultra-high settings. But sometimes it crashes without any reason and when I run the game again, it starts to verify game data. My phone is not rooted and I do believe the problem is not in my phone, it's a bug in the game. üòï  Overall, it's a great game. ‚ò∫Ô∏è  Peace out. ü§ò",
        "Fantastic game! It's by Gameloft so it's bound to be a good phone game. It's not unfair, but you do have to have some skill. It doesn't hold your hand but it's not hard to learn the controls. Despite the fact that you're also playing against people who are on their computers as well, it's definitely not unfair. One request: maybe add more options for your killstreaks. I would love to have my drone and turret on the same killstreak for my sniper class but I'm stuck with recon instead. Still love it tho :)",
        "It's pretty good for what it is, but the controls suck. It's hard to aim and you risk firing instead of moving your aim. Rules of survival has a better fighting setup however it's a battle Royale not a traditional fps. A bit sad that they did it better really. Final nail in the coffin is the pay to win aspect. There's multiple classes in this game and by far, the paid classes provide incredible perks. I don't recommend this game."

Not only is it addicting, but it is fun and more challenging/authentic then any other maze games I've tried. There are plenty of levels/modes to keep you entertained. It's the only maze puzzle app I've found worth playing! üòÄüíú",

        "Sublime controls, varying but very original and fun game modes, and an online leaderboard for the ones interested..!  I'd easily rate this 5 stars if the white-on-grey theme didn't give me a headache! For the love of whatever God is out there, at least give the choice between a light and dark theme, PLEASE?!",
        "I'm not far into it, but it's fun so far. My eyesight could be why it's not a 5-star experience. The more complex levels are very small and give me a headache after a couple of mazes. I believe the contrast and color schemes could be improved and make the game better. It's still a very good game though.",
        "I love mazes and this game keeps me on my toes. Even though I haven't played it too long, an adult ad popped up that I felt was inappropriate. This concerns me because my 7yo daughter is also fond of mazes. Now I'll have to download a separate kid version for her.",
        "5 stars, the game does exactly what it should do, and the controls are simple and intuitive, but please, can you add a feature to prevent the screen from turning off? It messes a little when I try to mentally solve the classic mazes"

        "I'm a big fan of lego ninjago‚ô•. Its just hands of time I fight serpentine and when master Wu spoke I saw a timeblade. When I was chilling looking at my mission's then Lloyd hacked into Zane's computer he said something I just have a bad memory.",
        "It's awesome! I am a huge fan of ninjago. I love defeating enemies, changing my look, and even having so much fun!",
        "No controller support on Android TV. Very buggy playing on a tablet. Character gets stuck behind/in objects and you have to kill the game...",
        "This game could be amazing if it wasn't for the awful camera angles which make it impossible to see what you're doing. Fix this and the game would be amazing.",
        "I think if you could add a few extra spaces for more ninja then everybody would be happy .the reason I'm giving this app a 4 star rating is because you can only have up to five ninja on a mission including your own .if anybody would like that to happen then give this review a thumbs up."

        "I've played the same game/ level 3 times now and passed it. For some reason the game is stuck. It just brings me back to the beginning. Also if I won a bomb or a fire ball in one level and don't use it. It should carry over to the next.",
        "It's not fully free. It's designed to make you pay for extra bonuses otherwise it would be very difficult to pass a level. Uninstalling for this reason.",
        "It was fun to play earlier but as you reach the higher levels it becomes frustrating it seems like purposely it is not completing the challange ,.. my level is 1629 how much I try it is failed by single ball   ... It looks that they are not having further challanges  but  not agree to accept",
        "I'm about ready to give up on this.  The 'laser' balls introduced around level 1260 are both unplayable and completely pointless. The game is all about popping bubbles, well... it was until this point.   I was hoping to push through to the final levels but as long as these are in the game I really can't be bothered.   Honestly, when I have to guess the best time to launch balls based on totally random evidence... and lose when those balls are gobbled up for reasons I cannot fathom...  Following on... I've reached level 2082 and cannot possibly see how to  get further than about half way through with the balls provided!  I guess if I stick at it for a month or so I might be able to accumulate enough bonus balls to have a chance!  And there I was thinking that 2076 was tough!     And I **still** hate the laser balls!   Been playing for a year now... on the free version... you guys must have earned a motza from all the adverts that I've displayed!!  Update - I think I've found a bug in level 2215 - whenever I launch a ball it is immediately invisible and doesn't seem to have any effect on the balls it's aimed at. Randomly a ball will cause others to drop... sometimes invisible ones will appear as they drop.  I've rebooted the phone... problem still here.",
        "Way too many Ads! As soon as you finish a game Ads , ads, ads!",
        "Very addictive game. Just finished level 2530. I am getting ready to upgrade my phone. Is there any way to capture level data so i can start at my current level on my new phone?"

        "I LOVE this game ... like I am so hooked.... I spend way too much money though because I love all the dragons so much just so adorable I always buy the dragon bundles.   It does suck whenever you get so high up with feeding your dragons then it costs a lot of food to feed them like if I didn't buy so many dragon bundles I would have a hard time feeding them to higher levels... Even now it's hard.  Anyways I am addicted to this game though other than that!  ‚ô°‚ô°",
        "This game is very addictive, fun, and a great game over all. Eventually if you play it long enough there isn't much you can do on the app until you wait but other then that it's a decent time killer. I haven't ran into any issues with the game and I recomended installing it",
        "Love this game cause it fun and cute! And I've been playing this game for while and love it. By way Please rid ads video pop-up cause it is annoy, it would waste our time if popup too much and it would need limit, also it ate battery if you do that I will give 5 stars. Events are good and bad cause it is fun but hard time to finish  beacuse we need our live as sleep other to do.  Maybe it need extra.",
        "Honestly a great game. It has ads but those are optional. You only view ads if you want some extra stuff. You click on a button to view the ads and after, depending on what you picked you wanted, you get. So please don't think that the ads just randomly pop-up out of nowhere. They only appear if you choose for them to be there. I'd say download the game, you won't regret it üëç",
        "Shame I couldn't transfer my data from Windows 10 Mobile to Android. Would've been nice to continue my game instead of having to start afresh, but it's still a good game, and probably a better experience on Android.  It would be nice to be able to trade dragon eggs and other objects from my inventory with friends.",
        "I didn't know how insanely addictive this game is when I downloaded it. The graphics of the dragons are beautiful, but the background could use some work in that department. The gameplay is smooth and not impossible when you don't make purchases! Yet I did because this game is brilliant!!! I recommend it to anyone who is bored of just building and buying over and over. The different challenges and events are so well thought-out! I cannot get over this fantastic game!!!!!"

        "It just lags now. The new update made it to where my chat, my character, and my animations won't work. I run about as fast as a turtle, and I am not pregnant. Please fix!!!! I love this game. I have a few questions if you don't mind... Can you guys add in multi-player mode, like single player mode, that we can pick up our pups, it would be cool to add that option in the top left menu. Thank you guys so much!! Love the games!!",
        "I have only had this game for a few days, so I can't write a very comprehensive review just yet. But I have good feeling about this game. It is fun, challenging, with easy-to-learn controls. Less fast paced than Dragon SIM and less worlds and bosses. Customization is better though, and slower pacing may mean more long-term fun; not over so fast. Multiplayer is always a plus. Not pay-to-play, though paying gets you more benefits, it's up to you how you want to go about getting coins and acorns. Great game, few problems, would recommend.",
        "Most awesome wolf simulator game I have ever played! The graphics are absolutely beautiful, and the controls are pretty good. Although getting attacked by several animals at once when you only go for one makes completing missions pretty hard. And you should be able to run from a fight if you're losing, instead of having animals come at you until you're dead. All in all a great game play experience though. I love it!",
        "Man i love this game!!! So much better than wolfquest!!! I do hope tht this game soon be added new things like more animal to play as, better in performance. The ad free guys...keep it up!!! Just wondering if there's a add as mate system in multiplayer in the future? Anyways....this is the best wolf game tht i played!!! Do hope tht you guys one day add more animals to play as (like a snow leopard for example)",
        "Love it but pleeeeeaaaase make it possible to play as a boar or a rabbit or deer. Also I think it would be really nice to have a hunger and thirst bar because there is no real point in drinking. That way if you dont have enough food or water you start to lose health.  Also I don't think we really need stamina from the food we eat.  These are just suggestions but I really really love this game.  Best simulator out there.",
        "Most realistic wolf sim I have found out there, with the ability to get a mate, have cubs and your own den in which you can invite players into. There are also multiplayer game servers and an ability to create your own public or private game. You can also play as a wolf, fox or lynx and customize eyes, pelts and add masks/hats and scars/clothing. Its just AMAZING! Also saying that you don't have to pay to play and in-game currency is easy to get."

        "I used to love this game, very addictive but recent updates have made the game have too many elements (clubs - who cares???) Ads all over and money disappears quickly due to cost of each game.  Not easy to complete games it feels \"fixed\" with random cards plus drains the battery on my phone.  Uninstalled.",
        "This is my 3rd review. Love the game but had issues when ads were introduced. That was rectified, then had issues with new Android version. That was fixed and game was going fantastically for about 3 weeks and now they have reduced the amount of free treasure to $1000 instead of $5000. This means I need to come back 3x more often without playing a single game just to be able to play once.",
        "I would like it more if in the perk levels it showed how many club points were needed for each level and how many more are needed to finish the perk level. The green filling up the bar doesn't really accurately show how close you are. It looks like you are almost done, but then it takes forever to fill up so you don't know how many more points you need.",
        "This game has many issues! It continually freezes and shuts me down. I can no longer play on my tablet, which I purchased just for games, and have to use my phone. I don't like using my phone because it drains my battery. I am so ready to quit this game and return to candy crush instead. Latest updates have rendered JP and other perks useless.",
        "Originally I really liked this game BUT the further you go the  more it costs to play.  That was ok, but you add more and more ads in there, they are on the \"boards\" they are between the games, between the levels and NOW you have Tri Peaks Solitaire brought to you by, yet another game. I like it, as a game it's addictive and was  fun but I think I have had enough.  It's becoming not so much fun and headed for the uninstall list.",
        "I don't know if a review is still available  after a game has been deleted. The game was fun to play I'll say that. I didn't need 5 push notifications coming @ me in the middle of the night however. The one that came through @ 3:17 a.m. was it for me, I'm out."

        "Now these days, to be powerful is cards. And it's really sad to see it in one of my favorite fighting game. I have a galaxy s8 plus and when I put the controls on large, it feels like there on medium. If your playing duel and your opponent has 5 power points ahead of you, just call it a lost. Do better. Battlefront 2 is about to be banned in Germany because of the card system. I hope you look into it.  Edited: it's still the same. It feels like a pay to win. I'm going back to shadow fight 2. You know. The good one.",
        "I really like playing the game. It has great animations smooth gameplay and isn't too easy or hard. The one thing I dont like is you can't sell your old equipment or skills. If there was a shop to sell them or add runes to them or be able to combine them to make either new or more powerful ones of the sane type I would give this game 5 stars.hopefully the Devs will take this and add this feature in a update. Speaking of updates, I just installed the latest one it was like 403MB but nothing changed! What was the update for then?",
        "Hey NEKKI i have the best suggestion ever. WHY DON'T YOU add a grab button separately or at least give the option. Also make the side quest more satisfying. Just giving me commons just isn't going to work. Please nerf the herlad faction. 1 its crit chance is to stupidly high 17 percent is to much. Its also so quick and has long range",
        "Would be great if there were a better sign in feature. I had to restore factory settings on my phone... Now the game won't allow me to log into my account. Which sucks a lot, I have spent money on microtransactions and a bit of time into leveling up. But now that seems to be all gone...",
        "The game is a lot of fun but there's one big problem the only way to advance in the story mode is by leveling up and getting better armor but the only way to level up is in story mode so your other option is spend real money on better equipment. So it's kinda just a money grab. If that was fixed I'd give it 10 stars",
        "The only good thing about this game is graphic and animation. Beautiful and smooth. But how about the Gameplay? Yuck! Lack of contents. Story goes nowhere. After several duel, you didnt gain anything. Which mean it stops you from progressing to follow the story. The only way to progress is spend money. There is even no option to delete/sell common chest or gear. In short, uninstall and find another game."

        "I really enjoy playing this game. It helps me to relax while I am watching TV, or even using in split mode while watching a video or something. It's a bit different then the way I originally used to play Klondike, but still a great game and easy to get used to quickly! I don't mind the 5 second or so ads between games. It's the price you pay to get a good, free game. It's not like they play constantly and during a game there is usually an ad on the bottom screen but it will quickly move if you go to start a new game or need to access the other options.",
        "It's a fun relaxing game. Its so addictive that every device I have, must have this game. I have it on my phone, ipad and tablet. Except my laptop cuz then I would get no work done. About the ads, one pops out each time you finish a game, so I'm not to bothered by it. Also, theres no videos too watch in order to earn coins or diamonds because none are needed. I just love it. Its stress free.",
        "I would have scored higher except there is suddenly super annoying music being played that there is no option to turn off. The ads also now autoplay loud music. I agree with another poster who said it starting to seem like you lose more so you see more ads. I liked this because it was good for a quick game while getting ready to sleep. The music ruins this. I'm going to try another app now.",
        "I love the game solitaire played it on many different computers over the years. Downloaded three other version on my phone. All of which I deleted almost straight away because they were finicky and I didn't like the format. This one is easy to use and no glitches. So far so good.",
        "It locks up whenever you hit the back key on your Android phone.  Have Samsung note 5 and as I hold it, the back button sometimes gets hit and it asks me if I want to exit the game or cancel.  When I hit cancel, nothing else works, can't move cards or select next 3 cards, except the bottom control buttons do work, so all you can do then is undo, or redeal. But even after an undo or redeal, you still can't play cards, it's unresponsive. All you can do is exit the game and restart to get it responsive again. Too frustrating to use.",
        "Terrible ads. So bad they hid the menu bar behind an ad banner so you click the ads just to access settings. Pretty sure they recently increased losing deal rate to make more ad videos play. So many other solitaire aps available so skip this one."

        "The movement and the ability to delete structures for refund could be better. Trading HQ could be so much better, my main concern are the loading screens. Perhaps instead of loading the whole city a separate map viewer could be opened that shows general statistics and layout but not the entire city. That way trading could be done faster between cities and there would be more involvement with the trading community. As it stands its a real chore and is deterring me from trading as much as I'd like. Another idea is if the stock market could be integrated somehow. I think that would be cool, and it would add an element of realism.",
        "Thanks for new upgrade . Even when the game was slow i didn't stop playing. I love this game. It's not only a game for me...i am a President of my club and i have to lead my members... in less than one year i reached level 50 and almost all land expanded...just  you have to understand how to play... be smart... some advice for beginners  start participate in mayor competition...this way you will grow faster",
        "This game is crazy addictive. But it's way too easy to accidentally spend sim cash when you don't want to. I save religiously and in half a second my finger brushes the wrong button and cash is gone just like that. Really disheartening.  Again I just accidentally spent sim cash. A lot of it and it took me months to save it. I think I'm officially done with this game.",
        "By a stroke of luck I got my old game back in February 2018 after a span of a year and a month. Good to be back. A suggestion : why don't you have something like a banking system wherein you can exchange the different currencies in play in the game. There could be a selling price and a purchase price which gives the bank a margin",
        "Great game. But what I miss are written below.   1. Direct search & contact any city.   2. Invite a city to be friend from within game.   3. Direct private message with a city from within Game.   4. Make a city tagged as favourite city or liked city.   5. Want a clean viewing mode of own city without those construction hats and other info symbols on top of  building being constructed.  I think they are massively missed. And if you can provide these facilities then it will be the best game of it's class.",
        "Addictive & fun.  In a perfect world: more land expansion is needed. Also, variable prices at the GTHC based on scarcity would be better than fixed ones based on difficulty to produce.  One important thing.  There is premium currency in this game.  It's very easy to accidentally spent it, as there is no confirm button on premium currency purchases.  Fix this and will give 5-stars again"

To test is on lvl 1 first corner accelerate and turn left (any set of controls tried all) it will start turning right seems to be when the prospective changes. Looks like it would be good if it went where you tell it to. Might be due to latest patch so will try again if it get fixed",
        "I hope in the new update you can upgrade the engine and body kits as well. That would bring back the fast and the furious Season 7 track 6 nexts to be check it says three lap but you are basicly doing lap 2 twice and it says wrong way. Third lap starts when u finish three laps and doing 4th lap counts as 3rd lap. Needs to be looked at this is cheating  u guys are doing",
        "I have a one plus 5T with 8 GB ram still the game hangs at the finish line and all my progress is lost. I have to restart the game to get it going. Please fix this I can sent you the screenshot is you want. I love your game and it would be great if these small thing is fixed swiftly !",
        "Awesome Game... no need to spend money to get best cards you can easily earn them... Can play offline too... There is a glitch though in season 7 - save 8 second stage... even after finishing it wont give 3 stars and fails me.",
        "Fix the detection when you touch/hit in perfect drift mode. There's been hundreds of times where ive definately not hit and yet it ends. So Infuriating, love the game but that one detail could definitely be optimized better. The drift should not end unless you actually hit and it screws up your direction. 4/5",
        "I love this game and so do all my mates. It dose have a few light glitches as most games do. I would love a night track of some kind in the future but other wise great game all together. Also out of all the drifting games this is the best one at of all of them."

Only thing to improve would be cheaper ingame currency to encourage more people to have better decks thus higher activity rates.",

There have been several updates that I love (the new maps, new sharks, equipment, etc.) and I'm glad I'm playing it now. In game currency price for items has been balanced out which I love and the missions system is much better now. I would highly recommend this game to anyone who likes progression-based time-killing games like Hungry Shark World.",
        "This game is amazing! Everyone needs to play this. I would've given a fifth star however you need to not only buy all XXL sharks to unlock the \"!!\" Sharks but max them out. Definitely download this, just one tip. Don't delete when you have progress. I've downloaded, played, got bored, and deleted 3 times. Now I'm never deleting it. I have so much progress, if I never deleted it the first time I would have everything in the game",
        "Favourite Shark game in the entire world. I became obsessed because it's so addictive and fun. The graphics are amazing, disappointed when I got my new phone I lost my progress even when I used the smart transfer to transfer the app. I've had to start all over again... but the fun continues!",
        "Do not upgrade your Sharks.  The bigger the shark, the more difficult it is to play.  Big sharks have more drain on health and hunger, causing you to die more frequently. Impassable areas due to size of !! shark and less fishes to eat when health gets low.  Not to mention how slow these big sharks move!  The more you spend on bigger sharks, the less fun you'll have.",
        "I've had to start this game all over from the very beginning 3 times. After working hard to get all the way to the top sharks, the app will suddenly refuse to connect to your Facebook account and want you to start a whole new game. Waste of time. Very frustrating. Not enjoyable at all. Find a game that's enjoyable. This one is definitely not fun.",
        "This game is really addictive and i love it but i own everything now so I don't play anymore. I occasionally get on just to check for new stuff and they do put out new stuff but it takes a long, loooonggggg time. Please put new sharks out and don't make us wait foreverrrr!"

        "So I love the app but in free mode it will let you play.missions.. In a couple of the missions I have noticed it has given me 200 passengers to bring to a airplane boat (forgot what its called) and you cannot land a plane big enough for 200 passengers on it! No room to land without the wing getting clipped off by the tower and no place to take off from it! Other than that it is an awesome game",
        "A really good game to play if your board and have nothing to do. Its proberly one of the best flight simulators on mobile devices ive ever played. The graphics are acctually really good for a mobile game that runs smoothly. The controles can somtimes be wonky but youll get used to it. I love to play this game i really enjoy. The best thing about it is that, its FREE! Good job 'fun games for free' üëèüëåüñí‚ò∫",
        "Was able to start playing right away because of the level of simplicity and yet you have to learn so you can challenge yourself in the more advanced campaigns that soon come up. The game will leave you finding out that a couple of hours has passed in a blink of an eye because of the fun you're having. I really just started the game so I will come back and update this in a few months as I advance in the game.",
        "I've been losing sleep for days now playing this incredible game. Hahaha! Great graphics, smooth controls, realistic sounds, and easy-to-navigate interface. It doesn't force users to pay real money to fully enjoy and access the game. I wish the game offers a first-person mode where you get to play inside the cockpit and navigate the aircraft. That would be so much extra fun! Hats off to the team behind the game's development! :)",
        "Pretty cool app. I'd like it more the planes/jets could be personalized with personal/or existing airline company names and if you could play commercial type flying modes. All without having to level up or earn money or pay real money for. Like a free fly mode. Oh,oh... and that there was real life situations that happen as a result of no fly zones and stuff. Otherwise it's pretty cool so far.",
        "This is the most addictive flight simulator I have ever played. The game is fairly easy to progress through without having to spend any money. If I had to find one fault it would be that you can't reverse when on a runway which means some times you have no option but to crash your plane as there is very little room to turn around."

        "This is all I needed: another Criminal Case game to take up my free time! I love the whole four of them. The the hidden objects tease my brain to no end. Each game  is intriguing with an original story line. I do have my favorite crime scenes,  and plenty of friends(all over the world) whom play as often as they can too!",
        "It would be nice if you level up and get full energy but your energy had some if not all left before you got it restored that you just increased by the full amount, the way it is now I lose energy when levelling up because it doesnt add any more to the 110 that is standard. I dont think it is fair to those of us who play daily. I never know when my pet will find that last batch of XP and cause the level up to happen. If I am over the 110 already, I don't even see the new energy. Some concessions need to be made for this. I love the game though, it is fun and challenging.",
        "I love this game. I have all of the criminal case games & love them all. The only things that I don't like is that when when ur energy gets refilled, it only adds to what u have, instead of adding an extra 110 to what u have. The other thing is that u can't buy none of the hamburgers, orange juice, chips or anything with ur tokens",
        "Love Criminal Case and a True Fan!! One thing I think should change is that whatever score you have when you level up, the 110 should be added to it. We deserve it  because we Earned it and the only reward we get is to share juice with other players. Give us a Happy Meal and 110 pts.!!",
        "4th instalment of the Criminal Case games. I love playing them all excellent time wasters intriguing story lines. I'm well & truly hooked on the whole series. Gainsborough, Pacific Bay, Save The World & now this Mysteries Of The Past........ all brilliant",
        "I've been addicted to the Original Criminal Case for a long time! I thought I would try this version! Just started & I'm already hooked! It's great fun! I Love all the old fashioned before the 20th century stuff! Can't wait to see what comes with the game!"

I was very happy when I found something I could upload...THIS GAME. its free and fun. Enjoy playing this! Thanks for reading.",

Can't you see the game creator worked hard just in order to entertain you and you repay them with complaints on not knowing how to play?What if you created a game and others complain not knowing how to play? Is that nice?(Not to offend) thank you",

        "The game is alright, but I  have some frustrations with it. For one, sometimes when you release the ball, the aim will move suddenly and cause it to hit off of your intend target. Also, it isn't cool when you start a new level and you have no available moves (you can't pop any bubbles! ), Sometimes for a number of turns, sometimes in the middle or at the end of the level. Usually it is manageable enough. Still frustrating tho. Maybe it is an international challenge of the game..  Overall a decent game",
        "Uninstalling. The controls are imprecise (ball would slip off the desired direction occasionally) and the order of the colours would make it impossible to win on occasion. I can forgive the first thing (muscle) but making it impossible to win is not forgivable.  Work on the algorithm.",
        "I used to enjoy this game when I had a minute spare. I was cruising at around level 300 enjoy the simplicity of it but not anymore! Since the introduction of the \"ice\" balls, it's become near impossible. Reading the other comment I'm glad to see that others are frustrated with the aim moving right at the last minute. I had this at 5 stars now it's 1.",
        "Games really nice good mind challenge, great for color match making if color blind. You may not know what colors your matching however, ever since i started playing i've also been getting better at matching my clothes and random day to day organising of colored items. Love the game however the ball simetimes seems to go where it wants to instead of where you released it... I noticed this a few times i would aim let go and the line would randomly jump to a new spot and the ball shots almost a completely diffrent location",
        "It is a good game but is built to take $$.  There are some levels that will not let you pass without spending $$ which I refuse to do.   I understand the need to make $$, but when it is blatantly built to take money, that is where I have an issue.  I wish I could upload the video of the level this takes place in, then you would understand what I mean. Decent game but sad for the obvious reason for the game.",
        "Best goddamn game I've ever played, most amazing graphics in the entire gaming world! I'm thinking of naming my next kid Power Pop. I didn't believe in God until I discovered this life changing game."

        "Good I hope they fixed the bug where you double buy a car and it gives you the same car but still takes your money. But its still a great game. Ohh! And also raise thr chance if getting a legendary I played for almost a year and I never got one l. My friend got one all the time on his apple but there Is a glitch with android.ive never had one.",
        "It's good but... I enjoy playing this game, there isn't too much skill involved but it's a good way to kill time and it stays easy enough to make it enjoyable while raising the difficulty.  The only thing I want to see is no more of this, automatically backing up stuff. When you are nose first in an object, the game automatically backs you up, but I've lost countless games because it doesn't stop or doesn't back up enough. Let me choose when to back up!",
        "Good but... you can sometimes glich and get trapped but it's a good game anyway like you run from police. Also when you start off you have to press right or left to start so you can't go straight forward when you get on. I really liked it though it is one of my favourite games! I'm out  Later ima go play some Smashy Road now!",
        "Good, but has some bugs I'm sorry if I'm being too critical in this review but especially on Mobile Data, Smashy Road can lag. This is to the extent the game will no longer work. Moving on to a positive, the graphical interface is very nice, the perspective, movement and background vehicles is very well created.  Very good game overall",
        "Shalom there, The game is awesome. I liked it very much and hoping that in the future they will be more cars to be added. I really hope that \"military helicopter\" can shoot something, it is funny...so idle. Last thing, a HOVERCRAFT can go \"river mode\" ! Wrecked... because of...water. Hope you'll add the \" police boats \" in next update. Overall, abundant of thanks and good luck.",
        "I LOVE THIS GAME. It just need's some work to do. Like, you guys need to fix the glitch of the lines by the road. And you need to fix when we explode the oil truck and fall on the ground and you disapear. And can u guys please add some new prizes like to change the color of ur car. And when I have 100 dollars u can spend it on colors  theirs a button to choose what prize you want. Like say I get the color blue for a red car. And I like the red car so I go to the prize machins and choose to buy a color than I have the button to change the color of ur car. That will make the game a lot better. And I'm sure when u do it there will be more downloads."

        "RESUBMITTED: Arena games were sucked up by those high-card players or maybe cheaters. My power cards are the same, just like my opponent, or higher than my opponent's cards. When I slinging those piggies or blocks, it gives me lower points like 4 hundred thousand. But if my opponent slinging them all, it gives higher points like 7.5 million. I lost my winning streaks so I had to play again but it gives me same points so I lost again, sadly. I thought your arena games are really much fun, but they're not.",
        "GAH! They've over complicated this game with unnecessary graphics and gifts and prizes etc. I couldn't even figure out how to get into the levels for a while haha. I'm sure if I had the patience to go through and understand it properly it would be fine, but I didn't want to. Old angry birds setup was better. Wish you didn't change it. Uninstalled after 1 day.",
        "I really think the tower is rigged. 1 in 4 chance of getting the pig but it seems to happen ALL the time. Cant get past the 6th or 7th floor. However if you spend lots o money to buy gems I guess it can be done. Not for me I am out.",
        "Broken game mechanics. unstable. Repeated crashes during tournament resulting in instant loss. unbreakable pig structures added. Big Red and bomber unable to break glass? Next level tab covered up by fb connect tab. Game has become a disgusting money grab."

Balls are never randomized, there are no circular objects for the balls to bounce off from and neither an infinite mode. Also you  have to get used to the controls. Would be nice to turn off the help lines, too.",

Though there are many glitches in the game, this is the second time I'm gonna have to download because it won't open. Overall, it's a fun game when it's not glitching",
        "Garbage game,is now infinitely looping on a challenge tournament. Once I defeat the first opponent the screen goes black and the game freezes. Reopening the game puts me back in the same match and ends in the same endless loop.   Dev team needs to fired and a patrol of lemurs hired instead because they'd at least be entertaining.",
        "As much as I love Beyblade, this app is really disappointing. The gameplay isn't anything special but the worst is the players. There should be a serious punishment for disconnecting. I cannot enjoy the game - I should have won two matches but I got nothing for them because my opponents disconnected the last second. Truly unsatisfying.",
        "Good game but add sprizen s4 and if you could be able  to controle were the beyblade goes and add a swordlauncher when is battle tower stadium cooking out and when is luinor L3  coming and the digital control coming out and if is possible add ring out finish and when theirs a draw that no one gets points instead and some more stadiums more speshol moves for beys but stell love the appüëçüëçüëç",

        "You really don't do anything but press orbs and press to buttons. Plus, just to get cool stuff, you need to go out and buy only beyblade bursts. The game is boring and confusing."

        "I love Beat the Boss 4! But there are some things that I would like to be fixed. For example, when naming your custom boss, the name duplicates. The way to fix it is by putting spaces after it. Another example is that the boss customization screen sometimes switches back to boss selection screen and can't go back after being there for long periods of time. I would love to give this game 5 stars if these issues were fixed.",
        "I loved it. I understand the ads are so that you can continue your work. However, there is a few probelms. First of all, when you click on the judgey/uneven eyes, they change to even eyes. Second of all, when you click on a custom character, the game doubles the name, and following along with that, sometimes it undoes it. I understand if it takes a long time, but i'm asking you, if you can, to please fix these when you can. Sorry for bothering you.      Doge is waiting",
        "Too many ads. It's annoying especially when you are connected to the internet. The King Boss is not working and is always saying \"Something went wrong, please try again later\" and crashes the whole gane. On the other hand it's a super addictive and fun game to play.",
        "This game needs a lot of work done. So many glitches its really weird and hard to explain the glitches that happen. One of them was the screen uncalibrated itself an it was moved to the upper left side , an the right side was just black . idek if that makes sense but it shouldn't happen.",
        "The game is amazing, but it is pathetic at the fact that there are ads popping up every 2 minutes and there's no way to remove them... I would be happy to pay to remove the ads, I won't be playing this game until this is fixed. I remember playing this game years ago, I understand you guys may be making more money from displaying ads than people paying to remove them.",
        "I'd happily purchase this game but that doesn't seem like an option. Tge ads, especially the LOUD BLOW UP EXPLOSIONS game that go on for 30 seconds are especially annoying. I'll gladly buy it, if only to not deal with Fing ads all the Fing time!!"

But if this is it? Kudos to you guy's on a job well done!",

        "The responsiveness of the controls I  this game make it unplayable... it's slightly more responsive than the original sonic dash but it's still no where near good enough for such a fast paced game.  I tested this on other devices before I posted this review and it's the same on all of them",
        "I would give it 5 stars, I made an in app purchase to remove ads, but after the game updated non Sega ads started showing again and it asked me to make another purchase in order to remove the non Sega ads AGAIN... love the game, hate the ads...",

        "I have loved Hot Wheels for years and this is a good game. Fun and challenging. However I have been a bit frustrated because sometimes I just explode for touching a wall like on level 6. Awesomeüòí Not to mention I sometimes just hit a ramp and don't reach the end and fall into a void. Also fix your Poppa Wheelie's handling. You killed it, literally. Just try and fix your game a bit and I will give a 5.",
        "Horrendous abuse of in game ads like I've never seen before in an app. At some points, you literally cannot proceed until you open the play store. The game races are short balancing acts wherein you simply try to keep your car on its wheels. Do not download, and do not let your kids start playing.",
        "My 2 almost 3 year old and I really like this game. It's pretty fun BUT it seems to freeze up after a few races and I have to shut the game off and restart it to play more. This obviously frustrates little man and I'm sure I'm not the only one this has happened to. Other than that, we think it's a great game.",
        "Lost all in app purchases which amounts to stealing. Beware of doing in app purchases. Way to many ads. App also crashes a lot. Support said they would help then didn't respond after that. If my son was able to lose his progress and the money we sunk in the game because he was using multiple devices and didn't know what Cloud and Local meant which cause him to lose his progress then mabe this game shouldn't be labeled E for Everyone. Change the rating to Teen if they have to know what cloud means or risk losing there in app purchases.  Google change the rating on this game.",
        "I've been playing this app for a while now and up intil now I loved it but ever since the daily race-off challenge the game has been full of bugs. The daily race-off is a great idea but there are just too many bugs in it. I lose lives when I didn't even lose the race or I lose all my lives when I only lost one race.",
        "The game is my little boys favourite but the recent batch of adverts in game (Yahoo specifically) don't close - meaning you have to force quit the game. Lazy programming and terrible QA process from the developers. Avoid."

There are no way of earning diamonds to play the game other than buying them. I'd like to see more ways of earning tickets rather than buying or just waiting for it to regenerate. I'd also love to hear the characters speak.",
        "It is addicting! I love the graphics and how everything plays out! You are always hanging on edge, biting your nails and wondering, 'Whats gonna happen next?' Over all its awesome. Sometimes there are glitches but apart from that 5/5!",
        "This is by far one of the best choices games I think I've ever played the graphics and animation is absolutely second to non, the story so far seems awesome and intriguing. The animation is beautiful and smooth and runs well on my phone. Please never change the way this game is. It gives you the option to buy things but it is very fair to those who can't pay due to money issues so I would definitely recommend this game. The developers should be proud of this game because it really is beautiful designed and made you can tell alot of care and effort went into perfecting this game. It's worth the wait on each episode, I love the stats from other players feature and how you can go back for free to see how different choices would of effect the game differently. All round a very professionally well built game 10 out of 10 wish I could give it more stars it deserves more than 5 :D.",

        "I'm loving these updates really bring more life to the game. The new car is really fun because it can flip over really easy. Please don't change that. A few suggestions: When you go to winter wonderland you can't go back. Would be cool if car panels would become detached like the hood or the trunk. Adding a police cruiser would be cool too. I like the breakable rear lights on some of the cars. Maybe add deflatable tires? Very good game all in all",
        "This game is fun and entertaining and you can test drive all the vehicles which make it quite cool. Wish there was a camera view which you could zoom out so you can see from a better angle of all those around you. Reversing auto changes the camera. Some times multiple simultaneous button clicks don't work. And I wish they had one of my favourite cars here, the Lamborghini Sesto Elemento",
        "Its a very addictive and also a great time killer would like to see a spoiler selection for the cars. My favirote car is fury. I would like to see a (1963 Ferrari 250 gto WITHOUT smoke stacks) the thing i dont like about the game it is not letting me into the city i bought it and i tried over and over again but its not letting me its gliching a lot and exits me out of the game other than that it is a great game would like to see some new buses and trailers for  the semi's out in test trive mode and a new land area in the mountains.",
        "I had loved this game until it stopped saving my car purchases. Like my last  one the pick up that looks exactly like a 80s chevy with the cap off and roll cage. I put 7.0 motor in it with NOS tires and paint. Went in this morning it was gone. Please fix.Norton also says you're monitoring my location how obtrusive you dushbags.",
        "This game is awsome!  Controls and graphics can be a little laggy,  but the large amount of tracks and cars to unlock and play around with makes up for it. My favorite car is the Duke Wagon Classic, nitro-charged, with a v-8 dropped into it.  Will kick butt in any race or derby! My only suggestion would be on the physics of the cars... Instead of having the bodies simply crush and get smaller/deformed, it would be cool to see body panels and  small pieces like lights and mirrors fall right off. Just a thought. Also it would be cool to have more big station wagon type cars.",
        "Need a 67 Shelby mustang gt 500 fastback \"Eleanor\". Also needs a hand brake for sharp turns and drifting and maybe an inside view with steering wheel and stick shift. Very fun and addicting game. Great job here. Multi-player would be cool too."

        "The thing that makes this game great is the visuals and the audio. It is absulutley beautiful and the art style works so well with the type of game. Without this the game would not be nearly as good as the game play I'd very simple but it would still do ok. However these features are what makes the game. Also the fact that there's a night and day feature gives the game an even bigger opportunity to show the beauty of its art style",
        "Alright, so the game is pretty good. All I ask for is more tricks, and the ability to upgrade some bonuses (coin magnet, feather hover thing, and the third one that I haven't grabbed yet.) All in all, if you could do that, it'd make the game so much greater. Apart from skipping missions and revives there's no use for coins.",
        "Good graphics, but can get boring after only like 3 minutes. Also the makers of the game should add a another different mode where your running away from a villager/camper and see how far you can get. You could improve or modify this mode that i have made if you want",
        "This was the must have game- I think, for a while. Then the newest update came out. Now it has ads you must veiw (before totally optional for more coins or an extra run) and added FTP elements. Took from a 5 star classic, to barely 2 stars. Thankfully, the base game play was untouched, and still well worth the advertisements, but I'm very sad for this move on the part of the dev team.",
        "I have 'noisy' brain and anxiety and sometimes the world is too much to bear. This game keeps me calm and collected all the time. The music and gameplay soothe me up. I do get frustrated over the goals but I have nothing but praise and love for this game. Thank you to everyone involved. You all helped a lot. Cannot wait for Alto's Odyssey for Android!",
        "The game is addictive, but i cannot play it more than 10 minutes at a time, because it gets boring. The awful part is that since 1 week, i dunno why, it crashes while i'm playing.. Anyway, it's addictive because after you start playing, you start thinking about it while you're not playing"

        "What a great game it is like a scaled down but easier version of ksp. Would love to be able to dock with other ships in orbit though. Also u should add a rover that can be launched off a ship and used to explore planets. On top of that u could create landmarks on planets such as caves or something! Overall a great game but would love to have more content! P.S any estimated date for when next update comes out?",
        "I got to the Moon my second launch! Fun game for doing a launch while waiting for the bus etc. It's simple and I like it! Couldn't figure out how to decouple my boosters simultaneously. Very nice work on this app! It's KSP but mobile version very cool! The music is cool too! My suggestion is to add some reentry heat affects, more sounds like parachute opening sound, etc but I'm sure that's on your list.",
        "So I've been playing the game for a couple of months now. i think that there is an awesome game here, with already plenty to do. I do also think that there is lots of room and need to improve upon this. As I have been playing for a while, I do notice it becomes quite challenging to escape orbit with enough fuel to make it to other planets, like mars. i do recommend you add a cheats section that you can enable in the settings, with unlimited fuel, larger build space, indestructable rockets, etc. I also recommend more bits and pieces for building, like bigger and more powerful thrusters, or air vents for turning in space. For later development, a satellite system would be much appreciated, as well as a little spaceman that you can control when docked at a space station, or when you're on a planet. Thank you for an awesome game!!!",
        "I landed on the Moon and... I got back to Earth safely on manual control! What's with you, you think I'm expendable?! There is no way to add new destination once the original one is attained. Also it would be great to have a payload that can be carried other then the capsule alone. Other than this is the greatest fun I had in a while.",
        "I love this game, i've been landed surface in every celestial object few times, included Sun. I also recommendation to other friends in forum to play it.  But, I want suggest to add some simulation like : - Rotation planet. - Perihelion/Aphelion. - Perigee/Apogee.  And also some feature : - List for delete few space trash like empty booster in orbit. - Name rocket every launch (it make fun & realistic).  Thank You",
        "I am so addicted to this game. I love everything about it. I just wish there was a place to donate to you (developer). Also, I would love it if there were more rocket parts. Also, I wish there was a thermosphere you had to get through to get on planets. All in all, I love it! Can't get enough!  Edit: Thank you so much for the reply. I'm sorry I wasn't clear on the thermosphere part, but i think the reentry effect would be lovely. I just can't stop playing. And I'm SOOOO excited about rovers and things! Thank you so much again! :)"

Do you expect me to have patience with this game? I hope not because I have no patience and this game totally pushed me to the limit and put me off playing on my tablet. If you do not want to be annoyed please don't get this app and if you do delete it straight away in my opinion. ( I don't mean to be rude but this game makes me very angry.) THE END!!!!!!!!!",

It keeps me entertained while I am bored or when I am on the bus on my way to school. But there are way to many ads and I hope u guys please fix that. üíú",

        "It's honestly a fun game, and I'd love to use it as a stimulating activity (ah, who am I kidding, it's just a great time killer), but it makes my head hurt-- and that's a problem. I'm not even the type of person that is negatively affected by fast-paced graphics or rapidly changing colors. It'd be five stars if it didn't give me headaches, but, for now, it gets three; good graphics, smooth gameplay, but no matter how great the app, it isn't worth physical discomfort. (Note: if you are looking for something similar, try \"Run\". It has the same sort of concept, but without the advertisements and headaches.)"

        "I like this new update. Hanks now have His own happy meter like Tom and Angela. Nice. Also this is just my suggestion. Can you guys also make My Talking Ben and My Talking Ginger. Those two deserved their own My Talking games. Also can you guys add more money to Tom cause He always have just one big gold coin and that's it. You know Angela have plenty of gold coin even Hanks have three. It's not fair. Lastly good job guys.",

Talking games are good but hank is not üò´üò´ please let hank good not like a road dog please .üò´üò´üò´üò´",

Vikings is not a bad game on itself but I feel cheated when I'm promised something and IronSource does not honor their part of the bargain. IronSource said the Plarium did not verify my completion of the offer, so I won't play it anymore nor try other Plarium content nor IronSource advertised games. The actual content is fine, but the business practices are deplorable.",
        "Great time killer, I love the interaction and concept of the game. It can get a bit laggy at times and at it's worst, it will crash on you. The wait times are unbearable though. No ads at all since the first time I played too!",
        "Too late to join this game. As soon as you lose your newbie protection you become a farm for higher level players, preventing you from progressing. Every morning you find all your resources pillaged and your troops dead or incapacitated. Maybe I'm just in the wrong timezone.",
        "The game has the same problems as the other versions. The events boost strong players which makes the gap in strength larger. The premium items are overpriced. Probably the worst I have seen, there is no protection for your silver. This means stronger players always have a reason to attack someone weaker and there is no protection in place after being successfully attacked.",
        "The game itself is great. Zero complaints there. But the fact that it I am unable to ever log in is infuriating. I've literally been zeroed out because the app won't let me log in... multiple times. It's absolutely ridiculous. Needs to be fixed."

        "Do not spend any money on this game. This used to be one of the best slot games until the developers got greedy. Payouts are small and events are nearly impossible. They try to make it all sound good but it's not. They also changed the customer service on here where it's hard to get anyone. You cannot message them on Facebook if you have a problem and if you say anything negative about the game you will be blocked. Hope this review saves some of you some time so you can find a better game!",
        "I have played this game for many months I have purchased and yet with all the updates you all do it keeps getting worse the payouts on the slots are horrible. The group event games are picked I think to take all our chips so we will be forced to buy I believe that until you make the payouts on the slots better you are going to lose a lot of customers.",
        "Love the casino games it offers and the league I'm on.  But huuuge has made changes to the game which makes it harder to get puzzles and always trying to sell chips  lottery tickets just to play constantly and it's frustrating other than that I love the game.  Use to be easy to get puzzles and be fun to play it's becoming about money for Huuuge always selling or you have to buy something..",
        "This is an interesting game. It doesn't give you all the bonuses, and it takes gifts and doesn't give them to the gamers you gave it to. So all in all it's just okay. I've never been able to get anywhere with their support team as the add to my reply. I'd give it a one star but I like playing with what they give me free.",
        "I love this app I have fallen  in love with it over and over again. ..I just  wish that payouts would be better and jackpots more frequently.  This is pure logic  huge or billionaire  casino..  you let us win big make us happy few days later we loose it anyway no one looses right? It's a cicle keep us the client happy and we for sure will come back every time.Its fake chips not real  guys. .  please give us a reason to come back for more. So sad I deleted  both my apps. When I go there I want  be happy not worry that my 17.7b will be gone in 60seconds playing Roulette",
        "I urge people to stay as far away as possible from this 1! They are robbing lying cheating scumbags, using illegal and and fraudulent tactics to get money from your bank account in to theirs! Such as offering deals and then not giving you what you have paid for! Investigation underway!"

        "This game is good but the walls aren't solid as I am constantly wall banged, the damage isn't consistent as I keep getting one shotted but can't deal the same damage, the weapons of the dead don't appear on the ground and don't stick around for long enough to actually use them or pick them up and the granade button is unresponsive if you're about to die.",

Maybe every 40 levels add a mill purchase option. When selling on the market, we need an option for a blind add or a neighborhood only sell or trade.. make these upgrades and so far game would be perfect!",
        "It's great to be able to buy from other farms in theory. But there are WAY too many times that you click on something and it's either sold or not even in the roadside stand at all. The for sale paper needs to update quicker.  Also, it's very hard to accumulate any 'west bucks' in this game and you need them to do almost anything, so the game is a big money suck too. I'm deleting it.",
        "I love these type of games just like hayday. I have noticed it freezes and takes ages to load the newspaper. Also would be helpful if it could tell you who needs help in the newspaper would help filling orders quicker. Also I have noticed alot of people selling the same parts and harder to get others and it's extremely rare to get the land parts without paying",
        "The game doesnt give enough case vs things to buy or fix.  Also have issues with getting product into the alloted spaces.  I thought it was my screen but had it cleaned thoroughly and it still happens.  It takes several attempts!!!  The story is cute.  The graphics are cute as well.  Ive noticed it has a couple of choices from other games Ive played on older phones. I would suggest the game to others but get the issues fixed and itll be a 5star game.",
        "I love playing these games. I'm not sure why we are rating gameplay they offer apps not a game. It's crazy how they ask us to rate game at the beginning of game. We haven't learned the bad points. This game makes us pay for treasure chest instead of giving us to them free like most games. Which means we have to pay for everything. Totally not fair. Takes the fun out of game.",
        "Was totally looking forward to playing this game, the graphics were so cute that I couldnt help but download, but I havent even gotten past the tutorial and its frozen? The game started panning to the billboard right after you sell your first visitor the cream and then it just froze and now it won't let me continue on."

If you want more people to buy the game you have to give them the opportunity to play without being interrupted every death. Your game can be the best ever but still no one will play it if they have to invest the same time in watching ads that they invest in playing the game.",
        "It's a great game, for users complaining about ads, it's called ad blocker. When devs force a billion ads and make it unplayable, I use adaway, game is great after, but without adaway, don't bother!",
        "Game is good. Ads are bloody appalling. I have to waste 30 seconds each time I die? No thank you",
        "Alright if you like ads more than gameplay. Stuck with 30 second ads after 20 secs of play. Don't mind some ads, but this is overkill. Pass.",
        "Edit: Ruined it because if the ads. I understand why you have them, but I was willing to watch them IF I felt like doing another round or not. Having the choice to watch one or not was nice. Now you're just forced to after death. Sorry, that's never a good idea. And no, save your copy pasted response, I don't want it. It's not genuine, and it's just a plead for us to buy the ad removal thing.  Original: The core gameplay loop is cool. It's fun, I'll keep booting it up. But it would benefit greatly by a better tutorial. As someone else said before, the ball tends to fly off and lose momentum in ways I can't seem to figure out. Might be a failing on my part, but at times it feels like gravity changes the rules at random and I'm left floating hopelessly as the void swallows me up. I'm not really sure what the optimal way to survive is",
        "The game itself is a lot of fun, it's challenging and addictive but with ads this game is a nightmare, they massively hinder your ability to progress and learn the game which is very frustrating. I made the in app purchase to remove the ads and without them the game is flawless. I think if the ads were reworked to be slightly less regular (i.e. not every time you lose) more people would be able to appreciate the game and might be more inclined to make the in aop purchase to remove them rather than getting annoyed at them before they've had a chance to enjoy the game."

        "It's nice game - very nice graphic, very smooth moving - it would be 5 stars. BUT - I payed for levels 13 and 14 , and the game does not allow me to play in random order - it's not possible to play no. 23 without finishing all numbers before. If you are stuck in some number, you cannot go to another one - you MUST BUY hint!!! It means - you PAID for the game, but you MUST PAY again for hint - or you are blocked in PAID  game. It's just not fair.",
        "A lot of Numberlink programs have \"fake\" puzzles - they have multiple solutions unless additional non-standard \"rules\" are followed... which are NEVER fun. This app doesn't do that. These are the real deal, and are VERY satisfying to solve. The price is extremely low for the quantity and quality on offer; I highly recommend this game.",
        "I loved flow free from a young age. I've played until 9√ó9 pack but when I reached a certain level,  the game stopped working after that and I've tried over and over again to go in but the game just keeps bring me back to the home screen and keeps stopping. Please fix it. I really want to play the remaining levels and packs",
        "Great game. Keep coming back to it. I find it relaxing solving the puzzles, though it has become super easy! All versions are great. All in all, awesome job! One of my favourites, and works in any situation. Quick break at work, something productive ? Play. Something to do before sleep? Play. Got a few extra mins? Play! Wanna challenge yourself on timed? Play! Haha.",
        "Was a great game until about 48 hours ago. I didn't mind the ads but now after every level I complete there's a video ad. Even then I would deal with it but it closes my music player. So after the ad I have to go to the music player and start it again but then when I switch back to the game I have to relaunch and reselect the level. Gets annoying to have to do after every level",
        "Edit: New horrible LOUD advertising you can't stop. Very disturbing to others and prevents usage around others.   Great puzzle games, lots of levels from easy to very hard. However it will eat your battery like there is no tomorrow. If your phone is plugged in, it will overheat. Use for more than about 15 minutes and your phone will burn your hand and shut down."

        "Excellent game! I have no doubt that the game is one of the most perfect games. Everything but one thing. I just ran one race that comes with the actualization and I won around 5k, te first upgrade for the camaro Nascar costs around 130k does that even make sense. In the real life if you spend that money to make a competitive car to win that money... I hope you get my meaning",
        "Good game, good graphics,good sound. I like that it is on going, not like some similar games. I found it fairly easy to get used too. Plenty of choices and cars. I like that you are not constantly forced to spend real money in order to progress. That is a big plus for us game players. Well done all at EA, you have a real winner with this game. I personally am loving playing this game. Update, I have been playing for a few days now, the only drawback I have noticed is, the game takes up a lot of space on my device. Having said that, its so good its worth it. As previously, well done all at EA.",
        "The MOST AMAZING racing game in the mobile device. The gameplay, graphics, and the controls were perfect. Also, the tracks in the game were so real like I was racing in real life. I also loves the cars that were added in this game, it looks so amazing. But, what I like the most from this game was online real-time racing. There were no other racing games that has this feature. Just have suggestions, add custom race mode. In this mode, you can chose tracks, daytime, amount of opponents, and also the laps. And also enable to invite friends to custom race mode. Also, probably adding weather system will be better. Last, make the cars could do rev-bombing. So, at the start of the races, you could have some pretty good start. Although, keep it up Electronic Arts & Fire Monkeys. Hopefully, these suggestions could help the game become much better and better.",
        "Well,to start off, game really speaks for itself.Everything is pretty dope. I'm just going to name some things that I'm sure most of the people wants. -Dynamic weather conditions,how amazing snow day on Bathurst would be?Rain,wind,foggy... -Breakable parts, mirrors, spoilers,even wheels,and those should be on the tarmac whole race. -Drift events, I'm just going to say,we all want it. -More hatchbacks definitely,and more cars like its Jeep,or Ford Raptor,and you can add unique cars from movies,etc. -And sprint events,point to point.How fun is that. -More mountains!!! Please. Peace!",
        "It's a great game where you can race and customise your own car. However here are some ideas I would like you the imlament please  1. If the cars from the NASCAR can get the custmizeing like all the others.   2. To extend the custmize can yo add a tab where you can put spoilers, air intakes And other things you would put on a car.  3. Finally to make this game real racing 3 if when a race of just go to see all the car you have.  There be a \"i\" button that will give the player real information about the car the player is looking at.",
        "Absolutely amazing game!!! I'm a huge petrol head and this ticks all boxes considering it's a phone game. Love the controls. Personally i use accelerator on right, brake on left and tilt to turn. Feels bang on. Graphics top notch. No need to spend money to progress. Literally one downfall... upgrade costs when you get higher spec cars. Apart from that... GOOD JOB!!!"

It makes my phone slow and all this might just be my opinion but it really is a terrible game that I wouldn't recommend. One game everyone should get if they, yunno, ACTUALLY WANT FUN NON-VIRUS GAMES, is hellopets. And BTW sorry for the grammar and stuff I don't wanna go back and fix it.",

        "Great game! Love to play it. Had 1 problem so far. Was playing a battle ship. Was rammed by a destroyer... Had all my guns on him. His ship went OVER mine which meant all my guns were now facing the wrong way. He on the other hand torp'd me to death....",
        "Okay, the torpedo issue is a bit better now, we can enjoy this game more. But DD is still OP. Anyway, your next homework is how the ship move. We talk about another player ship that play with us not ship that we drive. Their move is rather like a truck than a ship.  They have to move like our ship,  the stern drift first, right.",
        "DDs are OP as heck, torpedoes detonate meters away from the ship (useless trying to dodge between them) and all ships seem to float like UFOs which makes it very difficult to predict where you need to aim in advance.  I really wnt to like this game and see it become better but currently it has many teething issues.",
        "The game is a joke, cuz 1. the time is too short, 2. Maps are tiny, we meet enemies face to face 3. Nothing like the pc version 4. Needs all the ships got on pc version 5. ship turning is picullier to physics. 6. Low exp reward. Much lower.",
        "Good game, perfect for long term play both at home and work. Only complaint is torpedoes are over powered and hit box too large. That's why I give it 3 stars",
        "Very good engaging gameplay. I think destroyers are a bit op. Maybe battleships and cruisers should have aim assistant like destroyers have... Because sometimes it really painful to lose against one pesky destroyer :) or maybe limit them like 2-3 per battle or something. When you see 4 or 5 of them and you are in a battleship then it's no fun :) other than that it's a great game."

Making one mistake at lvl 190+ and then having to go back to zero was so frustrating it was the main reason i uninstalled.  Terrible shame honestly, the game could have been really fun and is an original idea"

        "I'm really fond of this game and love the gameplay and quick paced matches. The new update is AMAZING!   There are a few things that would make this game extra perfect for me!   Must have character customisation. This would be amazing to me. Char customisation makes me bind more to certain characters. The rings we get don't have much value to them except for upgrading the characters.  Could have non-ranked matches. I would love the option to play/practice against rivals or my own friends.   Should have quick chat responses. Would like to communicate before and after the match with simple reactions. Like Good luck and I win, tee-hee!",
        "To many ads unless you make some kind of purchase. Loading screens seem to take longer than I'd like. You can't at this time play with friends as Opponents are automatically chosen. There is still some characters ability noise in the game even if you have music and sound off. I'd like to see characters abilities not to be so similar, but it isn't taking away from the game at the moment for me. With all that said though the graphics are great, the game is fun, and it's worth the $1.99 purchase I made.",
        "This is one of the best mobile games I have played I a while. I probobly have a bias sense I love Sonic so much. However, if one thing could be added I would say it should be a converter for the Red Star rings to normal rings. Unless you want them to be payed for. I don't really care either way I'll just buy the Red Star rings but I brought up that idea because I currently have 23,000 rings just kinda waiting to be spent. Maybe incorporate phone backgrounds or some customizations for the game that cost extra rings? Thankyou so much for the new update and if anyone I'd debating on installing it just get it. You'll have fun, trust me.",
        "It's basically Sonic Dash PVP mode. But that doesn't change the fact it's fun. Love the steady support of adding new characters and how every character feels unique despite everyone playing the same (sounds weird but you'll understand after you play it) my only gripe is that when I want to play I have to start the app, close it, then restart again otherwise it never loads",
        "A fun premise ruined by a horrendous match making system,  ridiculous  unlocking time gates, and obvious pay to win incentives.  You'll be constantly matched with players with levels far higher than your own and the rewards are minimal for the all the effort.  The constant ads that play after every match is beyond irritating.",
        "Love the game, but there's something wrong.. Well... I think Cream is kinda rigged. Her items are a bit OP for the other players which makes it an easy stage into a extremely hard stage. And also, the deduction of trophies in 4th place is too much! Please make it lower (like maybe at around 5 or 8) and change the deduction of trophies in 3rd place 0 (These are all just suggestions I have). If you read this SEGA, your games are great and keep up the good work!"

        "This game deserves to be the best game of the year. Its so simple and yet mesmerizing. It is also very fast so you won't get frustrated and could play this game for hours (or until the fuel runs out :-P). This game is quite exciting and the visuals are also nice. This game deserves more than 5 stars. The music blends in quite well and jobs make it more fun. Their are many sources from which you can get rewards which makes it easy and challenging to play. I love this game. Also you can buy more fuel slots in the shop for 100 diamonds. Its expensive but I don't need it beacuse I have to keep track of the time and only play until the fuel runs out.",
        "For a shoot 'em up racing android game it's really addictive. I'm always playing it. It's fun. My only complaint is the time it takes for the fuel to charge, 30 mins? Come on! Otherwise very challenging. Challenge accepted!",
        "I really enjoyed this game until it started crashing mid game. Happened to me just recently and I wasted all my available fuel trying to frantically restart the game.  I was just completing the assigned jobs when the game suddenly stalled and I had to restart it again just to find it stalling again, all the while consuming the fuel with each restart. Hope to see this problem rectified soon, otherwise it's an enjoyable game nonetheless.",
        "Not too bad. I would have like to see the car while playing, and the graphics could be a touch better. I would honestly like an option between dragging your finger and using buttons on either side of the screen. That alone would have given this a 5-star rating from me",
        "I enjoy playing the game. I gave you 2 stars because of one thing: the fuels are gone after I open my data connection even though it just got 5/5. Can domebody please tell me where did the fuels go.."

        "LOVE IT! Im drowning in nostalgia for bomber man all over, it's absolutely fantastic. PLEASE release an update for power up crystals though! I'd love to fuse colours to create new crystals or just fuse the diamond cut gems to create even better power ups. It's just gotten to a point where i can't get any better crystal upgrades than what I have, and stagnance can be very boring! Cant wait for future updates üòÅüòÅüòÅ !! See you in the arena online ü§£üëãüëã",
        "Great game buuuut. Needs more game modes more powerful, target is more. Take the Nintendo game on the switch (also on wii) Bomberman as inspiration. Improve graphics. Add a game mode in which you have to find as many of something as you can to win. Add heat seeking missile that chases you (and that if hits walls will be destroyed.) Add more hairstyles, let us choose eyebrows, also add a new body type (like giant is one) a realistic one that looks good slimmer and more of a hot than the regular cute u got. Oh yeah and add friending so u can see their stats and profile and also just go into the same game instead of asking them what they are in. Maybe add followers and chatting when not in match also player can choose who joins game and who not. Any way this game is really fun and a great timekiller thx field making BTW if u take on any if these ideas thx and be sure to give me a mention!",
        "Love this game brings back memories. People moaning about the adverts when there isn't even that many! Updating now and hopefully it fixes people being able to walk over my bombs when I block them in, them glitches got quite annoying",
        "Too much hacking going on in the game. It's not enjoyable with hackers doing whatever they want.  *Update*  THE HACKERS GET ALL THE PACKS FOR FREE DONT WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS GAME BUYING PACKS. You're aware of this and still people have to pay for packs. That's stealing money from people who are buying something that the majority of players hack to get anyways free of charge. So why are you even charging for packs when people hack all of them anyways??? It's unfair and wrong. It's been 3 months and nothing else has been done about the hackers in the game.  Why is it that a 12 year old can hack your game but you can't do anything to stop them?",
        "Thank you for your response, I truly appreciate it! It took me a while to find the settings menu, but it held all of the options that covered my concern. Again, thank you so much for taking the time in patiently responding to my review!",
        "Fantastic game but chat should be removed. To much racism, threats and bad language amongst those who like to troll. Quite disgusting really as i know several people who have reported this to the creator(s) and still it continues And hackers, that's a whole different story! Very slow to sort out problems, and when you do, it only lasts a couple of days. Definitely glad i uninstalledüôå ain't worth the hassle."

        "Loved this game. The game is so addictive and enjoyable. I think the best ever football game to come across. BUT I HAVE ONE PROBLEM WITH THIS GAME. AFTER BUYING COMPETITIVE SQUAD THE GAME BECOMES SO EASY SUCH THAT I WIN BY A MARGIN OF 10 GOALS PER GAME. SO KINDLY, KINDLY.. DEVELOP TWO LEAGUES WHERE TO WIN A GAME SOMEONE MUST SWEAT even if you have all players rated 90%.hope for consideration during next update.",
        "There's always a bug when there's about to be substitution of players causing the players in possession of the ball to run like headless chicken. Pls fix that. Add SULLEY MUNTARI of Deportivo La Coruna to the game pls. 'Need FTS18 with embedded dream league soccer ffs! Seems many players who have their current teams in the game are missing. Lawrence Ati of Sochaux in Ligue 1, Joe Dodoo, and many more. A quick update with massive changes will be great 'cause the game currently sucks!!!",
        "DLS is one of the best games on Android. Just need some improvement in training mode, Training is full of bugs. And where is Ball change mode?? Please add new stylish Match Balls. AND PLEASE ADD NEW CELEBRATIONS IN NEW STYLE!! Need more realistic Gameplay. Really hope that you guys fix all small bugs soon. I'll rate 5 Stars!! ‚ù§üëèüëè",
        "Everything is good. But one thing. I have 6 created players in my team and I don't get new players for 5-6 season. Please make a \"Create a Player\" option under 'My Club' menu with more player editing options with a base rating of 60 or 70. Please add this feature then only I can create players same as the local leage in my region. It'd be so nice if you add that.",
        "It is a brilliant game absolutely loved it. But it cud add something first can it have every player's data like if i bought neymar then can it in records give his number of goals, assists, appearances and second after every player's stats that his pitch map how many interception he did and etc not just motm bur every player",
        "I will love it if i can send players on loan and be paid some coins instead of directly selling them off. Also switching players for a few or no coins will be great. Since players like pogba likes changing his hairstyles, it will also be great to effect some changes in some players hairstyle. More leagues are needed, if possible, German,  Chinese, Nigerian and south African league. Lastly, commentators find it difficult to call the name of a created player, work on these and this game will be perfect.  Thanks"

I've never run out of coins so I pretty much get to choose what I do and don't want to do which makes it really easy to heavily sway the odds in my favor. The ads crash a whole lot too which means I have to restart the app quite a bit. Other than that, I like the game",

        "My favorite puzzle/physics app. After I reached my goal of 3 stars on all the levels, I was sad my conquest was over. Then I discovered a whole other area of the app that consists of user created levels to solve. Now I've got new puzzles everyday thanks to the active fans in the brain-it-on community and I submit my own levels on occasion by using the level editor. If you like solving puzzles this is a great way to escape for awhile and exercise your brain at the same time.",
        "this game is so simple but yet so challenging. some levels seem impossible but the great thing is you can still advance as long as you have enough points. very well done. hats off to the designer. the physics are coded perfect as well for gravity friction inertia and sometimes extra bounce..  love it. can only handle it in bursts of play because it works your brain so intensely. havent used the hints either though. if you dont keep coming back to play this then you probably arent a very interesting person and spend too much time diddling your privates",
        "LOVE this game!! Literally, I don't think I can explain it. Just play it, and see for yourself :D    If you like figuring stuff & puzzles out, this is totally for you! And also, it's just so satisfying to watch. I personally play lots of the puzzles over & over again, just to see the graphics, how all the objects fly and move üòú",
        "I introduced this game to my 8 year old and my husband. We are all hooked! I am fascinated by the concept and simple yet brilliant design. The forced 30 second ads that another reviewer mentioned are only if you want a hint. The between-round ads are short and intermittent.",
        "Calling this a physics game is a joke. Sure, it has a physics engine that handles things like acceleration, \"mass\" and magnetism... But it's really just a very limited drawing game. Want to draw a ramp because it would lead to the most elegant solution? Sorry, can't... Because your \"pencil\" is too thick and the ball just hits the base of the ramp and bounces off. Know a simple solution? Well, have fun drawing it fifteen times while you get the exact dimensions needed in a very inexact system. I really think there are far better games to practice problem solving that don't get in your way as much as this one.",
        "A good sign of high intelligence would be to not pay for this.   On a tablet with a pen,  this probably works a little better but on a phone with 1 minute ads,   it's really frustrating.   Basically,  you find a solution and have to repeat it 30 times until the dull and unrealistic physics of this program finally accept it."

        "I like it, I use it to exercise and have fun with my sister. Only question I have is: How accurate is the kcal Burned counter? I played for over an hour and I am told I burnt 1,252 KCals. I question the accuracy of this. You update the game often, so can you put in the game somewhere the average calories the song the user is choosing to play burns? That is my biggest concern. Otherwise, no issues. Fun, easy to use. Great way to get exercise in all the while enjoying it with family and friends.",
        "Game is good as all just dance video games. Daughter enjoyed it until noticed that she had only a few dances then had to wait. There should be at least a shorter time to wait. Or some sort of option to earn more coins. Because 2 videos weren't enough. And one of them didn't work because the connection was lost. Again game was okay as for game play. But not sure its a keeper.",
        "It's fun to do and this game is perfect for me because I love to dance. Dancing is my favorite thing to go when I'm bored. I love the songs and dance moves it's awesome to play and do. Thx for making this game cause now I can do more dancing and dance moves. You guys should download this game for you new people cause it's awesome to learn but in a fun way. So if you suck and don't know how to dance then you should download this game it's perfect for you if you want to know how to do simple but hard dancing moves.",
        "Honestly, the game is great. It loads good, has amazing graphics and is easy to play. However the credits situation is absolutely retarded. I feel as if we shouldn't have to wait twenty-four hours to play ONE dance then wait again or pay $2.99 per DAY just to dance. You should at least have a page of good free dances for when someone has nothing to do!",
        "I really enjoyed playing this... Or at least the two songs I was able to play based on the coins that I had. My only criticism so far is that there should be ways to earn coins other than waiting so long for refills, watching ads, or buying coins. This strict control on earning coins doesn't make this a great game to play with a group of friends (though I know that you can buy VIP passes which are valid for a limited amount of time). It would add to the game play (as well as the overall experience of the game) if coins could be earned during the game in power ups or when you get perfect scores. This would give incentive to keep playing, let the games potentially last longer, and add to the competitiveness between players to enhance gaming fun.",
        "After actualization you can't make money you have to wait 24 hours until you can make money an you'll get 100 and the limit is 200 and there are no free songs. Before the actualization I had 350 coins when i turned it on I had only 250 and i can't even use the 50 because the songs cost 100!"

        "Great game, my only problem is that it took a long time grinding for the money you need to buy items. It took me about 5 hours of grinding just to upgrade each weapon/armor, 6 hours to buy new ones. Still a great game, loved the way it's in shadows, making it harder to tell who you are.",
        "Let me just say I don't mind a challenge. But the first boss fight is ridicoulous. You need to be lvl 7 to do anything. I would not have a problem with that but you have to farm survival mode to get lvl 7. No problem right well no there is a problem you get 2 xp for beating survival 2!!!!! And you need 400 this is freaking ridicoulous. Plus when you get lvl 7 he is like a regular oppenent. The difference between 1 lvl should not be this high",
        "Its a good game but consuming a lot of time because every next opponent is OP and i have to  buy  every new weapons after defeating  one opponent or craft it without which i will be crush down with 2,3 critical hits  and the coins are hard to find plus the energy should be unlimited. So that the game will be more fun",
        "The game crashes unexpectedly even in the middle of a fight and when I return the energy I used for the fight when it crashed is already consumed when I didn't even finish it.  It evwn crashes in the middle of a raid =(    The game is good but I hope the crashing is fixed. I restart my phone and it works smoothly after that but I can't have my phone restartung every time I want to play. Please fix this",
        "This game is requires you to spend cash if you wanna get strong or atleast equivalent to the game difficulty scaling. It requires spending more gold or gems rather than actual skills with over priced weapons and gears. The controls are not sensitive and clunky. Overall. Could have been a great game but greedy developers.",
        "Way to many adds. I've never had this problem until today but the ads are even popping up DURING a fight and COMPLETELY blocks the WHOLE screen. VERY annoying. Another major problem is you can't turn off the push notifications. ALSO, very annoying."

Really developer?, ya cant wait a tad longer to stop the game and make us stare at a cat puzzle? The worst. I didnt even play it long enough to appteciate the poor controlls. Shoulda known by the corny name that this was a bad game.",
        "Certainly has some potential if developed a bit more.Only played 1st 2 missions which were over in less than 30 secs considering Its only a small game. The AI is not good nor control system that great. Still be nice to see what looks like improvements after a few updateds. Keeping a lazy eye on this:-)",
        "I can see through the map in several places and the Enemy and the map itself is very Glitchy.   There is an Extremely annoying rooster crowing throughout the entire gameplay and yeah I could just mute it but why? I shouldn't have too!!   Then you can hear when an Enemy sneaks up behind you.  I had an alright time playing it but it's Definitely Not a game you'd wanna spend money on, at least not THIS Version anyway!!",

It's sad that even after so many feedbacks given for excessive advertisements still developers are running with it. I'm uninstalling this game n not recommending anyone to try it unless you want to watch commercials",
        "Overall....Great Game, but with Controls of Shooting & Moving around....It's Not Exactly Easy to Around. And when it comes to Movement just in General....my Main Problem, But NOT the Only Problem was the Movement in Exactness of where I'm Trying to Move my Guy (My/the Shooter) just Stinks!! - The Game itself....I Love It!!!",
        "Way way way to many ads. If you want to exit, you cant because an ad keeps popping up. After every mission or round an ad pops up. When you want to change a setting, an ad pops up. Could ne great, instead its the definition of a sellout"

        "The game is alright. Still too early to give it a proper review. Only here to say that the timers are way too long in the early stages of the game. Waiting an hour or four for thirty seconds of gameplay. They need to work on scaling the progression timers. A game like this is okay with long timers in late game when you have more than one thing to keep track of. But for these pay to win games to be profitable it helps to bait the hook a little harder before making you wait hours for more content.",
        "This game is a solid mix of \"clash of clans\" and \"fallout shelter\". Just like COC, you have to learn to let the timers cool off. The long term time investment can be very rewarding. The questing/pvp is also well done considering you can't choose what to attack or when during battle. Wholeheartedly a good game.",
        "Would be a great game if it wasn't blatantly pay to win.  Everything in the game is designed to push you to pay.  I enjoyed it at first and usually toss about $15 since it was decent.   But then, the system pairs you with opponents you can't defeat which then hampers your progress greatly which then means you either pay or hope you don't get attacked too much and lose all your resources.",
        "GG easy. everyone whining being pay to play this that. i never bought anything and I'm loving this, just need a little patience and you can do many things untill one thing gets done or upgraded. I'm high in ranks, have a clan dedicated to non buyers. its all cool. been over 4 months and i still play this its amazing! great work guys, keep it up and keep adding new stuff.",
        "The pay to win has gotten a little annoying for me especially the price they want. Fun game but you don't pay then you will not get as far as everyone else and will always be outmatched. Still having fun though just know I will never win PVP or tournaments or go to high in portals therefore ensuring I don't get good gear in either portal Store or tournament store.",
        "I love the game.  The thing is, this game just gets boring.  For example,  all you can do right now is to vanquish invasions. That's basically it. The portal is not always open.  The tournament? Well the match ups are way too oblivious.  My in game friends already have started quitting coz of these problems. You have to add something fun soon. Well it is still a fun game tho."

        "Easily my favourite android game. Hits all the right spots. While Blitz followed the runner style coins model and see how much you can travel, I am glad that in this game they ditched that over-used android model. I appreciate there vision, it's a complete different game from Blitz. Various fictional cars and characters that seem original inspirations and charming in their own way. The tracks have a theme. Boss races under every championship. There is so much of soul in the game. And you can adjust resolution, add colour correction, adjust many other effects. Words don't do justice here nor does 5/5.",
        "Amazing! I play this game daily and I never got bored. Just one thing: other drivers don't use special abilities which does not makes it challenging. Now since I have completed this game once, I would expect devs to add new levels and characters. I have an idea for a new character. Please contact me if I can help you",
        "The controls take some getting used to. But for a Mario-Kart-like experience for mobile, this game gets my #1 rating. Feels more like Diddy Kong racing to be honest though. Can be played when you only have enough a few minutes, or grinded for awhile until you run out of tickets.",
        "Second Beach Buggy game, this one you race opponents with some fun, but dirty tricks. A lot of reviews are unfair, just need to figure out strategies. Needs a few new tracks to update it a bit! I cleared it out 4 times & started over, love it! Played everyday for over a year, great fun. Needs a sequel, hope they didn't give up, there is no updates on their site. BBR-2, yea baby!",
        "The game just restarted as if I never played it. Just went through the tutorial as a new player. I have been playing for months. Not sure what happened! Can't sync it with google games. I do know I was playing and mid game my phone battery died. I recharged it and went to the game and went default on me.",
        "I understand apps need to make $ but this game is just money hungry. They use all of the tactics in the book to get you to spend but that is not what upsets me. What upsets me is that on the top of that they force you to watch ads alot and they do not reward you in game for doing so."

        "Ok, so I will be calm in this review. Whenever I have the same car in a battle with red, we ram each other, but they push me off the map with ease. The main reason why I wrote a review for this game is that you should make the alien levels a little easier. The last level for it is way too hard, you can barely aim at the boss. The controls are hard too. Also can you optimize the game for the Samsung Galaxy tab A?",
        "I would have given this game a higher review than three that I have given it, the problem is that I have noticed a problem when trying to save some money. For me at least when trying to save money through the daily giveaway/present of playing the game everyday it has stolen money from me discreetly whenever I get around the 1000 coin mark sometimes it is one hundred sometimes I have lost 400 with no explanation as to where the money is. It is for this reason that I have lowered my rating. (Besides the disappearing money I enjoyed the game.)",
        "This game is pretty good, for the most part. The only problem is the bots you go upagainst are  way to hard. I can never win. I would have gave them 5 stars but I gave them 4 stars because of the bots. And the game is kinda hard to control. When I move backwords on a veichel it goes up.",
        "Good for killing time. Some of the computer driven opponents seem to have a very decisive advantage at initial start of certain stages, and some of the smaller vehicles are too sensitive on the controls  but overall decent game.",
        "This game needs major fixes, on mission mode, I get my reward after completing a level but I can't ever go anywhere after it. So I never get to move on the next level. üòí",
        "Great game, would just love if replays were available to more phones, mine isn't able to do replays yet. Just wondering if it might be coming soon. I've got a Pixel 2."

        "Cute game, but not without it's flaws. I forgot the reasons I deleted the game in the past, but remember them now. It drains your battery, the life refresh time is high (20 minutes) and starting at a certain level (30) you really can't progress WITHOUT friends (this is not a positive for everyone. I personally don't like it), or money, or a ton of patience. You need keys to progress. You can either buy, ask friends, or play for one every FOUR HOURS. This is the exact point where I uninstalled the game last time.",
        "I would taste this game higher if the only way you could progress wasn't by having to purchase extras. Having to waste all my extras to get through a gate with 3 keys sucks and so does knowing that really the only way through is to buy your way through.",
        "I'm uninstalling game! I was really happy with game when I started,  now there is an ad every next life and sometimes more! Same ad over and over, enough to drive you CRAZY! Also you can't answer quick text or do anything off screen without the game totally rebooting,  it's supposed to be relaxing to play on phone,  NOT IRRITATING!",
        "Why bother having an X on the Level Rush notification if it doesn't work so you have to press Begin and wait for the animation to finish before you can carry on with claiming the Daily Challenge. Also 'play with friends' on the tournament never does anything. Otherwise fun.",
        "I have to uninstall. I love it, but it gets to the point that you cannot win.  So disappointed!!!!! I will say, this game has the very best customer service of any game I have ever played. Every single time, they go above and beyond. It's so sad when it becomes so frustrating that you can't keep playing a game that you love. I've spent b money trying to keep it fun, but I can't do b it anymore :(",
        "I have enjoyed this game immensely up until level 240. In this level, rated HARD, there are most often no options to make strings and you're stuck with only strings of 3 of just plain air. When you see the game itself changing the color of treats several times during one game to give you a move, you know you're not imagining that this level is designed to screw you over into making fruitless purchases to overcome it."

I like this game because you can do roleplay and I'm a girl and there is girl skins which is amazing but can you start with a girl skin and a boy skin to be fair with the girls  Pls do these. Love your company :-) but can you add a roleplay mode that would be great DO MORE:-) but now on my new tablet it won't let me play it please fix that and reply",
        "Good. However, the apple versioned platform overwhelms us by many advantages: They can earn coins and cash quicker n easier. They get options on what currency they use to purchase things. They get to higher leagues easier. Their weapon description overpasses ours as ours literally gives us damage and capacity whereas theirs comes with fire rate, trait etc.",
        "I love this game but I have a couple of requests 1st. Could you add u YouTuber skin back like boy,girl,animal then YouTuber 2nd. Could you add a button that you can press that alows you to make your own custom paint job for any vehicle that would be amazing 3rd. Can you make and road that ends come back into the city at the other side example the road behind the hospital 4th. Could add like 5 houses around the city that you can go into 5th. More vehicles   If you agree with what I have sead in this comment like so the developer can see!",
        "I love this game. But for the next update, u should give each skin there own special ability. Like the flash and hulk skins. Give the flash super speed, give hulk super strength and etc. So that everyone can get a different type of advantage. Plz make this happen next update also make a goku skin. So u can turn super saiyan. And have other transformation. So can u plz have every skin to have different abilities that match the skin",
        "I have been playing the game for 6 or 5 years and it has been the best game i have played. So, i  think you have to make this game better in the next update.Here r my suggestions 1 make the graphics better. 2 day and night shift. 3police attacks bandit in adventure mode.4 add a clan.  I hope u will add these in the next update.Also too many players that hacked their health so plz fix it.Thx",

I have a Samsung galaxy 8+,  unlimited data, and 4glte at all times and have 2 apps that are very internet run and they work fine, but rats has some issues. I've noticed others to comment about it and they just recently had a maintenance day, but sadly doesn't seem they fixed it.",

        "So I LOVE THIS GAME. I beat it once and had to uninstall it due to space issues. I couldn't find it until now. It is a very nice game controls graphics everything on point. Overall my review is 4 stars. ONLY because it needs more levels as the difficulties aren't extra levels but just harder  versions of those so maybe more levels and islands if possible and more stick warriors and it can even go into the skies or galaxy or so although I don't know if that sounds like too much but more levels. If it had multiplayer (online as optional) also, so u can play offline but if u want multiplayer u get online. I'm not trying to be picky. Such an awesome game finished too quickly.",
        "Great game. Seriously like my fav app. One minor glitch they needed to patch though is that, at least for me, it's not giving me the achievements for the zombie mode. Like I've survived 24 nights but I don't even have the achievements for\"survive 5 nights\". I should have all the achievements unlocked but I don't because some of the zombie achievements I'm not receiving for some reason. But besides that minor annoyance, it really is a sweet app.i used to play the classic version back in the day and I was so happy when I found out they made it into an app. Right now my goal is to win the tournament mode on insaine 100 times, I'm currently at 59. GG!",
        "Its a good game up until you play on anything other than normal. The upper difficulties make it impossible to progress past spartans unless you buy gems and get power ups, smh",
        "This is one of the most awesome game of all time and thanks to the creators you can play it on mobile too. But it still lack some awesome components, 1. Add Chaos Empire, 2. Add multiplayer!!! Overall still AWESOME!!!",
        "You know,  its a shame because this is a fantastic game. There is ZERO balancing. The entire game is designed to force you into using gems and micro transactions to get past abnormally difficult gameplay walls.",
        "I wish there were more commands. Like maybe you could command the miners to garrison while the rest of the troops guard. Also, redesign the swordwrath helmet. It looks like someone spray painted their hair gold and then glued jewels on it. I also wish there could be more types of zombies. The idea of endless is cool but please add the zombies to the campaign."

For we were working on one for a long time and after one of thise repetitive ads, the app shut down.....",
        "I actually had this game a long time ago but have not rate this yet. At first all the colours were not unlocked yet so i was pretty disappointed. After a while everthing was unlocked so i was super excited. It doesn't get me board everytime i have different desins to do.",
        "Its the BEST game I EVER played! Also, when I was 4, we didnt unlock anything. Now I am 17 and we have every thing for free! I love glitchs. Dont try to fix them though!  I love them and u sould 2. Peace out!",
        "I  am finally at the final last level! Before I thought it was boring but after I reached some levels farther I thought it was awesome! And it is the best game ever!

I got everything for free!! HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA",
        "Buyer beware, I purchased the \"unlock all manicures\" option less than a year ago, not only to unlock options but also to remove Ads for my kids. It's less than a year later, and ads are back, with an option to remove them for another fee. When paying just about 8 bucks less than a year ago, I find this distasteful. At least give a full year of ad free gameplay. Not impressed.",
        "Thank goodness all the purchase went it was so lame to play it before when you barely had enough colours and stickers. But now it's all perfect and also one of my favourite games"

You have to walk on top of the items to grab em. Make the pet useful and have it pick up items.   Abysmal inventory management. No auto arrange. Selling items is per page instead of selling low tier items first.  Great graphics doesn't save it from being uninstalled.",

        "Love the game, BUT there's a glitch in chest bow where it locks up for 1 shot, multiple times a day. After you shoot without being able to aim, the bow works normal until the next jam. Looked for a place to submit info for possible fix, BUT game doesn't provide a place for feedback. This is only place to air complaints :(",

        "I play this game regularly, and I enjoy the differing modes available. You can play happily without paying for any additional content, however at higher levels paying will help you progress. By this time you will have poured hours into it, so I do not think it is unreasonable. Save your gold until later levels (player level 15+) and you can get by without in game purchases for quite a while.",
        "I absolutely love this game. Turn based tactics are one of my favourite types of games. Since playing the game more I've decided that there's not enough gas for me to be able to enjoy the game like I want to. I think the car should either hold more, or gas should be easier to get. This is just a game that already has inconsistencies with reality. Otherwise I love the game",
        "Just loved it... I am at council level 18 now... Weapon upgrade xp cost should be reduced or just remove workshop. No use of WORKSHOP with such high xp cost because its REASONABLE to upgrade your SURVIVOR than their WEAPONS.... Please for next update reduce weapon upgrade cost....",
        "I've been playing this game for two years now and I can never put it down. It's such an amazing game. I'd like it even more though if the characters we originally fell in love with were available. Like Andrea, T-Dog, Lori, etc.",
        "I like this game, but the reason I'm giving it a 2 star rating because the game can't load. After the first time I played it, when I went to play it again it froze. I've been waiting at the game to load for like 5 minutes and decided that the game was broken. Can I get help, I might change my rating.",
        "Great time waster. Wish the gas would increase quicker. Hero's are pretty easy to get after a while. Freemium aspects of the game not shoved down your throat they are there but not essential (So far) LVL 25"

I can't even play Verses mode!!!!! Every time i win it lose, it cuts off! I can't even get credit for wins or losses!

Barely won a hand since the negative review also. Complete B.S game. I agree with all negative reviews here. 4.5 rating? Haha, most reviews are negative.  Done and done.",
        "Worst poker app there is. As soon as you make money it makes you lose no matter your hand. Probably bots. Only bad whole cards win. Play if you want but DO NOT SPEND A CENT ON THIS APP. It's fixed. Che k out you tube for proof. Then the send garbage email to say it's not fixed. Sent to every bad review. Please play a different app anyone.",

        "The controls are in need of work, big time!! The current setup is too unresponsive, too frequently. This was the case even when I had the game on my Galaxy S7 (it's now on my Galaxy J3 Emerge). Switch to a more conventional d-pad & action button config, already!! Otherwise, the game is pretty sweet!! Looks innocent & simple, but it's actually quite challenging. Better controls would help a lot, though!!",
        "You should expand the game by making the existing map bigger, and by adding more maps. Also it would be cool if you added a drop to clear your traps, as there's a drop for everything else. It's a really fun, and addicting game, kind of reminds me of COD Zombies. I think it lacks a little advancement. I hope this game doesn't get lost in the mix like every other game with potential. It gets a little repetitive so by adding some stuff I would give it 5 stars and pay for this game.",
        "This is a great game! It is very fun! The only two things that I did not like were these, No.1  You can not drive the ghost busters car! No.2 The ghost busters song is not playing well you play the game! Other then that it is a great game! I would defiantly upload this game! It is very fun!!! Ghost buster out üòâüí©",
        "This is better for parents who want their kids to experiance the franchise. The game is VERY repetitive. The charicters hold the wand horribly, no origional voice acting or sounds, and below average graphics. Hardcore Ghostbusters fans better pass on this one.",
        "A very basic game where you run around the firehouse catching ghosts with short range blasts from your proton pack.  The ghosts just keep coming, so the challenge is to last as long as you can.    Controls are simple: left side of the screen moves left, right side moves right, and there are two buttons to shoot.  When you fill up your traps, empty them in the containment unit on each floor.  Visual cues remind you what to do.  After collecting enough ghosts, you can upgrade your character.  Fill up all three containment units for a short duration super beam mode.  Upgrades and custom characters don't carry over to future plays. Mainly a cute time waster for little kids that are into the Ghostbusters.",
        "Couldn't even use original voices with audio from the movie? Also bad controls. I usually play mobile games with a bluetooth controller. Make this game better!"

        "A very reliable app. I would be better if it showed the bullets the gun fires, I don't think a desert eagle shoots rifle bullets (btw I love the Russian rullet feature)",
        "Nice gun simulation, but needs a lot more of special improvements and weapons, which are these: 1.Add a sledgehammer, a Katana and  other melee weapons, needs more firearms as well, example:Nail gun, 50 Cal (machine gun and sniper type), compound bow, grenade launcher, M249 and MO and others. 2.Due to people that wanted to record the gun sounds, you should add a option that enables and disables the bullet shell and able to edit the bullet shell volume. 3. This one is important, the gun sound should be smoother and the sound should be a lot more better because some of them sound a bit too soth and pathetic. 4. This is also important, when every gun ran out of ammo it makes a weird sound effect , you need to disable it because it sounds not so realistic and completely annoying when I tried to record the sound. 5. This is the last one, this is very simple only, 'cause most of your guns are created out of pixels, do that by changing the model.   Alright that's all of them I hope you add them.",
        "Great game! Except for the constant redirects to websites performing \"virus checks\" and terrible reloading.",
        "Amazing I always find a way to play with it somehow. It is really fun and I really really love this app! Please add some new guns life British weapons or something. That will always be cool too! :)",
        "Its the best gun app. I mean if you have no gun sense, this will show you the names of certain guns. Know what im sayin???"

        "Honestly, I like this one the most. I like that it keeps the mini games present, but it has a new game style as well. I also love that you can play as the characters, as well as the fact that they now have a backstory! The game itself isnt too difficult, making it a nice game to play at all times. The only thing i dont like is the amount of ads, but it is a new game, and ot needs its funding to stay up and running. Overall, good job Metro! Keep it up! :D",
        "Nice game. I like the concept of rebuilding but this game was meant to kill time, I hope so. Keep adding characters and what we require is a hell lot of mini games so that they may keep coming and coming and coming. I do not intend to harass you but try to add more and more mini games after each update. I'm sure that in the course of  time you may be able to compete with the best games ever created but do not make the game larger than DWTD 2. Add more new locations too otherwise we will not be able to consume the tokens. The game is nice because you do not have to consume money for characters and get them through gifts instead. It is also nice because tokens can be collected easily. Please think about my opinions. I‚ù§ this game.",
        "Brilliant! It is absolutely fantastic! Bit of lag and ads but apart from that it's perfect. Also it's very different from the other dumb ways to day which goes to show how much effort the creator(s) put into making them.They didn't just quickly make a few quick games for the money. No. They put effort. It is amazing. The deaths are funny and the characters are cute and so is the art style. Creator, GREAT JOB!!!",
        "The character models are cute and all, but the games are getting a bit repetitive. WAY too many ads. Like, ridiculously too many. The app forces a couple right after you finish some of the minigames. You have enough to offer us - forcing even more ads on top of that is tiresome. Get rid of them.",
        "Dumb ways to die 3 gets 3 stars. No, seriously, I loved the first 2, but this one is not good. Only 4 minigames, not really different each from another. Remember FASTER FASTER FASTER ? It disappeared (I miss it), and is now ADS ADS ADS. The goal here is just to use money and play as often as you can for ADS ADS ADS. The main thing here ? Minigames ? Nooooo, just getting (or buying) tokens and use them to repair houses (no impact on gameplay). Why would this game be nice ? The graphics are still good. Yes, that's all. Have a nice day. ADS ADS ADS",
        "I loved the other two games and this one is no exception.I've just been wondering what's meant to happen after you press pledge on the little red thing?also there should be more minigames.Is there an update coming soon with a new location?(I've completed all of them)"

        "Um, Its a cute game. It is an.okay game to play. But certain thing can be change. When its festival time you can only play one task at a time. I think that stupid because sometimes you don't have all the ingredients or spices for a task you have chosen, but you ended up having other ingredients for another task. But the only way , you can choose that other task if you quit your current one in which you have work hard and also you loose 50 diamond's for that. Not fair because diamonds are not easy to find. There a lot more i dislike about it. I only play because its a distraction sometimes. A lot of people has left playing the game and i can see why Because at times,  it can be very boring. But there's a lot of things i think can be improved.",

I didn't mind spending a little bit of real money on It, but it has started to become a rather expensive game. Why on earth would you change the festival gameplay.  I am finding this game has actually become stressful and expensive rather than fun and relaxing",
        "When u feel like playing a relaxing game that's not so intense this game is perfect. There are waiters doing it for u and all u have to do is install coffee machines and talk to your customers. Personally to some people this game might be boring but I really love it",
        "I think this is a great game in general, good graphics and gameplay. However I always have difficulties trying to purchase the gifts, like it will take very long to process the transaction. Is the developer able to do anything about it? It will be greatly appreciated.",
        "I would give this game five stars, but I was on level 8, going at a good pace, and the game restarted, taking me back to the start of level 7! Completely frustrated with this. Made all that time I spent on getting to the next level worthless."

        "I love this game great graphics. You can't connect with other user offline. I wish you could make skirmish an offline version. I also wish that if you could add an restart option during the mission. Mostly because when you miss an subjective you have to wait for the mission to end and select the card afterward than it gives you the option to redue the mission. Other than that great game keep up the good work",
        "I think the shooting range should be mechinary the bullet shouldn't be reloaded . It should be going as many as it can. Nice game. Really I don't play games but for cover fire am in love with it. And please there should be no end of it because am playing it. Till I lost my phone. üòÇ",
        "The story is simple and clear so that make it enjoyable game. The action not less fun at lease that make me thrilled when i play it. Nothing special bout the control, but there is one thing that not much game in this genre had... It is offline mode. But still there is some part that you guys can be a bit loosen up like let all this game players have free vip fiture. That definitely will give more excitement the the play. So may please considered this suggestion here... There still lot more part to be improve by you all guys. Thx",
        "All good and I've completed all ur levels in 10days. Now I'm awaiting for ur new levels and one more which I'm surprised is that.. I'm expecting some stories to end it. I've understood so far that there are other side people who are building some thing and they r trying to stop us but I have not understood why these 2 group are fighting and who is the leader in my group and theirs too. U need to make some more realistic stories so that we can take it part of action movie.. Thanks otherwise",
        "I am rewriting my review and giving 5 stars for all. One of the rare games where it is possible to play without paying real money. If you want you can pay to proceed faster but not paying doesn't mean that the game will be unplayable. Bravo!",
        "Great graphics, good storyline, campaign mode is challenging. It would be better if more scenarios could be added for skirmishes. Overall enjoyed it. I will recommend even for those who don't wish to spend money on games."

The game is incredibly fast paced so you can play up to about 4 games in 10 minutes. It's never boring and always keeps you on your toes. Both sides are fun. (I feel the sniper needs a buff but this is just my opinion). Other than that small compliant  I love this game.",
        "It was very fun testing the early access! And the thing that i noticed was the new token system. Im not saying the token system was bad, but i liked the older system better. On how there were bronze, silver, and gold stars, and the star depended how good the item was. I was wondering why you changed it. –±–ª–∞–≥–æ–¥–∞—Ä—è!",
        "This game has been amazing since early-access. I  have loved it for a long time and will still love it for a long time. One suggestion though. It would be cool if one could emote inside the van once you have got away or have been arrested",
        "Excellent game. Highly replayable. Fun and challenging. My only issue is that emotes switch from one side to the other when playing as a thief vs playing as a sniper. Plus, having to hit a button to fire vs just hitting the right side of the screen is a bit more difficult. Otherwise, almost perfect game.",
        "WARNING: YOU WILL BE HOOKED AS SOON AS YOU START THE GAME. The game is really cool, I love the gadgets, the replayability, variety of maps, and how this could be free to play. Even though there are alot of glitches, these improvements will make up for them",
        "Its greedy from the developer to make bigger price of silver and other chests every time when i get close enough to amout of gold needed for buying it. First the price of silver chest was 80 then when i got 60gold price gone to 110 then when i had 90 gold it got up to 130 its like they are pushing me to spend money and i never did that. Good game but so greedy that it deservs one star!!!!"

        "I really love this game. Of course it WANTS you to spend real money on it, but you don't really have to to make progress. Just set stuff up then go back to it later. As per other reviews it does take a while to load, but due to the excellent graphics, music and overall feeling of happiness I get playing this - they are forgiven.",
        "SO HAPPY!üòÄüòÄüòÄüòÄüòÄüòÄ This is really fun! It is really magical. I love disney ever since I saw this game. Just it lags when we collect rewards and it kicks me off. Rather than that it is perfect! Great game, I need more games like this! Why do companies  do not make more games like this ?! I had been playing since the second month it came out! So 2 years. Who cares about money I do not use my real money and I am progressing a lot! Maybe it is some phones and tablets. When I do not need the characters I put them in long missions and get a bunch of magic. SO HAPPY!",
        "Okay, this is probably the most honest review I will ever take the time to write. The game is beautiful and entertaining...just like everything Disney does. The other thing Disney does EXTREMELY well is suck money from you (I live in Orlando - I KNOW this, Man). I'm not proud of what I'm about to say but I just spent $30 on essentially a \"Russian Roulette\" for Alice in Wonderland characters. It's like this...the game is entertaining and enjoyable to an extent...but if you're money concisious don't download this game. I've played a lot of app games and this one FAR surpasses the need for real money. The game is entertaining and fun if you semi/kinda love Disney stuff because of nostalgia or whatever...but if you're a die-hard Disney fanatic...this game will bankrupt you. So, fear it.",
        "I really love this game. My only complaint is when they have special release items every 2 hours or every 4 hours. They release 24 hours a day, so if you want to rank high on the leaderboard you have to wake up multiple times a night to play! I'm sleep deprived!",
        "OK I love this game, however have a problem, I recently broke my phone had to send it of to get fixed. Have uploaded this game to my iPad have clicked it over to the correct game to keep my level however gets right to the loading section then kicks me out. My iPad is up to date, can you please fix this bug. I haven't played for a few games, the tempary phone I have won't let me play either. Please fix..",
        "This is a literal waiting game.   Little to no reward for waiting hours at the very start.   I tried being patient and sticking to it but the waiting just gets longer.   It's a money sink.   You'll not make any progress.   The chests are a joke, the rewards are a joke, and you'll never unlock new characters."

        "I have only had the game a few hours and I am already falling in love with it. It is great to go on when you have a spare 10-15 minutes. The grid is larger than others so I can read the words fluently and quickly without them being hard to see. You get points after each time you complete the grid so if you are really stuck you can receive a hint for some points. I would highly recommend this excellent game.",
        "Only been playing for a few days now, and so far, I love it! Forgot how fun Word Search puzzles can be, and to have it on my phone is priceless lol.. No complaints with the app so far. I will say though, maybe they should tweak it just a tad, instead of giving a hint only after a short moment, possibly creating 'the option' to have a hint may be a little better. Not a big deal to me. It truly is a great app, love the simplicity of the graphic design too. Glad I came across this game.",
        "I enjoy ALMOST the whole game, being a word find and all, simple, yet deceptively hard at times. Still, I wish there was a way to turn off the 'hints' it gives, as they get annoying... unless there IS a way that I haven't discovered yet...otherwise, I REALLY like the game, and would suggest it to all ages, as it's not too tough for the young ones, but still challenging enough for experienced players.",
        "Pretty good word search game. It's sometimes hard to hit the right letters, especially toward the bottom of the screen. Occasionally words share more than one letter in common. Sometimes  (especially in the  lower levels) a word will show up more than  once in a puzzle. Maybe extra credit for finding a word that's not on the list?",
        "It's a good game but there needs to be a way to turn off hints. If you don't find a word in the time it thinks you should, it keeps giving hints which ruins the gameplay. I pause for various reasons like talking to someone, cat catching a mouse, watching tv at the time, etc.. Or sometimes it might take longer to fins a word than seconds allowed before the hint.",
        "I love this game. Really nice and well thought out game. It's educative too. But I have just one issue with it though: The flashing hint. This gets me distracted each time it flashes. Maybe there could be a hint button at the bottom of the puzzle. That way instead of it flashing and getting us distracted, we could just click on it whenever we need help. Apart from that, it's just perfect. Will give it a 5 when the flashing hint is worked onüòÅ"

        "Absolutely nothing to do after completing campaign mode because all the events after RQ100 are pvp based and with a RQ150 limit while you are only around RQ110 - 115 when you complete campaign.  Even if you paid a lot of real cash to roll for good S class cars it does not mean you could go further after the relatively short campaign mode.  The game is so dead after you 100% the campaign and there will hardly be any reward for you to make way to RQ125 + in order to be competitive in those pvp events again.  This game probably just last 2 weeks tbh.  Great hope and great let down.",
        "Definitely a game for car buffs. It requires using your \"mind\" to win. I'm not to sure about my rating yet. But, will definitely change if needed. It's unlike any game I've played & I like it! Someone wrote a review that this is a lazy person's game... LMA√ò, I wish they would show me the games they play while they are running, swimming & mountain climbing \"while\" they play, smh HAHA!",
        "First download crashed and wouldn't load. Had to reinstall the game and Hutch games couldn't recover my profile so had to start again from scratch. I've played through several updates and fixes but the same issues remain, car X beats car y when it shouldnt. Hutch in game support agree there is a problem and send to devs but nothing gets fixed. The whole game seems flawed. To be competitive to you will have to spend about ¬£50 a month. I enjoy the premise but the game is poorly executed.",
        "I love the concept and it's been great to see how far this game has come, but I've been playing since beta and nearly every update wipes my save data and forces me to restart. Luckily, I don't get too far into the game each time, but it is frustrating and enough of a buzz kill for me to drop two stars. If there was a cloud system implemented for saves this game would be a five star in my book",
        "Incredible game. Awesome concept. Two complaints to developers. High speed loop-when you win, it starts detracting points. And also certain mph based drag races,I run out of road but the challenging car gets like 60 miles of road. Besides these, fantastic game.",
        "Followed your advice exactly same as before it doesn't reset to my previous stats back at the start of the game. It's been 2 weeks now and still nothing so I will no longer be playing which is a shame because it was a good game"

For a simple game like this these facts fore me to give only one star. Fix the code and improve the graphics and it can easily get a 4 to 5 star rating.",
        "Silly pointless battery killing little game, I loved it! The game kinda runs out of puff after level 150 though, as there is nothing else to achieve. I've got all the prestige balls, all the regular balls, all above level 150. Can we have some higher order balls above Thunder please?",
        "Looks BORING at first. But I can't put it down now. And to those complaining about the adds, spam the back button after they start. The only adds this doesn't work for are the ones with the fast forward button in the top left",
        "AD INFESTED! Opens up adds (videos) every time you level up pretty much, which is every 5-15 seconds in the beginning. I cannot give this a proper review when half the game is just watching ads.",
        "Would give this a better review, but there are so many glitches. You can only upgrade a booster once, then you have to close the app and open it again so you can keep upgrading. Loved the game before this started happening. And the tap boost should be longer than 60 seconds, how about 30 minutes like the speed boost.",
        "The first thing that happens when you open the game is collect what you've earned while you're away. And whether or not I pick the X2 option I have to wait through a 30 second add. Every. Time. Whoever decided to force adds at every collection is costing the developer a lot of money."

BUT THOSE FREAKING AAAADDDSSS ARE FRACKING ANNOYING.  sometimes i dislike playing...most of the time when you leave the live area the freaking ads kicks in and sometimes its 30 seconds  long and by that time i already lost my finger coordination and i just exit out of the game.  Why can't we purchase the game so the ADS will be gone.  Just like any other apps.",

You need to sort a league out also need to sets and legs against players and also the scoring when it looks like it's in a treble it's given as a single there are not fall outs or hitting wires which make things more interesting",

My only qualm with this game is that everytime you level up a full screen ad gets in the way. Usually they can be closed out easily but not always. Regardless, it's the best free brain training app I have used and it really keeps you sharp!üòÄ",
        "Its rlly a good game for brain training!! Idk why but i didnt find any bug, glitch, or smthing like they all saying. It works well in my device. This is the best app for training your brain. Ofc its not easy, its so challenging, in a good way. I rlly struggle in quick searching and some stages, but its just so addicting and so great!! I recommend you to download it!!!",
        "Additive and helpful. Its not an over night cure so people expecting that need help instead lol. It doesn't deserve a low rating. Yes theres add but it's to be expected with a free game. Having adult a.d.d and huge memory issues.. i can i liked this game. 100 doors is anther good one.",
        "It's fun. My problem is on the attention one we are suppose to click stop once the red dot is on the brain and I do. There is plenty of time to click it  but it tells me i missed it. No matter how many times I click it while the red dot is still on the brain. If I press it 10 times then the screen that tells me I've failed comes up 10 times. Driving me insane.",
        "There's a glitch in \"Quick Decision Skill\" game. It is based on whether the previous and current object is same or not. When I click on the peach-moon-type object as same, it gives error, though I click on Same when two moons appear consecutively in the game. This way I'll not be able to clear the levels.",
        "I love it!!! The games are interesting. Now I am on \"memory match\" game which was initially locked and it keeps on freezing and promotes me to next level without me completing the level well. Besides that, I would highly recommended it to others, it's worth installing."

No, need to join the T Club (who comes up with this) and pay an ongoing fee. It's TETRIS from the 80s, EA must you milk everything. Nothing is sacred",
        "Classic tetris with modern graphics, you can use one touch controls or classic directional pad if you wish, both have their own advantage. I am afraid I can't find Bradinsky song. It's okay for me with advisement because EA need something to eat right? Lol",
        "Enjoyed it at first, and short adverts were expected, but recently adverts have become longer, and now last longer than the game. The latest video advert lasted inbetween games lasted 8 mins....ridiculous!!!. I understand the need for adverts, but if you can't play the game, the adverts are pointless, espeacially if it makes players quit.",
        "Great game, but there's an annoying window that pops up everytime I try and start a new marathon. The window is pretty much useless and wastes my time. Would give this 5 stars if it gets patched",
        "Great game and builds on. The original. The only thing stopping it getting the 5* rating is that the ads on it are sometimes several minutes long and at times when they have finished you can't return to the game. I don't mind watching them as I know that's what funds it, but they are putting me off playing now.",
        "Trying to play Tetris with these abysmal touch and swipe controls is an absolute abject mess. Just add some virtual buttons in, since your loot-boxing asses are supposedly so focussed on 'player choice' lately."

Me, however, grinded to get 800 gold for a UMP after a month or so, then I had deleted the game because I couldn't find a game where I had a fair battle with someone in-game. However this game is still nice.",

Good game four a you get crowd I think I because it's not really a strategy cooking game where you have to time manage and things. It had a decorating feature that I think kids would enjoy. Also, with that feature, a tablet would be better. Or if on a mobile, a stylis.",
        "Good game but too many things locked and that makes it 3 star from 5 star. Please coco tab tale unlock the whole game. In competitions always I am third because things are locked. You know money is very precious can't spend on a game. Please please please please unlock things. Ok bakeries we will do but others you. And yes when I have not reached that bakery then the orders come in which they can be completed in other bakery only?üòüüòû",
        "Nice game... everyone who love cooking should download it. But there is only one problem that the things which are the main are locked and we have to pay the real money or watch s 40 ad. For ex:- In the doll cake we don't have the doll so how are we going to bake it.Please fix this problem, otherwise the game is nice.",
        "At first, I was pleasantly suprised this came from TabTales. The lack of pay walls at the beginning is wonderful for their games. Though I'm not very creative, the game demands it for making food. The graphics look great, gameplay is realistic. I was sad to see a paywal at the princess cake though. If you have 10 dollars and a young girl who loves to cook and bake, by all means buy it for her.",
        "This game is awesome!!!! It makes me go hungry every time I play it!!! The graphics are awesome and very realistic. I luv the fact that it is automatic so you don't have to waste your time in perfection... Please keep it automatic like this forever. P.S, for those who are worried about unlocking other stuff like the princess cake, etc. Well, don't be, you will get a chance to play it when you unlock the other new bakeries and when you also compete in the competitions.... üòâ",
        "Most of the things r automatic so I rate it 3 or 4 stars. Pls guys pls,pls I want u to make it nonautomatic so that we can play it properly .that's all I want to say about this game and most and things are locked these r the two things which I did not like about this game. So guys pls make it properly. Then I will rate it 5 stars for sure. One of the best game I have ever played. Thank u so much"

The actual game itself is amazing despite having a hard time trying to beat the bacteria level but, what's the point of a good game concept, if the game won't work properly",
        "I thought the new scenario was a free-trial only like the simian flu. (At least you can unlock it after being a brutal pro at the game) I'm gonna enjoy playing this a good few times and unlock even MORE scenarios. Keep up the good work! I wanted to make a suggestion, but I just can't remember now. Oh well...",
        "The game is addictive but when you get to a certain point the cure kicks in and it stops giving away DNA points and it makes it hard to advance in the game. I have read the hints in the news it gives, but I still can't manage to beat the game. I want to delete the game. Butim going to continue to try. I just wanted to mention it idk if its the game or just me. I won't tell others about the game only because its frustrating to play. These games are not good for people to play that has any type of mental issue unless they want to buy a new phone.",
        "Fun game. I wish the rate of death was more consistent. 37,000,000 a day at one point, but waiting 6 months for 100,000 to die towards the end. The disease didn't change, the rate of death shouldn't decrease just because there are fewer people. Good game otherwise",
        "From beginning to end I've been pleasantly surprised and let down but mainly let down. I was all for this game when it came out but now you wanna make a quick buck on a scenario app... pay more for something that should be part of the game. Overall good game business practices not so much.",
        "I didn't buy the new plague, i might need to. The first 2 difficulty settings are easy, the 3rd not so much. Good game to me! Just have to read what it is that you spend your DNA points on and you should do just fine"

        "Lost another These constant updates caused me to uninstall this. Fun game - very good game!But if it ain't broke don't fix it. I will not sacrifice all the other good games I have for this single one. Now with google only allowing so many apps ( no writing to sd card). Atleast if you update you should let people keep playing with version they have. Make updates optional.",
        "It's a fun game. If you're a COD player you'll love it. In general It does good on it's own as a solid shooter. Only thing I think you really, REALLY need to change is the way to get weapons. Using rentals is great, picking up enemy or ally weapons, sure, but having to spend money to get most weapons, if not all, seems a little unfair. It's good that there's a grind to get them but I think it's a little overkill how difficult it is. I think levels should determine what you unlock, then use silver (make it easier to get) to purchase it. Or, if players want to speed up the process, use gold.",
        "I really like the game. Fun, exciting, and addictive. The only problem I have is that the rewards you get are not nearly enough as I think they should be. Exp gains are good, but cash gains are so bad and you will have to play for hours to accumulate cash and then you can buy HALF of a weapon, because they require a lot of cash to get one. You also can barely upgrade weapons without any gold and you can just forget about that unless you put some real world currency in this game, which is a real shame. As a player I know we would like to buy and upgrade our own weapons instead of having to \"rent\" which is an option in the game.",
        "Do not install this game! It is broken! For start the spawning doesnt work. You can spawn behind people, in front of people and inside of people who are your enemies. Second is the complete unbalance between premium and standard weapons. You can hit someone with a standard shotgun at close range three times and not kill them. They will then one shot you wherever they hit with a sniper. Dont waste your time people!",
        "One of the dumbest cod ripoff i have seen and played in 2k18 so far. You need 20 bullets to kill someone with head shot. Dont waste your time with this dumb game. Play something else and yea a FREAKING TANK IN A MAP THIS SMALL. like were you under the influence of some substances when you made this game. Wast of time. Dont download this abomination.",
        "Good game. Needs a seeding system. Getting bored of being killed by players 10-15 levels above me. Spawn points need looking at too. Keeps respawning at the same point I just died at. There appears to be some hacked players too. Just shot 1 guy 7 times in the head and he took it and shot me back once which was enough to kill me"

        "It is so amazing i love this game and have had 3 accouts before on it. on my ipad but now i have it on my laptop. I have allways loved it and allways will.    Update suggetion: can you please add  more lvls and every time you go up a lvl you get the same stuff but can unlock more of the game but you can diside what you can ulock as i think this will make it much more funnier.  can you also make the game better by letting ipad users join laptop users in clans as i have wwr on my ipad and laptop but on my ipad i cant join my clan that is on my laptop and its unfair so please can you add this in too. I think it will make the game much better thank you   PLEASE READ!!!!!",
        "I totally like the game and all but there must be balance between different robots especially..... some robots have a big advantage like the haechi with 3 medium slots and its dash ability.. its like u cant even aim at it......  Also please remove the components so that everyone is able to buy newer robots... u can make them available in gold or silver or even workshop points",
        "They have fine a great job with this game. The dynamics, the playability, the graphics, and it feels as if you could never stop growing. Every bot is beast with a certain load out and play style.  Update! After playing for over 3 years, and over many different platforms this game rocks. It's definitely not the mech its the pilot kinda game. The balance is good so if you spend money and level quickly you'll be placed on your mechs rating(mech level + weapon level) so take your time and learn some tactics. Every gun has its purpose but it takes a good pilot to make them work.",
        "Game is designed to milk money out of its players. Fun to play. But $200 for a pretend robot or $100 for a single gun. Lower prices. You might be shocked more people can afford 20 than 200......reply- you think giving someone 15 pieces of a random bot that takes 2 games to earn if you place first out of the 10000 you need. Only real option they give is purchas. Don't be fooled. This is a pay to win game.",
        "I like how the game has gotten better over past year in many ways.. But could you guys quit making the puzzle peice stuff to get newest goodies? I get you added lots of cool ways to get extras that's cool and all.. But who wants 7 puzzle pieces out of 7,000? Not worth the effort. Keep it gold and silver guys!!",
        "Game plays fine. No ability to choose mode is a major letdown. I did the $20 test to see if you can actually buy anything valuable. The answer is no. The game is geared towards the have money people. Update 2/23/2018  The queing is under 10 seconds. After Lunar New Year update you can earn upgrades better.  Discounts on purchase items is better."

        "This game is the only one of it's kind that I've ever really gotten into. But I fell in love with it and have gotten some real cool friends out of it. They really have thought everything thru and keep improving the game play consistently. Other than not explaining a few parts of the game enough I really don't have any complaints.  You really don't have to spend money, as long as you are an active player an devote enough time to it. And from what I have heard about other games it's not quite as crazy of a $$$ spong as some other games my brother plays. Over all I think this if a great game and I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for that new game to occupy your boredom & spare time. I give it a 9 outta 10.",

The cloths aren't that bad, but they can be a little more pretty. They should make it for boys and girls, so you can dress up boys, and maybe the boys can take a girl on a date so, they could get married and then they can have children but, it would be a life cycle! They would start out as babies and grow on and get married!!! Hope you like my feedback!! P.S. Plz update the game!!!",

        "Th8s game is awesome, it is the best ever!!! But can you add some more cars like the new Cadillacs(xts, xts, xt5, possibly ct6)  in the next update. The only gripe that I have about the game is that the mustang, camaro, and Audi tts seem way too expensive, and the camaro looks weird and boxy in the game. Besides that, the game is amazing!!üòÄ The graphics are amazing, the controls are precise and realistic, weather and vehicle simulations are amazing, customization is awesome( though it could use more wheels, just a nitpick)  maps are very realistic, and the a.i. are unbelievably realistic( though they could use a better braking distance, though isn't that realistic, sorry just another nitpick). This game is far better than any other game in this category! And I just love the the new reverse parking camera, and parking sensors!",
        "cars are look as they are fake the graphics of the car are not at all good but driving school 2016 cars graphic is so good it look real it feels like real but in this very fishy and the steering control of this game damn! please fix it but i really like to play ovilex game but because of these reason am playing Real racing 3 by Electronic arts it very nice its graphic also really good plzzz fix it for me thank uü§ó",
        "This game is amazing! The only thing is I would like the other cars to drive a bit better because they don't all use their signaling lights and they drive at 1 speed all the time which is rather annoying when it's 70km and going 20 mph.  Please fix this thank you billions for this great game, it's recommended to anyone just looking for a non-racing driving game. Only non-racing game I found so thank you ITS WORTH YOUR DOWNLOAD THANK YOU LOVE YOU !!!!!!!",
        "Graphics are ok and physics are great. Only criticism: with slider pedals and clutch, the clutch has to be slid all the way down when changing gear, but it's a long travel and awkward to do, so you slide the gearstick into place but it doesn't shift. It needs to have a shorter travel and be slightly higher up the screen.",
        "I love the game. Just a thing, I would like some more affordable cars and more SUV's. It would also be great if we could get XP for using freeride, because I've done all the missions like 5 times already and you get tired of the same things over and over. For some reason my engine switch and mirror switch doesn't work.",
        "This game is soooo horrible i cant drive or turn just a lil bit without my car going cysco. Its sooo crazy fix it but for now i am not keeping this HORRIBLE game"

        "Love it! I remember saying to myself while playing Dog Hotel \"man I wish they'd make one for horses\" and you did!! I love the game play, a tad bit repetitive but over-all a fantastic job. I especially love the wide range of horse breeds (the unicorn was a surprise indeed), and how easy (but not too easy) it is to get Coins. Buying the horse breed pack really isn't that expensive, a fair price, and definitely affordable. Thank you, can't wait to what else you come up with!",
        "I live this game and hopefully you can make more improvements such as more to do. Also, I used $2.99 and bought the paddock expansion pack after I unlocked them all thinking there would be more to it and there wasn't!!  I want my money back. I'll keep the horse variety one but I want the money back regarding the expansion because there wasn't anything different after I bought it and you didn't have any kind of statement saying anything.",
        "I love horses and this horse game is soooo good! Its really fun!! But I think it needs more detail like when u do dressage and jumping u use a English saddle not a western but in the game they use a western saddle, in steed. And I think that u wouldn't need to pay for different horse breeds. Overall it needs to have more realistic details.",
        "Really repetitive, and all the horses are so similar and everything you do is always the same. The care tasks went quickly at least, but the riding style ones were dull and long. Graphics are very nice, just not much to do.",
        "Overall the apps OK but u guys seriously need to put more breeds of horses into the game for people who don't want to or can't pay for the horse packages and maybe if u guys like added a couple horses that were rejected and could stay at the hotel until a person came  and bought it to up our cash faster. Also maybe create a more diverse races\\obstacle course. And when the horses come in that need to be cleaned u could make their coats look filthy and shiny when they are cleaned to up the rating of the graphics",
        "My fav animal is horses and all but the only 1 thing I hated about this game is. 1st I would like more to do. If y'all fix it I will give ya'll 5 stars. :D but other then that I loved it.Oh and almost forgot I never get any other color of horse except Black and Grey I would like more colors pleasess"

        "It a great game that is a encourage yonger kids to be doctor one day.  However there are some things that can be inproved   1. Can the nurses can be controlled like the doctors  2. Can you add multiplayer please  3. Add a few more mini games  4. That the hospital can expand with every level up",
        "Good but it needs some work done I love the game I really think you should download it. But it  sometimes takes me out and back to my home screen , I think it a good game when I am bord I can play it and the other ones. I think it should use a little work so mines don't lag and take me out of it  after all it is great and fun I love it so much that I wish it will not take me out the game because it makes me sad a lot but I will not delete it because I like it. I will give it 5 Stars but it lags a lot. Wish you a have a fun time playing.",
        "I liked it but the nurse o no! She is so irritating u can't even control the nurse she always stands between u and never moves and the 2 nurse is always in the bathroom And in one time u have so many patients u can't even hold but if u like then ok",
        "Love it but It needs a lot of work like for instance the screen is sometimes small but I really do love the game it's like very special and how you can like teach little kids about hospitals and stuff I like your expertise Playmobil and that is the end of my paragraph peace out  homies",
        "Its a really good game but I have a few improvements firstly the first nurse I ever unlocked went straight to the bathroom and won't move so I think she's there for ever secondly nurses don't really do anything they just pretend to do something also its always the person in the same bed can't you have some variety? Finally the person at the door I can't actually get to...? I know this comment must be frustrating I'm trying not to be to pick but I think its for the best :-)"

(Including  new age outlaws ajd xpac too)and change the shirts of shawn and triple h into the dx shirts PLZ! I mostly think you'll  add these legends for RAW 25 years characters and rey as the royal rumble character!",
        "One of the best wwe games.. even better than immortals.. the difficulty level is always fair when competing with online rivals... gaining loot boxes is also perfect and  not very difficult... I obviously made some In app purchases so I could compete well... just wish to open a loot box and get 1 four star wrestler... things would get awesome I don't mind paying for it as well..",
        "The gameplay and controls are great!!! But it will be better if the themes of each superstar were added. One things that annoys me is that the superstars are rated very oddly....John Cena is rated less than Elias....How can it be so???!!! If the rating system of the game is fixed then definitely a 5 star for this game.",
        "Best Wrestling mobile game so far.  Looking forward to new superstars in the future like guys from the Hart Dungeon or more NWO and DX guys.  Or just bring back the Attitude Era days. Enjoying the game and looking forward to the Alliance feature, hoping that it will be available in the next few months.  Great Job Reliance team.  The Best is yet to come indeed.  üèÜ",
        "In the famous words of Ric Flair Wooo! This game is the best they got characters like AJ Styles to Characters like Goldberg and Mankind swipe control i like i like it all besides a few things the theme song for this game is terrible and i dont like how after you win the wrestlers theme song  doesn't play that would make it even better if you could update that",
        "A VERY GOOD GAME. VERY GOOD GRAPHICS. THIS IS THE BEST WWE OR FIGHTING I HAVE EVER PLAYED. ONLY THING IS MANY ATTACKS OF MANY WWE WRESTLER ARE NOT THERE LIKE STING'S SCORPION DEATH DROP AND MANKIND'S DOUBLE ARM DDT"

Would like to see sales for diamonds... I don't mind throwing a few bucks here and there for a game/app on a phone. Prices are a little steep IMO.....",
        "Good fun until you figure out that you only need to build area 52 up. At level 500 it jumps by 5000000% or something stupid. Meaning can clear a planet in just hours. Needs a different hook to it. After a few planets it's a bit stale.  The choices to buy in multiples of needs moving. With fat fingers I've caught the research aswel as hitting Max a few times",
        "It's a good time killer. The thing that makes me think about deleting this app is how it keeps overriding my phone. I keep turning notifications off for this app, but the game will turn them back on again. It's so annoying to have my phone buzz just to find out its just this stupid game telling me my scientists are done or waiting for a task.",
        "Usual game where numbers get ridiculous and good at killing time. Very good features and well balanced - so far. Like with many of these games nearer the later stages the completion time can be calculated and nobody wants to tap for 211 years to complete the next round. Hopefully this game sidesteps that.",
        "Update to previous review: Devs seem on it. After the last update there seemed to be a bug or two. A couple of us let them know and they fixed it within a week. Good game, come and go on your own time, well maintained. Thanks guys!  --------- I'd have to agree about the slow down for the red bacteria after the update. It used to come between 1.5 and 3 mins. Now I can go 10 minutes looking at the screen before one comes. It makes the game more of a waste of time than fun. Other than that, I was really liking it. Played it more than most games.",
        "Yes it's a tapper buy done is a very unique way and totally worth your time. The fact that your goal is to destroy planets and that you are sending all your energy to the planet makes sense that you have to start back up. Been playing for almost 3 months and I keep checking back in to destroy planets."

When i was building on that high score, the screen glitched and swiped a number of times, ruining the order of the numbers. This has happened on multiple occasions only in this app. It's not such a big problem for people that are newer, but when you've got big numbers, such as 8192, it makes the game unplayable.",
        "The game is great, but the leaderboards are seriously messed up.  The top high scores are literally orders of magnitude higher than it is physically possible to get.  I would assume that they have been \"hacked\" somehow to display these fake scores.  The developer should cap the high score at the number that is literally the highest possible score (based on the size of the board)",
        "Awesome game I have basically mastered this game. Got a high score of 2,892,204. I made the highest tile which is 131,072. This game is amazing and requires intense focus. I lost focus for a second and a 4 appeared and I didn't notice. Messed me up when I was about to make the 65k tile",

        "Seriously i have been playing this game since 2014. This time round after the lastest update the game its becoming more stupid. Its so so so difficult to change players during games. Changing players it take time  and very sensitive. I perfer the previous update on changing players. Just imagine to change a player during game time 67 min it take me till the game end and i cant get to change. I keep putting the player on but it keep not happening. Please fix it! I keep losing points just because of the update.",
        "I downloaded this game in 2013. Deleted it cz they were really greedy. I downloaded again a few months ago and now deleted for good. The games are fixed, no matter how much you win they will never give u tokens. Very stingy, greedy and disgusting people. DO NOT DOWNLOAD IT. I understand that some apps are not free but you do not have to rob people to make money",
        "This game is indefinitely one of the worst football simulation games ever created. Idk if you guys are just a bunch of morons just naive about football. My team has the highest rating and the highest team value and yet still I'm losing to a low rate team. So pathetic. I play this game every single day and the mangers I face are not even active but they win against my team. Who wrote the algorithm for the game. Come on !! MORONS",
        "Transfer market is totally unacceptable. How can lower level managers come to higher level players auctions. You have right to use real photo profile? If looks like all are faint account in player transfer market.",
        "I don't understand players morale policy in this game!?! When I beat opponent with 4:0, some of players drops one morale point, even if they had excellent stats. Shouldn't morale rise after good game. Most annoying is losing morale overnight. WHY????",
        "The more I play the more annoying this game is. You have to spend silly money in order to build your team otherwise it's pointless. Losing interest very fast ... asking for 1900 tokens for an assistant manager recommended player ! Ridiculous"

Despite the lengthy and slow \"click the cloud\" interactions with in-game characters, instructions are so minimal that you get very bored with working out what you are supposed to do.  Graphics aren't really impressive, and although it is perfectly easy to understand how to move your character around the screen, doing so in these ways is a pain. I really wanted to like this game, but frankly it feels a bit like playing something a couple of decades older.",

My only complaint is the new continuation thing. That wasn't there but now it's forced me to watch ads even though I played to remove ads.",
        "I originally had it as 5 stars, but I noticed the longer that I've had the game, the more bugs I'm starting to see. Sometimes the music won't line up with the levels, which is the point of the game, and other times the game won't register my touch and will screw up my progress. If this gets fixed that would be great, and I'd move the rating back to 5 stars!",
        "I really wish you guys didn't update it. It truthfully bugs me that I can't listen to the full song on the menu anymore. The songs are absolutely amazing and the game is very addictive. I hope you will update the game again so that we can just sit and listen to these master pieces if we wanted. Thanks for an awesome game!",
        "Amazing game... Loved it...üòç The tunes are AWESOME!!!  And Bryan swag zone At first even I thought that But... It is a maze so it'll obviously be twisted... (No Hate) It is actually that you should click maybe after the third or fourth turn to get it right... Even I took time to understand that So it's okay üòä",
        "It's an amazing game. Sure I run around my bedroom screening every time I fail next to the end.... but there is something about this game that makes you happy. Is it the music? Maybe. Is it the back ground and the way it moves?possibly. It's all of those things plus more   In a nut shell I really really really really really really really really really love this game :p",
        "Good songs. That's about it. The hitbox detection and lag spikes are horrific, the checkpoint system is a blatant cash grab, and what annoys the most is that the timing of music+taps (the core mechanic of the game) is completely broken. It is significantly easier to play the game with audio off, so that you don't get distracted by the miss timed turns. Doesn't even fulfill it's most basic selling point. Atrocious."

        "Love all the delicious Emily games, however I don't like how you have to connect to Facebook to earn a trophy, and some of the game controls didn't work correctly all the time. The swipe motion didn't seem to work very well on a lot of levels making me replay the same level multiple times because swipe wouldn't work and would mess up the whole level. I almost deleted it because of this but I'm glad I stuck with it.",
        "i just started to play the game and was really enjoying it. Nice story line and fun to play. Then it got to the point at level 2 where the crib section was and the ads stop loading try again later. I keep trying to go back after waiting to play and it still gives me the same response. $10 to pay for a game is extremely expensive, I have never seen a game on google play for that amount of money. Most are free or free trial but not at the rate you guys charge. Seriously? you guys need to be more reasonable because the majority of your players are kids. So a word to the developer. If you want to attract and keep your content enjoyable for all ages, make it affordable to all young and old. Im just saying. I myself enjoyed the game overall, but I honestly will not pay that amount to play the game when there are so many other games to play that are free for all.",
        "Great game, love the back story and the different levels. Only issue was on level 51 the story telling part/intro didn't work, there was no dialogue, all I could do was press skip. I tried updating the app and clear the cache and it still didn't work.",
        "I love this game! Storylines amazing, graphics amazing, levels amazing, music amazing... the only problems I had with the game were a couple glitches with the advertisements, and level and i had to skip level 51 because of some weird glitch,  but otherwise the game was the best!",
        "I think it is hard for few people to purchase it. I personally love thus game but cannot purchase it. I hope and request game house to remove those purchase things will be removed so that I can play easily and so as other people.",
        "I really love this game! It is so fun! But sometimes when I click on a level is says ad failed to load so I can't play"

        "Very good game. I have a level 20 indominus rex even though I'm only level 50. and I'm trying to evolve it to level 40. I think that the element of creating your own hybrids is amazing. I think my personal favourites are yudon, indominus rex and ostaposaurus (in the game) and majungasaurus, T-rex and triceratops (that I have currently)  My only complaint is there's no aquatic, cenozoic or solid gold hybrids which I think would add a cool aspect to the game. And maybe some super hybrids made from 2 of the normal hybrids. (Recent) now for some reason I can't claim my reward for the Acanthostega tournament even though my game is updated to the latest version. Please fix this or send an email suggesting to/telling me what happened to stop me from getting my reward.",
        ".     It doesn't tell you how to get past level 75. Or how super power your dinosaurs,  example the opponents dinosaurs that have the purple glow. Also unable to redeem the points on either visitor world or the world ran by facebook. Jurrassic World the game also doesn't tell or show you how to get your dinosaurs to the ultimate stage where  these issues. That's why they get a poor rating from this consumer. If everyone boycotted the game and cancelled their memberships, you can guarantee they would fix all glitches and explain away the issues that are asked.",
        "I was enjoying this game for 5 minutes, and then I couldn't get into it anymore. It tells me to make more then 900 mb space even though I just deleted a couple of gb worth of apps. Once I can play this again it will be fun",
        "It's a great game but it's such a money pit. 9 out of 10 times if you want something, you better get a credit card out otherwise you're waiting 4 days to unlock it. If it weren't for that, I'd have given 5 stars.",
        "Look it's good but the tournament is way to hard because I have to fight halos and a level 10 I rex and I only have 3 legendary and when they lose I only have a super rare and commons so why when I have this it a good idea to put a person who has one hybrid halo and two legendary. It's just hard okay to win this dinosaur.",
        "My only serious problem right now is the arena fighting. Like it doesnt make sense that the person im fighting (non online) starts with 2 points to spend it gives an unfair advantage and i cant get past stage 9, even though i have much stronger dinos"

        "This game is so perfect when it comes to graphics, gameplay and physics.. But the only problem is that the items we can buy by using coins is limited. What i mean by that is, almost all of the items are being sold by gold tickets (which i cant top-up) . please add more items that can be bought by silver coins.. I have like 16.5k on my acc and i have nthing to buy... Please read this and make this possible ..if possible thankyou..!",
        "ok ok ok ok. this game is jackpot man i love it very very much. butttt....I HAVE SOME SERIOUS PROBLEM. I cnt save my progress damn it. when i touch \"user\"icon it automatically goes back to start page. SOS A LITTLE HELP HERE??!! My phone is samsung android version 4.3",
        "It's a good fun game. Just having issues on the Galaxy J3 Prime in terms of the main menu screen. I'm not able to do any sort of action on the main screen. It will not show my character nor any other character when match making. Really bad update that was released just recently. Please fix soon! Leisure mode is pretty much all i can play because of this error.",
        "Soo many glitches.  1) items are not getting picked up. 2) automatically transfer me to places I been before. 3) sometimes i just die before i even touch the ground. 4) keep teleporting me away from my target  area. Sooo disappointed.. there are much better similar games which is working fine.",
        "It's a really good game it worked really fast and smooth on my Alcatel firece4... just please try to make a update so it can run smoothly and fix the framerate so it doesn't lag so much on my LG Phoenix 3 it kicks me out sometimes from it lagging too much :( other than that its one the best games I played!",
        "Nice job developers! After that small update you've screwed up the loading screen! There's isn't a start button and other selections like shop, warehouse, etc those are bugged out also. Next time, tell us when there's an update even those small ones its happens unexpected. Fix it ASAP"

Please review and update database of words you have and reduce amount of ads...and than you will get five stars from me..",

        "I m so excited to unveil what happens next, the energy drains hell too quick. I would love if the energy is increased to a lot more because that is effecting the gameplay and annoys me a lot personally. Leaving this issue, the game is fantastic. I have always loved choice games and this current gameplay is the best of all experiences . I wish to read more through your stories..... ‚ù§",
        "I think this game is really good. I just have one problem. Even though it says my energy is full, it feels like I have nothing. And also the mini game 100 energy seems to last longer than the initial 300 you receive. If you could fix this taht would be great. And if it's designed like this can you make energy spending more efficient?",
        "This game really addictive!! The only problem is they don't give you enough energy.üòíyou either have to buy energy or play a mini game to get more energy. The highest energy points that you can get is 100. Plus the 30 points if you watch a video. Other than that the game is AMAZING. The graphics are realistic. It has a lot of romance too. You should definitely download this game if you're not bothered about the energy points.",
        "Fun game but like everyone else says the amount of energy is horrible. 430 energy for 24 hrs and it's gone within a minute or two. Really wish they'd give more energy. I've honestly thought about quitting like others but the storyline has been good. How about increasing the energy up and might have more people play.",
        "The game is super stingy on energy. When I finally caved in and bought the energy (about 20 dollars worth) I received nothing. I tried to email them, which they told me I had to send the request through the support tab in the game, did that too and again, nothing. No help and very costly.",
        "The story-writing is really well done and the art is gorgeous. My only problem is that if you don't plan on spending money to buy energy, the story moves really slow even if you get full points on the card mini game and watch the offered video ad. I guess that's the idea, though, since it tempts one to spend the money to keep reading. I also get really confused with the plot, itself. Sometimes the direction it goes doesn't make sense to me and also, the choices sometimes do something I wasn't expecting at all given the wording."

        "Saw in Facebook and thought I would give it a try. I am now addicted. I love how realistic they make the interaction seem. The only things that would make it better is if it would let us type our own responses and the system understood them and was able to respond and if there was actually more \"proving innocence\" and less tetrisy type games.. But that doesn't not effect my interest at all. Most addictive and fun game I have found. Will def recommend",
        "UPDATE : Changed from 5 stars to 3 because of the puzzles. As you get further into the game, it is obvious that you are supposed to spend money because you are literally not given enough of the right color blocks to complete the puzzles without purchased hacks. That really sucks. Too bad.    This is an interesting game with some unique interfaces and an engrossing plot. You interact with the other characters (in-game AI) via chat, and telephone (in-game AI) to learn the plot and your place in it. In order to access the info you need to move forward, you have to solve puzzles. Very cool, love it.",
        "It is great, nice and interesting story that makes me keep playing. What really bothers me is the fact that the puzzle takes FOREVER to solve. I know that the farther you are in a game the harder it gets, but it's just not logic to collect 25 pieces of each color at a puzzle and they only throw you 15-20 pieces and in such little amount of moves. The only way to solve it is spending money buying hacks or having too much patience. I would have deleted it long time ago if it wasn't for the story.",
        "This game is great. It's my favorite game of all thus far. I love this game. It's so addicting and the story line is perfect. I love how you can text and also receive/make calls. Great game for people who like puzzles and mystery. Passes the time quickly. Only thing I am having problems with is trying to link it to my facebook. The first time I had this game I had gotten pretty far and logged in with ease, long story short, got a new phone, installed my game, try to connect to my facebook for my saved game and.... my phone glitches and shuts me out. So I had to start over. Other than that this game is great I would recommend to anyone.",
        "I like the idea but the responses are off quite often. For example: \"Please don't hang up!\" -I'm here \"I don't know! Not a clue. Doesn't make sense and breaks the immersion.   It's another game similar to SIM - Sara is Missing, which I'd recommend for now. It's more polished and engaging. The characters are more distinct than in I Am Innocent.  This just seems to be designed to make you spend cash eventually, not because someone actually enjoyed developing it.",
        "It's honestly pretty good. It's rare that an app game keeps my attention for more than a week, but this one has kept me going for a while now. The story is interesting enough for me to keep going with the puzzles, however, I would like a little more writing and editing to be done with the dialogue. It can be kinda regular and break immersion. But it's still entertaining."

There are so many casually wholesome moments throughout it, like a homeless man will come in once in a while and you can decide if you'll give him pizza even though he can't pay. There's people of different sizes, races, cultures. I would die if the game makers made a version of this game but in a coffee shop",
        "I used to really love this game but the difficulty of the game is a little ridiculous. It would really help if the customers who didn't like the pizza say what was wrong with it so I could know what to fix.",
        "Very nice! I love the art, cute voices and the game play!  Non I have seen from the others yet that are just bunches of copycats lol. I'm just into my first hour so  I might change my mind xD",
        "Doesn't like this new update. It ruin my gameplay. My hired buddies is not working at all. I manually put the toppings on the pizza. I did buy all the upgrades before the update. Now i earn less than before. Hope you bring back the one tap auto  toppings. Oh and I'm glad that you didn't remove the auto slice buddy. It's the only upgrade that helps you slice better, not \"MANUALLY\".",
        "Well, the customers are retarded. These little brats don't talk about what do they want. It's unclear. But the gameplay and graphics are pretty good, so here you go 3 stars",
        "While I was playing, my phone battery died and my phone shut off. After turning my phone back on, I now can't open the app. When I click on the shortcut, it opens up a black screen for a few seconds and then exits it the app completely and I get a notification saying \"Pizza has stopped\" it's done this a dozen or so times now even after waiting a day. I would just uninstall and reinstall, but I'm scared I'll lose my progress. If my progress is saved to my Google play account, will I be able to get it back?"

        "I think this game is pretty cool! Also they added more houses to play in. I love multi-player because I like to see all the scores and I don't like the office because their's spiders and I hate spiders. I beat the Christmas level and I'm trying to beat the other levels too. But when you start the game, it says choose cat and press it and there's a skinny cat with the ears    down. I choose the kitten. But I LOVE the garden level because you go on the slides and you can go in the house and go out of it and go on the carousel and more! But on the picture when you download the game, the cat is in the washer and in the fridge. But you can't do that in the game. I tried too. Its boring at first but it's fun! I also don't know where the cats house is. Is it in the first house? I TOTALLY love it.üòÄüòÄüòÄüòÄüòÄüòÄüòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅüò∫üò∫üò∫üò∫üò∫üò∫üò∏üò∏üò∏üò∏üò∏üò∏üòªüòª",

        "It would be better if there were more tile choices, besides the basic 3. What really annoys me is that if you pause for a few seconds to look up or think of a move, an ad pops up. A 30 second, non skipable ad. The ads are also there after you finish every match. I know you need to make revenue but jeez. Calm down.",

So brilliant game but just be careful what you choose!"

I always make sure I download game whenever I upgrade to a new phone...it doesn't bother me to start all over bcuz I could play this game from beginning to end everyday!!

Lol...i HOPE SO!!!",

However, I was hoping that it would be more realistic, fun and free. It turns out that it's a P2P game and that took my surprise because it really is unfortunate. I hope they improve the gameplay and graphics. More updates will definitely bring more players.",
        "I have been plying this game for years i love it and quite often play more than once a day. The graphics are great as are all the challenges i hopr you bring the gifts for visiting you friends towns back i hopr this game goes on for a long time most of my family play to x",
        "Crafted a straight trench & boom my crafty points disappeared The IRS radius shortened, clicking finished jobs doesnt redirect me to the Toon player. Train tracks cant be crafted anymore. The Claw machine gives Bowling shoes WTH. Maka Sprungfuld gret agan!",
        "I found my old account, used some money, couldn't log in no more,  deleted the game, now it won't even download. I can not recommend this type of gaming. I'm trying to get online more than I can play. For me this is frustrating and hilarious. I guess I will find a similar game and rater use my money and time there?",
        "Great game for Simpsons fans. But what kills the fun are constantly new side missions. Just as you finished one, two new shows up. You can never concentrate on what's most important and that's building the Springfield but rather playing with some ruffians at the time now.",
        "I used to give this a 5 star rating but at level 150 I maxed out the amount of items I can have in my Springfield. Playing the game at this stage is pretty useless. I'm not a hoarder, my Springfield is beautifully arranged so there is no way I will delete things in order to build new houses or place new items. Will come back when the cap is increased but for now I'm sadly forced to take a break."

The program component can be a standard score from the AI judges yet will be under review by fans (other players who can add to the overall score, max 4 points only). Lastly, there should be a season that features state, regional, national, world, and finally olympic competition based on the current judging system for the short program and free skate [150-164 meh, 165-174 is okay, 175-189 is very good, 190-199 is excellent, and 200+ is \"strictly Russian\" (Weir, NBC 2018 Winter Olympics)]! Each event should have qualification rounds to add to the nerves of each skater! ( =",

Also i dont like having to pay to get the thinks and to many thinks are whach a vidio to get the thinks it takes to long so i dont l0play it that often. I hope u understand what I'm going through please fix the game up a bit üòÑ",

        "So It's a good game and all but after I reached 1687 fans my coach keeps saying after each round \"let's make me the best skater ever!\" Shouldn't it be changing up? And also should it be me saying that instead of the coach??",
        "Very dissatisfied... I unlocked almost everything I could through watching videos yesterday, and I open the game today and NOTHING is unlocked! So EVERY time you close the game you have to start over? No thanks! Good bye! YOU SUCK with your ad ridden games! Will not be downloading another of yours!",

Bugs: Pineapples that give you coins don't register as pineapple hits for the counters. There's a glitch where the fruit jumps to the opposite side of the screen. Graphics bite the big one though.. fix it",
        "Addictive  I play this game everyday when I wake up. I find it flawless, I have had no problems with this game, not even adds! The only thing I dislike is the title ( it did not effect my rate), why is it only pineapple pen? What happens to apple pen and PPAP? Anyway I love the modes and pens ( the surfboard is my fav pen) one again they are flawless. I think that Ketchapp is pure genius.",
        "Its good but nobody is changing the theme. Back to normal. Its still christmas. It seems like an abandoned game yet i think it was pretty popular among non ketchapp game players. If ur not going to keep up with the changing theme at least put it back to regular n take it off holiday.",
        "Fun and addictive but... Very fun and addictive game except for the fact that it takes approximately 60.56 MB... an app this small (but still amazing) shouldnt consume that much of my space. Unless you have more items in the games files which will be soon added, but if its not that than Im... puzzled.",
        "BEST GAME EVER!!! (one of the best games ever) it doesn't have any adds which is great! Love all the different types of pineapples & apples. What's bad about this game? Nothing. Which is good especially for me because I'm not that patient. I would recommend that you should have this game.",

Everytime I set a new and higher record I want to achieve and I only stop until I get there xD atm with 6400 coins and everything unlocked üòÅüòÅ please release new content for months and months!!

        "These other reviewers are jerks! Lol. The game is awesome! And my 4 year old can even play it well!  I like it so much, I'm downloading it onto my phone (4 yr old plays it on my old phone)  just to see how far I can get lol",
        "I would get to the title page and that was it. It won't let me go further. I have turned my phone off and back on and I have uninstalled it twice and installed it 3 times. Please fix.",
        "The game controls are very annoying. The character won't go where you want him to. During the boss fight he keeps getting stuck near the door even though I press the control for him to move forward. Plus the controls on the right hand part of the screen are too close to the controls on the phone, so if your finger moves a but too much other apps are popping open when you don't want them to and the game app is closing. Found the jumping upward on level 2 very awkward. Character didn't want to move forward during the jumps. So your continuous trying to climb and starting over if you miss a jump.",
        "It's an disaster game. It doesn't even open on my phone...it just stuck all the time.",
        "So, this game is very exciting, but i have problems with defeating the monsters, and after this \"update\" nothing changed, so next time make new levels! I MEAN, COME ON !! Other than that, game is great."

        "So I'm changing my review. After the past few updates I have won more special dice!! They lowered the level from extra impossible to meduim on the dice Masters, so it's a tad bit more fair! The only problem need, is the daily challenge is too much for the app to stay open. It force closes due to over processing or something, and I'd rather not have the daily challenge and the game work lol. But definitely gaining more stars each update from me!!",
        "I have downloaded and uninstalled it and did the same process over again and I still can't play it. It keeps telling me that it needs an active internet connection to play. Well, I can play my other internet based mobile games and I am writing this review from the same mobile device and everything else that requires internet is working so it is a fault in the game itself. It's a shame because I really wanted to play this but now I am going to uninstall it and not bother with it again because it is frustrating me. If the issue gets fixed somehow then I may think about playing it.",
        "GAME CODE reveals ROLLS ARE NOT RANDOM - they're pulled from a table of predertirmined outcomes, designed to MILK YOU FOR MONEY at a set rate, based on PvP, reg. Game, Event, Boss, etc.  Just like slot machines & video poker (which i programme).  You must 'assemble' high scoring games, like a puzzle, with majority of yahtzees sitting after 4 or 8 rolls (1 or 7 bonus 'dice'(money) spent)... Like a choose your own adventure book that can cost Hundreds of Dollars.",
        "This game is fun but I don't know if it's a bug or they're doing it on purpose but it seems like you can never win the extra challenges they do to win prizes.  I have watched the game say I lost when there's no way the computer opponent could have gotten enough points to be me. I messaged the game creators about it and never got a response. I'm about to uninstall this game.",
        "This game cheats! Don't get me wrong, I love it and am going to keep playing. But WAY more often than it should, it tallies up your opponents score wrong to make you lose. I count and take screen shots. If you get upset at things like that, it isn't for you. But if you don't care that much, like me, it's absolute fun! Adorable names given! Awesome dice to win! Very entertaining! Battle real people or the game! Just don't be a sore loser even when mathematically your a winner!",
        "I'll give this game more than one star once the showdowns are less about the computer clearing and more about real challenge.  Once you start a showdown the computer conveniently never gets a bad roll.  Which wouldn't be a big deal except you have to wait to challenge them again unless you want to pay for extra dice which is used to unlock everything else.  Kinda cheap."

        "I like this game, I really do. It is intense and fun, but the ads are a little too intrusive, if I connect to a game and the players disconnects before the map starts - you get an ad. I do understand that the game is free and all and I want the game to have ads to support the game, but this game has the most ads of any other game I know, so please atleast have a limit to the ads shown a day or have it shown every 2 games. Also I think it would be cool to have an option to watch a couple of ads to get a club ticket or have it to speed up the 24 hour cool down on the club arenas. Overall this game is really fun and I hope Ninja Kiwi keeps improving it.",
        "The only thing I do not like is how you need the vip membership to use the special modes, which I get you guys need money to keep it going but I think like one day a week there it should he free for that day or and hour or two. Keep up the good work Ninja Kiwi üòä",
        "You have hackers playing this game. I just played a game against a guy who ballons kept passing all his towers but no points came out of his health. I rember why I delted this game in first place. I could have a ton of gallons go thru people's line and they not lose health.",
        "FORCED ADS! I loved playing this game for years but had to bring the rating down atleast one star because of the forced ads that I usually refuse to watch in games. So now my sessions playing this game end as soon as an ad shows up. Very disappointed.",

        "In assault mode in round 13/14 every player can send a wave of bloons that is too strong to be stopped. They save up cash and send a huge wave while the players haven't even been able to develop an appropriate defense ergo it gives them no chance to win. This has happened to me 4 times in a row now this morning and the game seriously gets boring since there is no way to fight this kind of wave of. Hope you consider this note and make some changes .

About the ads: I have premium, and I only have to watch an ad if I choose to get a reward in return. There are no sudde, unwanted or random ads anymore.",
        "Simple game. Ads galore. Also when ads pop up better not be listening to music because it's gonna pause your music even if the ad has 0 sound. Thus the one star rating. You can advertise all you want but don't interrupt any background apps to force me to look at your ad. That's just messed up.",
        "Not the most challenging game but its okay if you need something to do on the toilet. Unfortunately there is only ONE menu to open for the entire game and every time you click on it you are forced to watch an advert. EVERY TIME!!! i wouldnt give this game 5 stars in a hurry but the constant bombardment of adverts kills what would otherwise be a far mkre decent game.  Side note: yes i know there is a premium version which is basically the same game but without ads. This isnt a game i would spend money on and definately not (at least to me) worth killing with adverts.",
        "First of all the game it self is a great little game. Graphics are fine game play is simple and easy to pick up it's a good game. Now for the reason it only gets two stars. WAY TO MANY ADS! I mean for f@$k sake every two seconds there's an ad. Click on the car buying button there's an ad. Sit there to long there's an ad. I understand this is how you make your money but come on there's a line and you didn't just cross it you swan dived over that bad boy. I'm sorry but I do not recommended this game for anyone.",
        "Potential to be a great game but wayyyy to many ads, like every 10 seconds of gameplay there's a 30 second ad, and when you choose to watch an ad to get a reward you never actually get it. Waste of time. No idol earnings so you have to have the app open to advance and forces you to watch more ads.i get you want to make money but this app is basically unplayable.",
        "Not had too much of a problem with ads, but that might be because my game doesn't progress after dragging the car onto the race track.  Just keeps going in circles, and won't allow me to remove it after track, no matter if its gone pass finish line or not."

        "Great game app!",
        "I love playing slot machine games, and Pop Slots feels like the only game that does not immediately shoot me down when I get a little crazy/ ambitious with my betting. It is the ONLY game I have ever played where I've hit the jackpots on multiple occasions. Now maybe it's all completely luck on my part, but it feels like a game that doesn't immediately take all of your money faster than you can collect it. It's very easy to level up with a good win streak, and those hourly and daily bonus grow pretty quickly. Love this game!",
        "Used to be fun to play when there were decent rewards. For some reason the comp room rewards are gone besides small discount options. Ticket rewards are available for shows nobody would want to pay to see.  I have been playing for a few years now and have saved up quite few loyalty points. I guess we are playing for an occasional comp buffet. What a shame",
        "I like this game..but once i got to a certain level my daily bonus stopped going up.  It has reamined the same and it would be a little more exciting if it would increase the higher you go.  Win or lose is ok with me, it's something to pass free time.",
        "Game is really fun to play probably my favorite, and is the best slot machine app. I've been playing at least 5 years But have recently stopped because it's not fun if you hardly win. And I totally get that it's supposed to be like Vegas, Win some could lose a lot. But it's just a game, it's for entertainment and I get that you can redeem the gold chips for real rewards in Vegas, but that's not why I play. I play because the games and different casinos are fun along with the bonuses. I spend 11 million just to play the pirate gem bonus and only win back 5 million. I could really care less how frequent the gold chips are, you only get 1 in 4ish balloons anyway. I just want to PLAYYY. Especially the bonuses, but it takes forever sometimes for them to be triggered in some casinos. Any chance it can change?",
        "Like almost everyone else on here I loved this game until recently.  Like tonight for instance I was playing mostly the 7s slots.  In less than an hour betting at $120,000 to 180,000 max I went thru 45 million coins!!! I mean COME ON!!!  At the beginning when the payouts are generous I didn't mind purchasing coins,  tickets,  etc... But now forget it not going to spend one more dollar on this game."

        "Most puzzles are self explanatory. The odd few appeared to be impossible without some instruction. Few levels I had to skip probably around 7 levels. Couple due to pieces not moving or stuck. Very happy to be able to skip levels.  Would have been great to have a certain bank of hints for some of the  difficult ones. I found the later levels easier than the ones around 100. Max levels 120. Great fun!",
        "Not responsive to most touches. I finally got a cheat only to realize it was the game.  Ads were not frequent but had a strobe light going off (health issues) and would not turn off. Had to close out of the game every time so I just quit playing. Typo many similar more challenging games out there to try and work with this one.",
        "Some things are hidden in such a place makes it hard on note 8 due to curved screen. Level 89 doesn't work, as well as other levels where touching the same place over and over and over might get something to work.  Most puzzles are extremely easy,  it's just a matter of the game not working.",
        "Good concept but a lot of the puzzles are stupid or they totally don't work unless you restart the game which is annoying. There's so many glitches I felt like uninstalling so many times! I'm just glad it's over so i can get rid of this app. 3/10 wouldn't recommend",
        "Fun and challenging for awhile, but I found most of the levels after 50 impossible to figure out without a cheat sheet. Got frustrating. I'm at level 60 and about ready to throw in the towel.",
        "I play this game in 2hrs and got stuck on level 42. It's challenge your mind. It's good for you, if you like doing brain games.. It helps you think about.. Like you really have to think about it or you will get stuck. But all the above, it's a awesome awesome game."

Can u add more weather effects and timings like sunset, rain, snow etc. The wipers lie unused in cockpit! What abt adding lights to airplanes -nav, position lights? Some real life airline like texture could be added to make it better.        Overall, one of the best bet for airplane enthusiasts!",
        "Well, THAT. IS. AWESOME ! I suggest to continue developing this game...that about multiplayer mode? What about if you can get money from flights , to buy new planes ? That about making new aircraft types? For example: very big planes can take more passengers to get more money but have low speeds? And other planes which are fast but with less passengers ? And best of all, why not if there is a big map which many players (about 1000 maybe) can buy airports , and transport people to different players airports? Please try and make at least some ideas into ACTION! (Not kidding, this can make the game a blast!) .......I am also sorry for people who find this hard but with some practice you can be an expert!",
        "Its quite good but a little bit of fixing will do. The part \"Slow Down thing\" can you please please place that where it can not block the view of the player. It is very difficult to see whats behind it so it causes us players to crash. T.Y",

        "Thanks j park. I was just confused that which game to play. All were bad. Finally i thought that ur game can be  good so i installed it and played it.so nice it is!!!love it . First i thought playing  this game can be hard because it has so many buttons and how to play it but i did not had any choice and i played ur game. I felt like never deleting  it even i have completed this game . I understood this game by pressing the help button.  I have become  an expert in this without any friends. I have the hulk friend only but i use it rarely.because of playing alone I am stuck in level 19 but i will try. If not possible I wl use hulk. Thank u veryyyyyyyyyyyyyy much!!!!!!‚ò∫‚ò∫üòäüòÉ.i just have a question to you that when can my player become hulk. Only when we buy game money or any other way?????üòûüòêplease tell fast",

        "I love it! Out of all the 4 versions my favorite is this one. And it does say 12+ but it really isn't that bad once you get use to it. I just learned to play these games a month ago and trust me you see a pattern of where they go. I haven't played it one night. But then again I have never been jump scared. And parents if your kid is 9 or 10 and they want this game I say go ahead and say yes! One of the best games ever!",
        "Creepy and super scary game! Wow!  This games is so awesome and fantastic because it does not log on my cellphone and so scary game!  My 2 nephew are having fun  with this game and actually when the time now is 3 am and the animatronics is going to move, they're so tense to watch the cctv because they will see chica the color yellow  bird looking at the camera!  So I give 5 stars to this game and to the Creator of this game.. keep the good work creating a game!  üòäüòâ",
        "This is the best game! Its way better than the first game because there's more anamictronics! Moreover instead of doors you get the hall and vents also you have to flash your light at foxy to get him away. You also have a mask to make chica,boany,mango,balloons boy, and Freddy. Mary and net is creepy as hell because she's kinda like Freddy in the first one like I mean she comes at you randomly like Freddy in the last one.",
        "Sucks. Ok,so I installed it,started it,and it kicked me off! pls make a new update so where it won't glitch and kick people off the game that's how u lose people and ur game becomes a lost cause. ..anyway,pls fix and I'll give five stars.(btw I can't even last through the phone call without getting kicked out of the game.)üò°üò≥üò°",
        "Very spooooooooky Great this game is great but you should really try doing an update about the purple guy cause it makes no sense that in SL at the end some one stares at a mirror and purple eyes cone out and the purple guy is the only one in the game who is purple! I don't know if that makes sense plus the mini games don't match because purple guys death was I n fnaf 3 so who is that person in the mirror? I know I mite be Mike or William Afton William Afton is the purple guy but Mike would make more sense cause  the scooper",
        "So scary. Good game. Look this game will scare you until you pee on yourself aka if your 11 and under like me should play if your not scared but,this game is good. I give it 5 stars no doubt. Lol but hurry up and come out with part 3 already plz!üòÄüòÄüòÄ F.Y.I always wind up the music box"

        "I Personally would like to have the ability to upgrade stars on heroes easier without spending real money. Get 2 to 3 stars on the characters for free leaves me wanting, and im just not spending money on a game like this. Otherwise it is a fun game. Even though it basically can be a full time job you dont make money on and have to spend money on. So if you dont mind commiting months to barely make it to do the late game stuff amd still have to spend months to progress. This game will be great. This review is for those who play ftp games without actually paying to win.",
        "So it's kinda fun but I'm rating it low based on the cost of purchasing character shards versus how many you get. I tested it out and purchased a ton of purple diamond things and purchased character shards that gives between 5 and 330. Out of 7 purchases at 1299 each, I got a total of 41 shards. So for roughly 9100 diamonds, I get 41 shards. You do the math. This game apparently enjoys taking your money. I've mentioned this to the developers with no reply. DC Legends knows what they're doing when it comes to purchases of character shards. At least they make it easier",
        "I love this game but an issue im having since the newest update os why im giving 2 stars at the moment. Ever since the update the game will not load. Says \"loading cantina\" then closes the app completely. Im gonna end up getting kicked out of my guild...please fix this! Soon as its fixed it will return it to 5 stars bc the overall game is badass!",
        "Very addictive. I started playing casually, and 4 weeks later I find myself checking it all the time. It's best played with at least a minor investment, but reasonably ftp...if you got patience.  Add: it's been six months, and I'm still hammering away at it. It has a huge base of fans,and I've only needed customer support once (and they handled my issue very well and quickly).  Still a bit grind-y, but great little bit of clicky gaming.",
        "The game is fun enough but to sync it with your Google account to have to give your phone and all its abilities to EA. Why is there a need for the game to access my photos and make and answer calls? How 'bout I play a game on my phone with cool light sabers and fun music and when I need to make a call I'll stop for a bit. Just let people play and EA can make bank with their microtransactions. GTFO of people's personal info.",
        "Great way to spend down time at work or at home. Really enjoy playing as characters from both light and dark side teaming up and defeating others. It does take awhile to get charcters leveled up. However can spend some money if you don't want to grind. However I find it rewarding grinding each day to get what i want."

        "Quick fire is the best but theres only one down fall, the seconds. When you get to the last seconds it doesnt give you your last strike and the other person wins.they should fix that.you have to score right on the 2 second count b4 you get ur last strike. Please fix it so peoples last strike can count, thank you, other than that its a great and awesome game to play to challenge your players. üëçüëçüåüüåüüåüüåüüåüüåüüåüüåüüåüüåüüåü...also the developer should add macau lanes, London lanes and pins..",
        "Had found a phone on the job sight and played the sample version. I HAD to download it as soon as I got access to my own shine. I play constantly!  Haven't gotten very far yet. Thing I DON'T like is you don't get an average..... IF you do, I've yet to find where it is in the game. That's in NO way a deal breaker. So, GO DOWNLOAD IT!  See for yourself just how additive & F-U-N it is!!! üòâüíØ",
        "Great graphics and realistic feel to the lanes. Controls are a bit wonky, however, and purists won't like being being able to steer the ball after it leaves your \"hand.\" LOTS of attempted upsells, but its free to play features ain't too bad on their own, either. All in all, a decent little bowling game.",
        "It's a  fun game but it's rigged. I think if you have a billion chips you shouldn't be able to play on lower lanes. I thought you were supposed to be matched up with people who are the same or close level. How is it I'm bowling against someone who is level 171 and 8 billion chips and  I'm level 43 .",
        "Amazing.  It's just fun watching the bowling hall whizz by and get a strike.  I've played and uninstalled this game, but the only reason for the uninstall part is storage.  For all of you who are new, try getting the ball between the front pin and either of the pins next to it, it usually gets strikes, but by strikes I mean doubles against level 7 Russians.",
        "This is a fun game however it allows people to cheat or it's rigged. It's no coincidence that the better I play the better my opponent plays. I think half the time we are playing a rigged computer. I spent $50 on this app in a week and I am deleting it now. Sorry crooked people that run this app."

        "This game is perfect for anyone who loves magic, fantasy, collecting, and a whole new level of adorable! Dragonvale takes everything to the next level! I highly recommend it, as it is a amazing game, my most played, and I hope everyone else enjoys it just as much as I do. Five stars! üåüüåüüåüüåüüåü Edit 2: I was re-organizing my islands by Element the other day, and I had just finished the Plant Island. I put down a Oversized Oak Tree, and immediately, a image flashed through my mind: a young girl, sitting on a branch of the oak tree, a book in one hand, a baby Plant dragon sitting next to her. Stretched out in front of them was my Plant Island, the dragons freely soaring, the other islands in the distance. And that sparked a inspiration in my head. I just wanted to ask; can I write a Dragonvale book, which takes place at my park? Please let me know !  :)",
        "Cmon Backflip! Okay look I love Dragonvale, I've been playing it forever. First off I lost my amazing park a while back and that really sucked. But now I am restarting and I go to buy the beginners pack for 9.99 and it says there was an error and i wont be charged...come to find out it did charge me and i didnt receive anything! Please help",
        "I have been playing for a while. After events you get a day to turn in your event specific currency for the prizes, even though the event has ended. Well for Gardenia's event, it turned in all my roses before I could exchange them. I had over 25,000 and was so pumped to get the new dragons. Now I don't have any roses and 25,000,000 extra coins i don't need. Please help. This is a very frustrating bug.",
        "I really love collecting all of the dragons and the fact that you can theme/decorate your park too. But the amount of types of decorations are unbalanced, the majority that you can currently buy in the market are just plant and earth type while there are very few decorations of the other types (such as air, cold, etc).",
        "When I first had it it was super fun. Then I saw a game I wanted so I deleted it I did that before and got it back I could log into facebook and go to my old island. But this time I could not. I was so far and looking forward to seeimg my dragons but it did not let me go to my old island. It left me im tears that I had to do what I did all over again. So I deleted this stupid game and gave this. If I could rate 0 I would",
        "its ok, and you might think you cant li e without it, but trust me.... after a while year of playing, which is what i have waited to wrote this review, the game play becomes very repetitive. sure try it out, its fun, but not something for the rest of your life. dont put money into it, you will regret ir later."

It is confusing if you pick paint or something it just goes back to the original colour. I didn't like how easy the drawings were and I don't think the glow art works. It just comes out as crayon. I wouldn't recommend this game if you don't like colouring. It's ok!!!!",

Also i think that one small part of the picture shouldn't color the whole background, because what if you didn't want them bother the same exact color, because no affence, but it looks weird and ugly sometimes. Sorry for no compliments.                    LOVE, YOUR DEAR FRIEND!!!",

I came acrossed this one from a Facebook add and as soon as I started playying it has been super fun every since. The p2w ratio is literally not high at all. So F2P can definitely gain just ad much. Awesome gameplay good graphics for the game itself overall I definitely recommend this game. ‚ô°",
        "This is one of the best rpgs out there in my opinion for a few reasons the graphics are very nice, rpgs whos graphics try to get really realistic are just not the same it looks blan likr that. My next reason is it isnt a pay to win game. For all of the people out there who like to pay a lot of money, its just dum. Money for a game should only be for cosmetic items to make you look really cool not to boost you 10 tens ahead of everyone, and for that I thank you Allstar gaming. Paying does get you a boost in game its just not very big the only reason rating s are so bad is cuz the top up didnt give them anything which is a huge bug.",
        "Had a question about something and got response from koram games that they want free to play players and paying members on same page! What an insult. Not to mention we can't shut off vip status I regret ever spending in this game! No gratitude for the customer we are treated like dirt. Not to mention we payers get harassed in game by free to play players daily! Show some respect to the people who give you a pay check.",

        "At the beginning there is no setting menu to turn off the annoying music, but there is a menu to give them money for VIP status. That's all I need to know this is a cash-grab.",
        "This game is awesome and a lot of fun. I've been playing for about a week and I can't stop playing it all day everyday. I'm looking forward to getting to higher levels and getting more good loot. Thanks for making this game!"

It is both good for Iphone and androisld users. The only thing bad about it was that your profile picture takes super long to load, so I gave up on that.",

        "Very fun.  I wish I could just do the Party games though.  They are much more fun as I prefer competing with a number of people, not just one.  Too hard to get enough tickets, though!  I get discouraged when no tickets/videos are available.",
        "Love this game! If you love music I really recommend downloading it. If your not so great at guessing songs then at least your getting music recommendations! Keep up the work guys",
        "Forced closed every five minutes in the middle of a game. Slowed my phone down. And made it extremely laggy and hot. Said I would put a bad review if it didn't stop. Here you go!",
        "Would be fantastic but it's sooooo damn laggy. My net is super fast, as is my phone but there's so many games the song plays without letting me click the answers or the answers are still sliding into view. Taking me 10 secs to answer a song I knew within the first damn bar. Absolutely infuriating. Surely the app should preload everything before making you start or perhaps it's just poorly made. The original was never like this and I'm sure it had a different developer. Also, I can't even change my pic, whenever I try it just freezes up. Very poor when it could be so much better."
