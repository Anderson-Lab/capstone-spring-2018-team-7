        "Don't spend a dime if you play this game.  Rates on character drops are rigged.  As you go up in rank they manipulate drop rates as they believe people who invest so much time will pay money to try and get better rather than quit.  This is a major issue.  You cannot do any real events without banner cards and the developers know this.  Again they manipulate rates based on account rank so as you go up in rank your chances go way way down.",
        "Updates keep getting stuck with the ver 3.8.1. Since it was released. Download 269 out of 269 but nothing happens after that, and a message of \"connection error\" keeps appearing. Have passed the daily log in bonus, and will probably lose the consecutive login bonuses as a result. Didn't create transfer code or link to fb account yet so may risk of losing account if I reinstall. Please fix this asap.",
        "This game is awesome however, today I was updating my app and I can't log in. It updated and say open than the app continues to try and update and wont. I can't even transfers it. I tried with internet and my data. I have more than enough storage but now all my time and effort has been wasted. And I feel \"great\"",
        "Tried transferring to new device, now the damn game won't download beyond the title screen and I've tried everything to get it to work. A pity too. I liked the game but I can't play it. All that time spent on my old phone, just gone.",
        "As promised I upped my 3 star to a 4 star because SSJ4 Gogeta is complete now. However it really kills the joy of the game to have to gather 5 of the same SSR to awaken all the way especially when I used some of them for super attack power increases. Find another way to fully unlock characters through the potential grid(maybe a tournament item) and you'll pull me back from Pokemon Duel.",
        "This gacha game involves summoning characters through a \"loot box\" system.  Most games now show rates so you know what you are getting in to.  For this game, however, it do not show the rates on this english version.  For now, just keep this in mind if you decide to spend money on this game.  Until this issue is fixed and until Google Play policies are updated to reflect showing rates in \"loot box\" based games, my review will remain as 1-star"

Keep it up, guys!   \"I love this game but the levels are often too hard to beat without power-up help, and it takes so long to earn coins. Most of my friends have quit playing\"",
        "Fun way to pass time and super addictive but most of the levels are insanely hard. Some can only be completed if you're lucky enough to get the bonus items in the right place. Also the safe box is getting on my nerves. I thought it was a limited time offer and would go away but it's been there for 2 weeks now!",
        "I Love Gardenscapes and It Is Fun Way to Be Creative.  A Recent Update has Made it Definitely Better.  The Support Team Has Been Exceptional With Quick Responses and Answers!  There is Room for Improvement in the Amount of Coins Obtained in Completing Tasks, as Well as Eliminating Repetitious Tasks Requiring More Moves.",
        "I love home scape but it can be quite spendy. Both games are fun.  Love graphics animation laughter now free gifts.  Gardens cape is even more fun doesn't get boring like home scape when pay to win is obvious.  Gardens scape takes 1 or 2 coins with easier quests.   Still favorite.  Home scapes got greedy please return again where its not pay to win.  At times we need a color no bonus and lose because home scape didn't offer the color.  Spending hundreds on home scape so thinking of my budget and returning to garden scape.  Gardens cape started it all. Please lower prices",
        "Either make the puzzles easier or give more Passes to actually be able to pass the level ....make it easier to get to other rooms, too many attention to details..also so many tokens should be able to buy a few stars... I've been on the same room level since I started playing and way past level 100. Starting to get bored at this point.",
        "The reward for finishing a puzzle is around 50 to 60 coins. It cost 900 coins for 5 extra turns, and 1200 for the next. It has taken me up to 3 weeks playing all my lives as much as possible to finish 1 puzzle. This game is designed to frustrate you into spending money so you can complete the puzzles. Which I wouldn't mind if it was rewarded more fairly. Play Monsterbusters, it is by far more fun, you earn better rewards, and you can buy new lives and power-ups with your coins at a much more fair rate."

Curious to see if they manage to respond properly this time",
        "I have been playing this for 1.5 years. I love everything about this game. They always have fun events - usually 2-3 events occur at the same time. You can play them all or pick the ones you like best. As a f2p the game presents many opportunities to acquire in game money (especially during the events) - hoard it for energy refreshes. You'll find yourself in very few dry spells needing in game money and energy.",
        "I love this game! I play at every opportunity I get. Thanks for helping me set up the game on my tablet. I have however, run into another issue I hope you can help me resolve. I have a three star awakened dark pixie, when I tried to evolved her into a three star I tried to use other pixies and they only leveled up her skills, so I used two other monsters to evolve her. This happened again when I tried to evolve her into a four star. Please help!",
        "If your into gathering  monsters to strengthen and fight aswell as evolve then this game is for you. It's very fair and rewarding depending on your efforts. Further expansions for this would see the current fans gain more pleasure out of it and it's already a great game. Liking they added 2 new monsters but seeing that as a regular thing and still keeping current top summons valid would be incredible. Speedy gameplay and no issues for me. Username : violentmaw",
        "Been playing this game for years. Really enjoyed for the first few years. But while years of time past, the rune drop rate and 5* monster summoning rate still remained very low. Its very sad and depressing. Now i just login to settle my guild wars then log off.",
        "Been playing this game every day and it's extremely addicting. Gameplay and graphics are wonderful, support is great, etc. However, it seems to have really become a pay to win game. You'd think that with all the mystical scrolls, summoning stones, attribute scrolls and crystal summonings I've been summoning, I'd at least get a natural 4 star character but i can't even get that. I get garbage every single time. Its frustrating when you put so much time into the game and get nothing in return."

For example i just been upgraded to th10, i dont have infernos , i dont have 3rd xbow and im getting maxed out th11 bases to raid in crystal league. Similarly maxed th11 players are raiding my base sucking all my loots with all maxed troops , lvl 50 king/queen and lvl 20 warden...This is because i dont invest money in this game.",
        "Hi COC. I love this game. This my only favourite game. And its the best in the world. I love when there are updated in the game. But I have a query this time. After Builder Hall 8 update whenever I click by boat to go Builder Base the game shuts. I am not able to upgrade my Builder hall. SUPERCELL you are super we know plz fix this issue and let me know. Plz reply to my review. And give interesting offers on normal base. There are no good offers now. I am very happy to be a memner of COC family. ~King SB  Clan~Ganking Geckos",
        "This is a perfect game..but you should give us a short way to make our town hall level 11.. You should give some event everyday.. make tournament.. what you have give us that is like a league not a tournament... Give a tournament Like football world cup.. first there will be group stage.. knock out stage .. that will make this game so much Enjoyable and more and more interesting.. This is a request to you #SUPERCELL PLZ MAKE THIS HAPPEN..THIS WILL MAKE THIS GAME A DREAM GAME.. MAKE IT HAPPEN SUPERCELL.. LOVE YOU",
        "HI SUPERCELL . some players ruined the clan because of Clan Games. Why? They will join ur clan and check if we already achieve the reward like book. They will earn 50 or 100 points and leave the clan. Pls do something about this issue. The CG rules should change like They will get the reward depend of how many points they earnd. Sample: 1500 points they get the reward from tier 1-3 even though the clan achieved the last tier. Pls fix it. Thanks",
        "Super game my favourite game really nice guys download it .I have A small request if we have got any bonus in war or Multiple battles it automatically goes in Clan Castle ,and when we want withdraw it give whole treasure comes out. So if U keep a device ,in which we can type how much  amount of  treasure we want to withdraw. It will be great honor if U put it in next update.",
        "A nice game. I will always be in search of games. My Friend recommend that this is nice game. I installed it. He said that join in my clan. I joined in his clan. Now I am playing this game wonderfully. Thank you super cell and coc. But only the problem is maintainance of server.  It says try again later.  That's why I have rated it 4★. Other wise iwll give 5★. But any way game is wonderful.        PLEASE INSTALL THIS GAME IT'S WONDERFUL GAME"

Makes you forget about the game sometimes as you can't do anything else untill it's complete. I refuse micro-transactions so this game now only gets visited once every couple of days. It's a shame really as it's great fun to start with.",

        "This game is not made for people who do not spend money. The devs do not control the players who do and therefore those who do not never get the chance to grow because they are constantly having to use resouces to rebuild their troops and this takes away from being able to advance. The kill event being 3 days straight is for the birds . You got to buy gold to purchase shields or you resouces you work for are plundered and often times your army is wounded above your hospital limit so you have to constantly use resouces to be able to heal them.  I just don't understand why the game is for people who spend a lot of money and destroy the ego of those who don't!",

Edit: I have already provided screen shots to you via the Help & Support board, you haven't yet taken action. Please do so immediately.",

        "The makers of this game have put their soul into it, bringing into life every element of the game. The characters are charming and beguiling. I'm in love with princess. 😁 It's the only game where I've invested real cash, and have received  its full worth. The game is an epic. I love it. Cons: Although I've purchased gems, and bought legendary chests, I've only received relatively less efficient cards like lava hound and graveyard which help in game play only if complemented with other cards. It's a bummer. I think they want me to spend more to enjoy more desirable cards.",
        "Well I like the game. It's fun and it is really tempting to open a really good chest because you can get a legendary. I have minor inferno dragon lava hound mega knight sparky and lumberjack. For example pretend your friend says don't open that ledendary chest wait until tomorrow . You just gotta open it. And Supercell it would be nice if I could get night witch.",
        "Think you should be. Given a legendary atrandom at start a,nd a random rare in chest would be cool was expecting that..but no just normal cards.hope I get  cool legendary one day.like. the chest idea hope you bring in armour card add on.like spear guy could have ice spear or flames.plus that's cool extract cards to collect to make your cards even better and unique. Thank you my supercell friend.this game oh almost,st forgot.bbbbbbbeest 2 v 2 game on mobile,!!!!!",
        "I don't think I need to 'review' much here. There are some points I definitely don't like about the game. Such as the matchmaking... You get matched with the same deck type in a row. Other than that and some minor flaws it's a great game. I love the competitive aspect about it.  Finally I would suggest some 2v2 with different game modes, such as ramp up 2v2. Also, add the rematch button in 2v2 challenges with random mates.  Hope I hit the 4,3k this season. Good luck to all clashers!",
        "I think Clash Royale is a great game to play and is very well put together for all ages, it is a fast paced game and at the same time can be played with an individual pace of your own to a degree being that there is a clock ticking, also new characters are released at a well balanced rate, so that the game doesn't become boring and the regular balance of the characters strengths and weaknesses are balanced to make the game more competitive. I recommend this game for all ages and abilities. It's great for a few minutes or an hour or so and this game also has several different tournaments you can enjoy yourself or with a friend or a teammate. See you soon on Clash Royale. A.K.A. Dad.",
        "Supercell, I think your best game is hay day. Clash royale on the other hand isn't one of your better games. Android is better than apple. Why would you ever support apple instead of android. You released Brawl Stars only for apple. You should have less medieval/fantasy games unless you make the knights, princes etc. More realistic. In my opinion I think you're better at making farm and army games. Please make more of those😖"

        "I absolutely love this game and have loved it since it came out. I was never too much into Pokemon but this game has made me love everything about it. It's great meeting new people when doing raids and the new gym system is much better. My only improvement would be maybe to make it a little easier to do raids in rural areas. Perhaps lowering the CP, or giving a person more time to complete it alone compared to in a big group. Can't please everyone though! Keep going Niantic, we love you!",
        "I impatiently waited for this game for nearly 2 years. I play it with my 2 best friends and it's changed our lives for the better. We get out more and get much more exercise these days. I love collecting Pokémon and I intend to play Pokémon Go forever. Niantic hasn't yet delivered on all their promises, but they're working diligently and I'm very happy with the game so far.",
        "The battle is rudimentary like always, but that's not what I'm writing this for. Add the pal pad to the trainer menu please. It was an item that the games had to keep a list of your friends. I think that would be a great addition. Have your friends from around the world registered via usernames something to keep an eye on their level up and medals and even pokedex progress. It would be a nice addition I feel the game misses as an often times multiplayer game. I.e. raids and community events",
        "I enjoy the game play and weather mechanics and new gyms quite a bit raids are also awesome great idea. I think what would bring alot of original players back is trading pokemon. Then later down the road pvp battles. I hope you take my reveiw into consideration Niantic Inc. From one person who grew up with pokemon these would be great features for the game.",
        "It runs quite smooth and gives me an extra reason to get out and exercise. My only beaf now is that it is impossible to acquire any of the legendaries. If you live in a small rural town you will never have the numbers to take on anything beyond 3 star in raids. Everything else is awesome though.",
        "I am currently on vacation and this app has given me more points of interest than using Google Maps alone!!  Every single pokestop is something interesting...  I don't know why I didn't think to use it for this sooner.  I've seen more in this city today than I have the 3 days I've been here!"

        "Homescapes is an awesome game, combining the relaxation (and frustration!) of match 3 games with the joy of renovating a fabulous mansion. Throw in the fascinating story line, lovable characters lovely music and stunning graphics (except the kitchen wallpaper lol), I'll be playing this for a long time! I'm working on the living room right now, getting close to level 800! Thank you Playrix!",
        "Its a mind blowing game i cant help but to play this game my day seems not complete if i cant play the game specially when i cant pass the next level and the hardest part is the hard level the time are very fast when i am playing.i really love it and the freebies i can get everyday to boost my game.thank you creators and the makers the graphics and the animation is very realistic.",
        "This is really exciting BUT the levels get way too hard!!! I want a game that you don't have to replay a level more than a couple times! That's when I stop playing. It's a game...it's supposed to be fun not rocket science!! It should relax you but when you're played a level 6 or 7 times and you get down to needing1move to win... yet again... you get stressed!! And the levels should be concentrated on tasks to fix the house not on things like starting a new day or talking to someone to fix something! PLEASE fix these things so it's fun! I like a challenge but this is ridiculous!!!",
        "Just gave it 2 stars from 3 stars, everytime i use the kite booster it doesn't work and wastes it by flying away. Continued is my previous feedback. Love the game but it is ridiculous how we need stars to start a new day etc. It is difficult to get stars anyway. The lives go out fast because levels are hard. It take 900 coins just for 5 extra turns to finish the level but you get 45 or 50 coins only per level. You need to change this. Make it on the same level, give us atleast 1000 coins per level and let the level have enough stars per task rather than 1 star per level and requirement is 2 stars per task. Something to look into.",
        "Game is awesome... sometimes it takes days to get past one level which is dumb.... wish I could move ahead in the game faster... would make it more enjoyable.",
        "Getting green pieces gets extremely redundant. After 30 levels it's still the goal. Levels are near impossible unless you get lucky and things line up perfectly."

        "This game is great and could be better if it was fair for everyone that plays! If you are a free to play player you will be destroyed with no way of getting ahead in this game. IGG only wants pay to play players with the upgrades and fixes they have put in this game. The game is fun and would have more people keep playing but once you play for a while and see it takes an ungodly amount of time to do anything in this game people quit. IGG really needs to look at this an make the game more enjoyable for all!",
        "Love this game some people p2p but you dont have to. To level up does not take long and its easy step by step. Also if you you run into events you are not sure of how to do most pros help out . I also love the fact you can send items you need to other like food.",
        "This is a pretty fun game as long as you don't care that IGG doesn't care. I've enjoyed the people I've met (And they're really the only reason I keep playing).  Unless you spend an ungodly amount of money it takes forever to be able to participate with the big guys (and theres ALOT of them. ) Plus there are many glitches that IGG won't ever own up to or reimburse you for. Itsnlike a vending machine play, and pay money at your own risk cuz if you lose, man you REALLY lose.",
        "I thought this games was amazing. Spent a ton of money and it was fun. Then one night, after putting up a 24 hour shield, I was zeroed. Requested IGG look into it and requested reimbursement. Unfortunate that their glitches cause so many issues. They have so many glitches that they cannot find any abnormalities in my 24 hour shield dropping after 6 hours...  will not spend another dime on this game, and I do not believe anyone else should either",
        "This game needs balance. Seems like all one does is hide behind shields and gather resources and hope higher might players harvest you for your resources. There should be a limit on how weak a higher might player can attack. An individual with over 100 million might should not be attacking someone with only 10 or 20 million. This game isnt a war game, its all about hiding behind a shield and being a resource collection for pay to win players",
        "Pretty good. 4 stars because I never liked the time it takes to do stuff. I know it is profit making, but I gave 4 stars because it is manageable and they do have lots of free instant completes. This is waaaaaaaaaaay better than clash of clans... JS."

        "Bright, colorful, addictive game play. Adorably happy graphics. Love \"Mr. Encouragement\", who exclaims \"sweet!\", & \"delicious!\" in his baritone voice. The music isn't my favorite, I find it somewhat creepy. Greatful for the music mute button.  Thank you Development Crew for a fantastic, free app which I have been playing for years! One suggestion: make it clear $3 gets you one-time access to your piggy bank only. Thanks😄",
        "good way to teach us to be patient should we prefer to play freely.   Occasionally error.  KING, to make this game more enjoyable, .wld you pls kindly give us PIGGY BANK freely so we can still collect and use our gold? .pls give brief explanation on new things we're abt to encounter, e.g: HOW TO PLAY, the use of NEW THINGS.  thanks KING, jia you",
        "I just completed all 3185 rounds... took nearly 2 years to do so. A couple of suggestions...  1. Some big reward must be given to the one who completes all the rounds... an uphill task. 2. All these years I played the spin wheel every day ... but not even once the jackpot was opened... it simply shows the malintentions of the programmers who programmed it as such. 3. Boosters must be given more often.",
        "entertains well. but plz try to improve the swiping feature ncz when we want to play the first or second episode ,have to swipe all over down n got fed up with that, its taking too much time to do so. its really urgent to improve that thing.",
        "I love this game but level 3166 is impossible! Once you take out one licorice another drops....you need to rethink that level, because it's a level that will make people stop playing.... doesn't matter what boosters you use the licorice keeps dropping and you can NEVER clear all the jelly!",
        "Very disappointed in this app over the last several months.  Every time I go into app to play game I get kicked out.  It is not always immediate which is very frustrating because I will loose lives etc UN-necessarily."

        "One way to check how much products I have left is by touching the machine and thr corresponding product but sometimes the game will assume  that you are putting the product into production hence it will put the product into production whether you want it or not so it will waste production time. Sometimes the touch is too sensitive. Sometimes the touch is not sensitive enough which forces me to drag the product into the production slot up to 10 ten times just to start production. I know this feedback is not much but maybe an undo button will help. It makes the gameplay million times difference if you  put your players comfort a priority.",
        "Long time player returning to the game after taking a break. I leveled up to level 41 today. Before leveling up it showed I should get 1 white and 1 black rabbit with the new level but I didn't get either of them. I would also like to see it a bit easier to get wildlife refuge animals. 36 puzzle pieces seems a bit much.",
        "They keep taking my diamonds and telling me I spent them somewhere. Like I spent 19 on fast tracking 1 Coco tree while I have Tom for 6 days and 102 Coco's in my silo then tell me they can't refund it because I'm a liar! They took 50 from my husband and only refunded him 30!! Super cell is ripping players off!!",
        "I absolutely adore this app for it's witty, adorable characters and simple yet infinite concepts. I'm addicted! I have one issue, though. The limits on the barn and silo, frankly suck. I have eleven duct tapes but no screws so I had to pay diamonds I didn't want to spend so I could have a little flexiblility! Please fix this.",
        "I buy an axe it will last forever same thing with other tools but here I have to keep buying tools to do the job. An if I need more crop I get the land ready for more seeding get the water. This you have to bring in more people that never show up to do the work. That's why if I'm going to farm I count on one person me. Here you need others. It not for me.",
        "Love this game. My mom and I play it 24/7. It's addicting. Annnd it's a great time killer. Just like everyone else there are things that I would suggest to improve the game. Like for example the time frame for waiting on items. Crazyyyy long. Like the fish nets are like 14hrs! Could drop all the high times to half. That would be cool. But of course if you guys did that then it would be super easy to level up. And you guys would loose out on money cause there are some impatience people out there that just go ahead and buy diamonds and such. Anywho. Love the game. Please consider some of these people's suggestions. Thank you. #HayDayFan"

I was up to 2 hour on the fish, multi color candy, and the juicy jawbreaker, with 3 hours of life. Suddenly,  i still had the life but all other rewards disappeared. This is far from the first time. I am tired of it. I am removing the king games and I am not coming back this time. I get glitches happen but I have never had any  Indication  that anyone gives a damn. No one makes anything right or even says,  sorry. I'm ok with a game having issues but I am not ok with being treated less than.",
        "In places with bad connection the facebook popup bug is also annoying and causes you to have to restart, losing lives and the streak. And having to click different buttons to confirm to end a game is stupid design.",
        "Would love to give a better rating, but after the most recent update the game has very bad lag, worse than the usual lag it's always had. Updating this. Was hoping update today would fix the lag. It didn't. Also, adding 2 extra steps in order to replay a stage sucks. You know the old saying; if it ain't broke, don't fix it.",
        "EDIT: Update on 3/22/18 fixed NOTHING! New levels still locked as well! Worst update in candy crush history. Riddled with bugs. It didn't add new levels like it should have. Unlimited boosters don't appear on level when they should. And boosters are no longer allowed on lower levels. I'm at level 2100 something. I should be able to use boosters when ever I want! And I should be able to have unlimited boosters appear on all levels, not just when they feel like it. Fix and I will give more stars."

        "I like it.   The fish are friendly and encouraging.  I use the game to help me keep calm and relax.  Please consider allowing us to select another of one of the earlier aquariums when we get to the point where we are waiting for new aquariums to be developed and have finished everything.  I'd like a place to put new fish and decorations, but none of the old fish want to be sold.  They are still my favorite friends.  The game uses a lot of memory, and I had to uninstall it from my tablet because it kept making it crash.  Works on my phone, but it's still a lot of memory.",
        "Love this game!! I love the challenge with completing levels. There's days I can't get enough of this game. I play every day. I love decorating my tanks. I love when I get infinite time, but It would be nice if we had control over when to use it or the time would stop and be saved for when we return. Sometimes 6 hours is impossible to sit there and just play. One thing that would be nice is if we didn't have to wait 30 mins for a life to renew and could have more friends to  receive more lives and got to use the diamonds we earned amd not be stored in a bank to buy. Other than that I cant complain😉 best game out there and I highly recommend it to all ages.",
        "It's a great game. I play it with my daughter on our freetime it's quite addictive. Its great that you get rewards if you have to watch the movies. The only thing i would change is the reloding of the lives. Half an hour for one life is too long. Every so often you get a few free hours, but you need to have free time to play.I love the fact that we can play using my phone sideways (landscape ) as I have a problem with my wrist. I highly recommend it!",
        "Fishdom is a fun game.  The puzzles are challenging. I would love to see a change to the gifts we can give our neighbors . Such as, the lightening, or fireworks, or an ornament for their aquarium. I would also like to see the diamonds we earn to be available, not stuck in a bank, to be paid for.  Limits could be put on it, of course, but the free one here and there only help once in any puzzle sequence.   Overall, though, its a nice game.",
        "I love this game I just wish it was more interactive with the fish in one's tank. Like when you pet them little hearts appear and one can earn happiness points with so many touches. I also wish that one could still earn something for previous tanks. I have no real reason to visit my first and second tank. I don't earn anything for more decorations and it doesn't get dirty and the fish don't get hungry. I feel bad for them, but I focus on my current tanks.",
        "Got a new tablet for Xmas.   Had game on sd card. Wouldn't transfer to new tablet.  Was on level 105.  Have to start all over again! TORTURE lol. Other games I would just stop but not this one.  I love It!  EDIT...STILL LOVE THIS GAME.  Highly reccommend it!  Some levels are SO difficult but still loving this game Oct 9/17.  DEC 2017.  Still adore this game.  Now my husband plays too.  Best game EVER!"

        "This WAS my favorite game and was happy to spend a small amount of money to make my team competitive. If you are a new player DON'T download this game unless you plan to spend thousands of real money you are too far behind to compete. It now takes about 15 million in game currency to max out a character with all it needs. you will only make about 8 million a week if you complete every task and join a good team. So basically 2 weeks per character and you need a minimum of 5 maxed characters to make a dent",
        "So it's kinda fun but I'm rating it low based on the cost of purchasing character shards versus how many you get. I tested it out and purchased a ton of purple diamond things and purchased character shards that gives between 5 and 330. Out of 7 purchases at 1299 each, I got a total of 41 shards. So for roughly 9100 diamonds, I get 41 shards. You do the math. This game apparently enjoys taking your money. I've mentioned this to the developers with no reply. DC Legends knows what they're doing when it comes to purchases of character shards. At least they make it easier",
        "Very addictive. I started playing casually, and 4 weeks later I find myself checking it all the time. It's best played with at least a minor investment, but reasonably ftp...if you got patience.  Add: it's been six months, and I'm still hammering away at it. It has a huge base of fans,and I've only needed customer support once (and they handled my issue very well and quickly).  Still a bit grind-y, but great little bit of clicky gaming.",
        "This game hooked me up. The community it is very helpfull and growing evryday.Check youtube videos befor you start playing this game because is a griding game and you will need patiance and a good guidance at the start. It is not p2w you can play it as a f2p but you will need patiance so dont worry about money...in this game money will only save you time not exclusive content. 5* from me this is for sure the best mobile game ever. May the force be with you.",
        "I Personally would like to have the ability to upgrade stars on heroes easier without spending real money. Get 2 to 3 stars on the characters for free leaves me wanting, and im just not spending money on a game like this. Otherwise it is a fun game. Even though it basically can be a full time job you dont make money on and have to spend money on. So if you dont mind commiting months to barely make it to do the late game stuff amd still have to spend months to progress. This game will be great. This review is for those who play ftp games without actually paying to win.",
        "The game is fun enough but to sync it with your Google account to have to give your phone and all its abilities to EA. Why is there a need for the game to access my photos and make and answer calls? How 'bout I play a game on my phone with cool light sabers and fun music and when I need to make a call I'll stop for a bit. Just let people play and EA can make bank with their microtransactions. GTFO of people's personal info."

Can this problem be solved or should I deinstall all king games I have? I have no problem with games from other developers, so this is on you, not on me.",
        "Have played this game virtually since it first started it's a great game but why do we haveto buy the gold bars we have earned throughout the games I have never spent a cent buying anything! Shouldn't most of the gold bars be awarded to us for being loyal gamers ☺",
        "At level 558 I quit this game like 2=3 years ago... Now I don't even remember how to defeat spiders etc... Thought it would be fun to start over from scratch... But of course in these games not even a chance...  Great fun... NO",
        "I enjoy the game BUT.... I payed £2.99 to open the piggy bank to collect my gold bars and when I tried to collect them again, I have a pop up telling me that I have to pay another £2.99 AGAIN to collect the 50 gold bars I have earned from completing each level! Nothing states that these are one off payments and that you have to pay everytime you want to collect your 50 gold bars. I never normally spend money on games and I most certainly will not waste any money on this game again! What an absolute rip off. When a gamer clicks on the piggy bank, I think that the notification should state that you have to pay the ridiculous amount of £2.99 everytime you want to collect your 50 gold bars.",
        "Latest update keeps crashing especially when a level has been won and on the bonus. Crashes to hone screen then the level is lost  and had to be done again. Will restore 5 stars when fixed.",
        "Payments for bricks does not respond with google play . Just says error occurred try later or wrong password. Im already logged in google play atc. I did not make any changes in my account."

Game play is fun, there aren't ads every 30 seconds, the app runs smooth, and the artistry that went into designing this game and the characters in it is absolutely flawless. Can't complain at all. Great game, I do recommend to anyone who likes puzzle and strategy games.  10/10!",
        "Awesome game. Sadly motivated by profit grabbing providers. The cost to buy extra lives is astronomical. The only way to buy on a more viable basis was via the piggybank and guess what. They removed it. When I questioned this I got standard fob off bull. I questioned that and guess what no reply. A shame, it is a great addictive game. Just don't get tempted to get you wallet out..........",
        "Zainy!  I can understand the addictivity of it, however, just as I was getting into each level, surprise!, is was completed! This spoilt a bit of the fun for me.  The catchy music, oddly I never got tired of hearing... Great game!!!  This review is after my first experience of the game which I played upto level 20 before stopping.",
        "Sounds boring but I'm loving it! Sucks you right in. Starting to get a little complex (actually using some real brain power) but still very much doable and no charges as of yet and I'm up to level 10 atm. I am no gamer by any means but I'm really enjoying this.",
        "Awesome game! Thanks to the developers for not only making this fun, but doing it in a dignified way (i.e., no annoying ads). I love this game! It's fun, addictive, and challenging enough that it's still entertaining 500 levels in! Love it, can't say enough good things about it.",
        "I love this game as it's challenging but not ridiculously hard! Very addictive & u can get coins & power ups within the game, 2 help u, so there's no need 2 buy any! 🤗 Pity more games aren't like that!! 😊"

They give daily prizesand makes thou wsnt to come back. It can be frustratingly challenging and that is a hood thing.. thank you creators.",
        "Ok new review, I've passed all 1740 levels would have given 5 stars but the upper levels can only be passed when you hit the right program! Play same level 20-30+ times then suddenly pass with 10-15 moves left!!! Not fun anymore!!! Uninstalled",
        "This game was my favorite, however the lack of being able to reset the game is truly sad 😢 and takes away from my joy of the game! Please give the option for us to reset our play easily, please 💕",
        "Can you sponsor a video for me? I've introduced this game to several people and I have yet to hear it be exposed on youtube. As a creator I can give the game the exposure it deserves.",
        "The recent changes to the game bother me, you can no longer see how many points you get as you go or when you fail. Now it seems that they limit the amount of points you can get at the end for the moves you have left. The only time you see points is the total at the very end. Seems like they're screwing the people who want to get 3 stars on the levels...",
        "I enjoyed playing this game but I was to reset game to beginning.Tried clearing data and cache but didn't work.E-mailed developers to ask them and they e-mailed back saying they would but only once which I am still waiting for them to do.What is the big deal about wanting to start over the game again?Better that than once getting to levels you can't do to not play game again surely!!!!"

It's pretty simple and easy to learn. Newer and f2p players have a bit of a rough go, but you can easily keep pace in this game for less than $100 a year.",
        "It's a fun game for a while before you will get frustating. Too much depending on luck no matter how good your deck is if you couldnt get the card to do your combo its useless againt an opponant that have better draw than you.  Also if you are free to play you have to be petient to get ass kick for a while till you have luck enough to get some useful legend card.",
        "I love card games and this got some awesome elements. However... The randomness and luck in this game is pure bs. You can be in a winning position and still lose because of 1 in a 10000000 chance of the oponent getting lucky. Even when I win I feel bad from winning because I know the oponet was unlucky.... It is very rare I get a game where I think. This game was awesome because we both did our best.",
        "I never even got to play. I have now tried to install 3x. The first two times the app became unresponsive. The third it caused my phone to crash and reboot.

        "Great game! Love all the really cool animations! I do have a problem that since I installed the game, my store has been closed 😐 I am installing it on PC right now to see if I can get to the store there. Game play is awesome though!",
        "Really fun game. 3 stars cause it closes very easily. If I get a phone call even when I dont answer the game closes.even on wifi it closes. Then it takes too long to reload causing me to lose a turn. This is the worst in arena because losing one turn will kill you and it becomes a waste of gold. Please do whatever you can to solve this problem."

        "I enjoy this game a lot for their variety of games. I will say the starting bonus is very generous. The clubs are fun if you find a good one to be a part of. My only issue is the payout system... It seems when you make a decent win, your chances of winning anything are greatly reduced for a period of time,on any game or slots. No jackpot yet. The ads are not bad.. At all. I won't give up.. And I'm not the only one who notices the payout system.. I won't put my own money into this game just yet.. And if I run out I'll uninstall. But definitely give this one a try if ur looking for a good Casino Game.",
        "This game is very well choreographed. I like the theme music it plays . I like the fact that it give lots of hi winnings. The backgrounds are nicely colored. Very  adictive games. My favorite\"ZEUS SLOTS\". Not fair, I'm not getting some of my winnings. I will take off a star for that. But I still love this game. Although I have been playing this game for a while, and it has improved alot. Now my favorite games are HERCULES, THE MUMMY, and the DIAMONDS SLOTS, and the FRUIT SLOTS. Now I LOVE this game. Some of the game slots needs to up beat the music. Some games are slow, sleepy music. I have always loved this game. Its a lot of fun. It keeps me motivated. My newest favorite game yet is\" WILD STARS\"  . However, \"ZEUS\" I feel that it need to update its amount of pay. And add different characters and music. Love the action😄. This is always an exciting game.😉Ah, always an awesome game.😆This is a wonderful game to play when your on vacation. Just awesome. I love this game, exciting wins. This will always be my favorite game.",
        "Warning careful with this game!  It's ok....hard to win anything. I 've spent quite a bit of money in this game. In the last week ALOT!!!! Both my Husband and I play I explained I could no longer seem to win anything . My Husband played on my device and his own, same room same exact bet. He spent a big sum, my device lost he could not win anything at all but he win 6 billion on his device. We had club members play exact game we was exact same bet, they won big my device won NOTHING AT all. Seems odd. Be Very Careful with this game. I do not believe something is right. After spending a VERY VERY LARGE SUM you would think a person could win a good sized jackpot. NOPE. I will not buy anymore.",
        "Enjoyable game, lots of freebies.  I now need to change up my review.i had made a purchase in the game during a \"Spin and Win\" promotion, that purchase stated that I would receive 10m chips for every 2k league points, at end of promotion, I did not receive any of my chips as promised per promotion advertising. I followed the process of getting in touch with Huuuge Casino and was told once that someone would be in touch with me, as of this listing I still have not heard back from anyone.",
        "So i liked the game enough to over look the constant in app purchase ads and advertisments that are timed perfectly to get you to accidently tap them. But what just made me uninstall this game was this: Twice now i have hit raise or bet in texas hold em' and instead the game folds my very obvious winning hand. Whether it is a technical issue or not, i dont care. There are better games out there that dont have this issue, and i suggest you play those instead of this one.  Phone Specs: Galaxy S7, fully updated OS, apps, etc., Verizon service provider.",
        "I have always been a loyal player at huuuge casino and can safely conclude I will continue for a long long long time. Why I said this? Simple - huuuge casino has such a wide varieties of games to satify all sorts of players. Huuuge from my experience not only practise fair play policy but also quite generous in giving free chips.  My plea to the great support team - please do the needfull to bring back Merlin Casino, Melbourne Casino and Singapore Casino. Texas hold'em held there were really superb and loved by many players. I don't understand why they vanished after maintenance works were completed.  My many thanks to the support team - you guys are good! Keep up the good work and CHEERS to all of you."

        "The game sets a new high standard in bland average. THE DEAL ISN'T TRUE TO LIFE, IN ALMOST EVERY SINGLE HAND DEALT (in tournaments) THERE IS MULTIPLE ACES & PICTURE CARDS. However for a poker fan that doesn't know this game it's worth the gamble lol. The game play is good, poor player avatar customisation options as it's simply a small selection of picture options with zero options for using one's social media profile pic. This means frequently there are multiple players with the same profile pic. It struggles a bit as a social game of cards because conversation is limited by time, you can sit at slower tables allowing for better chat but not in tournaments. It has nothing to stand it out & above other poker game apps for either negative or positive reasons. If you just want to play a game of poker with random people from around the planet though it won't disappoint. It does give the option to buy top up chips and a daily option to get chips for free from both in game buddies and a poker machine. From the entertainment point of view it ticks all the right boxes but it's not the best poker game on Google's app store. If it was food you'd spit it out because it's bland, not sweet nor spicy but porridge without sugar or sweeteners.",

That means you can progress through it without even spending a dime. Its a simple game with decent graphics to play at leisure and has become my current pass time.  Update 3/22/18  I decreased my rating to three stars (from 5) until the developer can correct the latest flop from most recent update. Flop regards being able to log in but paralyzed from any action that requires an in game pop up. I including the \"Help\" module which is used to contact dev with. If no improvement after a week, I will delete game and draw stars to 0.",

The game is starting to suffer because of bad customer service. Reduced my rating to 1 star until they get their act together.

I love that there are a few things to help but to have to put so much money into it to be able to do that really makes me not want to play, only a week of that but we get attacked so much that it was all for nothing. I must say Alot of people won't stay if this continues and you won't make as much if you contantly let people down on these little things you could fix. Makes us feel like it's only about the money... it should be fun and enjoyable but that's hard when everything takes so much and so long.... Make the money worth spending.",
        "This game has been glitching for the past 20 hours. can't log in. have reinstalled multiple tjmes. my army will probably have been wiped out by someone who has spent 120,000 dollars on his account (yes there are people who have spent that amount and that's what you're up against) glitch laden game. admins don't give a damn. I will get a standard response to this... if any. Don't download. don't play. don't waste your time and money.",
        "It's a good game but the issue is that much higher level players can attack you regularly. And this sets you back on your development. Level 5 players should not be being attacked by level 20 players. You rebuild an army using resources needed to grow only to have a higher level player destroy it again and again before you can even rebuild completely. My army took a day to rebuild and before I could yluse it it was destroyed again. And more resources are wasted. It is a distressing pattern that has put me off the game.",

But I currently now facing a problem whereby I can't upload my picture profile. It sucks. Help me and you get ur five stars rating. Get back to me asap. I've been trying for abt a month and nothing change",

Up until now every so called \"strategy game\" has been full of nothing but disappointment but then I came across king of Avalon and I was astonished that such a game existed.

        "You will have my 5stars back if you just remove that K.E. in the gold event!!! Or maybe just make it 1 day only!!!  It sucks that all my troops were killed because of that. At least maybe if someone attack a city, not all troops should be lose half of them maybe. How can i gather  resources to heal them if only few left and takes millions or thousands resources to use for healing. Un installed!!! It sucks really!!!"

        "WARNING: IF YOU DO NOT CORRECTLY SELECT POWERS BEFORE APPROVING, YOU LOSE THE POWER(S) YOU SHOULD HAVE RECEIVED! ALSO, DO NOT USE YOUR CRYSTAL SKULLS TO POWER UP, USE THEM TO EVOLVE! If you like One Piece, you'll like this game. The One Piece story line is faithfully adapted to the plot of the game (not exact, but great for a game story line). The characters are great. If you are patient and power up your characters, you don't have to pay to play. Basically no advertisement,  except for self promotion of the game.",
        "Whether you are a fan of One Piece of not, this is an awesome game. Lots of fun, great and faithful art, and a rich combat. Best of all, they practically cram gems down your throat so you never feel forced to actually have to buy any.  An update to this is that I have been playing this game for years, so it is nice to see them keeping it fresh and fun. Still love this game. And as always, anni is the planni for my fellow Redditors.",
        "This game is so fun collecting all the characters and trying to evolve them. Over the years I've had multiple phones so the only downside is the saving of data I wish it would just be connected to your account like most other games in case you lose or break your phone. Rather than having to start over is they can fix that issue this game is one of the best on the app store.",
        "I have always loved onepeice and liked brave frontier very much so it's the best of both world's if you have ever beenm waiting for a one piece rpg then this is it. And grinding for items could of not been anymore fun than this. Still having fun with this game. And it's still getting better and better. Thank you for a perfect one-piece game. Also I normally hate grinding for items but when you live one piece like I do then it's doesn't matter. They also update the game with new content making it even better. 2018 and the game is still going strong.",
        "Good for a One Piece fan! The many aspects of the game makes it interesting. There can be a bit of a learning curve for new players, but the slight challenge is what makes it fun. The updates and changes keep the game from becoming dull as well. Btw I have fun playing even as a free player because they are pretty generous with the game currency. You just need patience as with any game you play for free.",
        "Game is fun overall. But get ready to grind after a week or so. Gems comes pretty easy overtime. But the prize in the store is a bit pricy especially when you are never guarantee the characters you want in the draw. So if you are not in a hurry. Save up your gems until they have a event with a guarantee 10th draw or something that has a character you want. Other than that, this game is great time killer and I love playing this game while waiting on the animation renew."

        "Nice game with very good events but the drop rates to heroes of 5 star is too low i killed a lot of gems and scrols and hero orbs and my first 5 star i  dropped it at lvl 75. Okok now again event of summoning 100 scrolls and i continue still no 5 star hero only 4, just try and fix the drop rate. In the rest its a nice game.",
        "There is certainly alot to do, but is there really much to DO do? I've just been continually tapping red dots and getting free prizes, which (although nice) doesn't feel like I'm especially earning anything, you know?  Feels like a game that will keep you occupied for maybe months, but a year after you delete it will you really REMEMBER it? Probably not.",
        "It's a good time passer.  Beware of guild system, it has major flaws. If a guild leader doesn't log on in a while, The guild gets given to another.  When it happened to me it picked the newest, least trusted official, rather than the one who had been there since day 1 or one of the two who actually donate resources to the guild. So we easily lost months of work.",
        "I purchased the spring festival card on top of all the money I've already dumped into this game and the devs didn't give me my in game rewards. I've submitted numerous tickets to get a refund or my rewards and they just reply there is no problem. Ya no problem with you taking my money.  They deleted my review, wonder how many other people had this issue and had reviews deleted.",
        "Wasn't sure about this game at first. I love it. I use a f2p  and a vip one  to see  the difference  between the two. Really well done. Having said all that the game does require patience. This is an IDLE game. You pick it up do dailies, talk, spend money, or what ever you want to do in game, then put it down to \"farm gold,xp,mats\". The high end heros do take some planning to aquire as a f2p player. This game requires patience because it's an IDLE game. Yes some people have a ton of money to throw at the game but don't be jealous, just play your game and have fun.",
        "Not what I expected, given that my first impression of it was of IH being an \"annoying add\". Once I decided to pick it up though my thoughts changed rather drastically.   It's simple, it's fun and the warm colour palette of the graphics make a nice change compared to the widespread use of bleak colours in other games.   If you think you might enjoy this game, you sure are my friend."

        "I really love this game, i've been playing it for nerely 5 years now and although it can be hard to progress without paying money it is possible. I am free to play which can make it hard but for the people that are not willing to pay money igg is there for you, every week i can earn up to 1500 gems which is probably the reason i have yet to quit. Other than that the leveling and many heros makea the game that much better.",
        "Scam company that's only interested in taking your money. Events are rigged and if you ask them for probabilities or odds on winning a particular hero they fob you off with \"it's all random, and you need good luck\".....avoid spending any money on this app",
        "I up my rating to 4. After playing 5 years, this game is really fun to play. I cannot give 5 star as i still having issues with the gem price too crazy expensive. Hope igg can revise gem price back, so many player can support this game, not the rich guy only. I believe you guys has realise many p2p player already quit, so better to revise the germ price again. Overall, i love this game^^",
        "Absolutely love this game! Been playing forever, this game never gets boring. It's completely free, you just have to be patient and cautious with your materials. Amazing for a free to play app 😍😍",
        "I hate it. It's always connected to those fake link downloads ugh and if i donwload this game and run it for 30 seconds, the link will open BUT NO it's a lie. This game just wants to be seen as a game with millions of downloads and I HATE IT."

I loved it and played it all the time but then one day it suddenly stoped working when I was doing so well. I couldn't open the game anymore I tried many things and didn't work. I started a new game all from the beginning I had 55 cash in my town and all randomly it showed I had like 20. This game just wants you to keep making purchases. If you don't it will block you out.",
        "I love this game. I dont play a lot of games. Township just keeps getting better. Some things are a minor downfall to this game, like how you can usually get great items from the store, untill you need a product or item for a task or event item. Then unless you have the township cash to hire the dealer then its hard to get things done in time. Plus in order to complete some tasks, you have to sell everything in your barn to complete the task. You should be able to just harvest than sell without it subtracting it back from your task. But either than that its an awesome game...",
        "Something different and fun. I usually don't play these type games, but I love TOWNSHIP! Still having so much  fun with every level. AMAZING FUN! WOW! The HALLOWEEN decorations were so cute, I can't wait for Thanksgiving and Christmas. Loved the Cranberries. I'm enjoying Township more and more with each level. Year of the Rooster.  Greetings we're all gussied up for the holidays. It's Easter season 2018 still playing.",
        "Loved this game but I can't seem to get on the game now. I wait for a long time for it to start and have to sometimes uninstall and reinstall and wait for it to start again.  If It I do make it on I can't help other players by going to there town. I paid money on this game and play faithfully everyday. I'm feeling some kind of way about this. Please fix this.  Update: The bugs are fixed..Thank you",
        "It is fast pace and complex good for ny age,but it with it ads and constant up daes it is hard on your device. It can be played with out any cost, if one has the time and the patients. Other wise it can be costly.  If it a child playing it I would highly recommend supervision,not because of any other reason other than updates and complex issues.  But it is a thnking ame that is fun.",
        "This is one unique blend of many things made into a game that makes me feel obligated to keep coming back and keeping everything running in the game. It doesn't feel like this when I played HayDay. One highlight I have to mention, game cash (township cash) is generously given away in many form! No more worry of being unable to achieve this and that due to no cash available..."

        "Great potential, but there needs to be a way to earn free gems for the abundance of chest I have... Also there needs to be time to clean up the map once The main objective is completed and definently more chalice for chances to complete levels, I only have a certain amount of time to play so I need to fit it into my time, not yours.... Ok game but not a great game for the players, micro-transaction heavy and very little chances to complete the levels.",
        "Really enjoy the game. Relaxing and addicting. However, i dont like the large amounts of lock chests taking up my camp space. I think the lock chests are too much of a push to get me to buy crystals. Chances of getting crystals seem slim and with the small amount of space available for other things, this is a down side for me. If i have to pay to open chests that i have been rewarded, why play? That might be  something that causes me to quit the game before too long.",
        "When I first downloaded this game it was fun...now, all the dragons only have a stamina of 1 and now you need trophies to play levels. These trophies take f-o-r-e-v-e-r to accumulate. These things have made the game drag on way too long. And accomplishing any thing may also cost actual money now. I have read other reviews about the money system of this game and I will not be throwing my money down this drain.",
        "Loved this game at the start. But since last update it has crashed on me several times. Today alone it has crashed on me 3 times. I lost all my camp progress each time and had to start again and of course each time is different because it is impossible to duplicate. Today I also lost my dragon gems and dragons I had created prior to crashes. There fore I lost my money spent. I also lost my daily chest which  contained 2 life trees and a super egg fragment.  I am very upset and dissatisfied now and regret spending money on this game that I loved prior to all the crashes.",
        "Please remove The Challenges. The timer runs out too early on all of the challenges, all the way up to challenge 20. I have all the standard levels finished. I have been waiting for you to make new standard levels. The timer is cheating people in your challenges. There is no way they can be completed. I am not buying 50 gems to add 2 minutes. That's a waste of my money.",
        "The game is great but customer service is non- existent. I bought the 30 day gem special that was supposed to come with an egg and fountain. Got the gems (so far)but not the extra items. Tried contacting customer support several times but following their M.O., they never respond."

        "I started this game when it first came out. There were hardly any game advantages and everyone was having fun and on the same playing field. As more and more packages got released into the game it became a pay to win situation. I personally do not think spending $100+ on a phone game is a wise investment. Thus I enjoyed the game by taking advantage of their events and the prizes within the game. However, it has become dominated by people who payed to be the big guy and the little people get absolutely demolished. It has taken the fun out of playing, which really dissapoints me as it was a fun game to play.",
        "This game has potential to be fun but it's completely ruined because IT'S COMPLETELY PAY-TO-WIN which sucked the fun out of the game that I quit. Don't get me wrong, Final Fantasy is highly respected RPG franchise because it's full of great games in the series. But no this one.  However, I might come back if the game developers make it not as pay-to-win as it is now. Right now, it's a complete money bucket!",
        "This game is great and fun, I love spending my time playing this game. One problem though, what is going on with the packages? Why is it every time a package is bought all the packages go from 20 to 100 dollars ? We should be able to buy the 20 dollar packages more than once! Is that fixable? Please cuz i do want to keep playing but 100 dollars is too much.",
        "The game is very addictive and fun to play. Some of the people playing the game are wonderful and fun to game with. Graphics are very good for a on line game played on phone, tablet or computer. The quests are challenging at best. BUT!!! BE WARNED... This game is not for young children as there is explicit language and cut throat people playing the game. After all it is a war game and nothing more. Now down to the nitty-gritty of the game. Yes it's free, but that only get you so far before you will need to buy packs in the game to advance and unlock the two new characters. The game quests are designed for people to spend if you want to get ahead fast. Large amounts of  $$$$$$ Cash are needed to play this game. $$$$$$ Personal note, I know people who have spent thousands on this game. Over all the game is great for young adults on up. PG-15",
        "I absolutely LOVE my guild!!! Everyone is so cool,from all over the States & all over the world...have friends in other guilds as well from all over the world...my guild is like my \"family\"...some of us have even talked about meeting up with each other...I hope to finally meet some of my favorite people,especially our guild leader...we're like the best of friends!!! Although,he lives in TX & I'm from Michigan,we're both married ,but there's nothing I wouldn't do for him!!! Thanks so much for giving me this opportunity to meet such wonderful people!! Lifelong friends/family!!! 💜",
        "This game is great and will make you feel tho go all out. It challenges you in a healthy way and keeps you on your toes. Join a guild, trust me. You can do a lot by yourself but joining a guild in this game is actually fun. I haven't experienced anything toxic, yet. I've been playing for about a week and it's really great"

        "Excellent card game.  However as soon as you get passed reasonably priced starter packs you cannot play the game and why not?  Because you play two games then you need to spend huge amounts of money so you can play two more rounds.  Then you need good cards and guess what you have to buy them through a lottery system like gambling highly addictive but after maybe thousands of dollars you get the card you want guess what you need to evolve your card and guess what you need to buy your reagents big dough yet again.  Then when you have spent all your hard earned cash you need to buy special weapons to give yourself a good boost to your cards.  Do you get where this game and a right game it is too. It relies on you getting addicted so you spend all your time and resources on an endless quest for something you will never have uninstalled buy buy.",
        "Amazing game, honestly, top 3 mobile game I've ever played, found an amazing guild and it's loads of fun. No paywall is the crowning achievement in my opinion. One thing, cause I don't know where customer support is, I started a Path of Champion level, and  on the first wave the game crashed and when I logged back on I had no key and didn't have a chance to beat the level",
        "Definitely pay to win. When you scroll up or down it thinks you are clicking on something. Stamina is a nightmare as when you reach a high enough level that takes more xp to level up, you can't play for hours as it takes to long to recharge. Should make gems easier to get for non paying players so it is more fair. Other than that pretty good.",
        "Number one of the best games I have ever played on my phone. I'm watching ads for bonus experience when sacrificing my cards. And I love the fact of that availability. Especially since it pays them which increases chances of more games like this one. Keep up the great work. Really helping my cognitive development of pattern recognition",
        "Great games. Controls suck.  You want to scroll and click a card instead (i know how to swipe) turns are fast paced..sometimes too fast. And as a starter...some of the turn challenges seem a bit unrealistic with the characters provided. Almost like they want to have you spend money off rip. Good game overall....but some things should definitely need work.",
        "It's a lot other games of this type. I haven't been able to find a problem with it yet. Great graphics although the timer is a bit fast when you're looking up connections. If you had a button that the players would push when they couldn't find any more connections, that would be great!"

        "The game is okay, but the drop rates are so suckish. I have opened 10 premium hero crystals  but have not even got a 3 star. My friend, opened his 2nd premium crystal and got a 3 star! Kabam pls like cancel out 2 star heroes in premium hero crystals and like only 3 to 4 or 5 star heroes inside. Oh and u can like gurantee  a 3 star in the 1st premium hero crystal, and also not force people to buy the 2 star hero crystal.",
        "Ive been playing for a year an some change an my characters the 4 star champions only hav 20 of them an as i progress it gets intense but the game itself cuts back on rewsrds especially the daily grind for 4 star crystal shards. ALSO worth mentioning that a year of playing an i cannot reach max rank on 4 star. Dont mention the 5 star champions. It will take you prob 4 to 5 months of everyday grinding to fully rank a 5 star or even obtain a new one. All the steam aside.  A great game addicting to the  higher levels as you progress",
        "The game is very uncreative. Many of the characters have same moves even when they have different powers... I advice to increase some moves of the players which should be according to their powers otherwise good game.  And also the drop rate is bad, upto this point I have opened about 60 premium crystals and haven't got a single 3 star hero or higher.  .",
        "Pretty repetitive. swipe back, swipe forward, tap tap tap, hold, repeat. controls are rather monotone which I'll slighlty overlook because of the nature of the game but I see a lot of champions have the exact same moveset. also the drop rates are pretty bad. And on arenas, the opponents bcome a lot more powerful than my own. Other than that, good time killer",
        "If you want to invest a ridiculous amount of time to save shards you collect in game to supposedly increase your chances for too quality cards then get yourself either duplicates of what you already have or rubbish class characters in general. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME WITH THIS GAME!",
        "I am addicted to this game. this game is awesome. But the people working in kabam are not good. They have blocked me from sending any messages. First of all I thought it was due to some bugs then I wrote a complaint to kabam. Lately they replied that        I have violated the rules. But I didn't do anything. If I really did anything wrong then they have to send me the proof. with out any proof and information they blocked me. You guys blocked me fine now send me the proof. Prove me that you really know your job. My name in the game is snsnns211187. Send me the proof. With out any proof you should not block me."

        "Love this game addictive and lose time playing it. But anyone else having problems logging in? When i try to log in it just sits on the loading screen (on 100%).. Until i close the app and restart it Tried making a fresh Charecter and goes straight into other characters but just not my main.. This started happening an hour ago",
        "This game sucks.. I always get thee same armament with only one star!  and some items are soo expensive that the money you pay is not worthy for the br you get and in return you'll get low br and also low money not worthy.. If they make this game less expensive maybe I'll give it a four stars... But no! not this time",
        "I can't get certain menus to work. In shop its the purchase for mount gear, all i see is random text and it freezes the game. Some of the event menus do the same. Ive been playing for a little over a year and never had this problem. Please help.  Also the merit shop menu is broken. I can't buy anything and the event ends today. Ill update as I see other menus broken.",
        "Makes you pay good money to be strong then merges you with much older servers that allows a no pay player to be much stronger ... horrible customer service also! Edit 3\\18 I see Gatorcade replied to this saying contact them for help. I did 8 days ago with no reply... So yeah like I said horrible customer service",
        "I paid money on This game only for it to stop working once I did...plunder doesn't open for me, mounts won't open for me...assassins creed play won't open...if I do open them....game immediately freezes and I have to shut down. Funny how I pay money and now I have Chinese characters all over the damn game...  THIS is absolutely a pay to play game...except when you pay...the game apparently stops working....",
        "Hey guys.. So when I try to level up my mount I click on the icon and when it comes up most of it is blank except a few words in another language. It freezes the screen so I have to close out and sign back in. Also I can't get anything on plunder either. Some help would be greatly appreciated, thank you."

        "PLEASE  HELP!!!!! So i uninstalled and reinstalled the game in my phone but there is no prompt that ask me if i wanna continue my progress when i play it again and it seems that im link to my google play (bacause there is no option to link it in the settings) but i still start back from the very beginning. And didn't really recovered my previous game. Love everything except for this.  P.S. i did the troubleshooting in the forum but nothing really helps.",
        "So after about a week of gameplay there are some things that I think can be improved upon. I understand this is not the computer version so automated actions are probably not going to be included. I feel like when I'm done using a product such as getting married, I should be able to return those items and get at least half my money back. I noticed that when I'm deleting items I'm not getting anything back and then item is completely gone.   This review won't be all negative though. I really like how you can meet different people from different countries, and chat with them via parties. I think the ducky bucks function sucks. And while I can understand the effort that was made when creating all these different tickets, I think it's just too much",
        "I've always been a fan of The Sims since it first came out on the PC and now this version is WAY BETTER than their other App game! I LOVE IT! It's so much fun and I can't wait to see what more is in store! UPDATE: After playing longer and being able to have a baby with my spouse, I found that our kids are labeled son and daughter under his family tree, but as father and niece under mine. That makes no sense! What's going on?!",
        "One of the best mobile games I have played. Not forced to buy anything with real money to keep playing, the cupcakes are great, I love everything. Right now, this is funner than Sims 4! My only complaint is that you can't change the story with another sim. I would love if once a story is complete, you could choose to pick another one. After all, relationships change over time in real life. Love this game!",
        "Sims is finally here on Mobile! I like how the Sims can complete events while you're not in the App. My only concerns are the limitations. It seems like with a lot of the actions my Sim is talking to herself or interacting with herself especially during the Hot Tub events. It would be nice to have them be able to interact with other Sims even while at work or at another event especially if rust are already friends or lovers with the other Sims! Also I think the careers and hobbies should have more variety. I also would like to be able to purchase a pool and build a patio.",
        "Great Game! Really captures that what made SIMS fun and for mobile on the go at that! Graphics are reasonable considering it is new. When building houses the only drawback is you cant construct walls within a room, you have to work with box rooms. As well as you cant make like a out door patio without it being in a room enclosure.  All in all though I do highly recommend this game to you if youve enjoyed SIMS games in the past. Loads to do,events and updates to keep you busy for awhile."

        "This season I really put in a big effort to try and win the treble. Got the best players, do all the training, strategy ect. All for nothing. Lost against a crappy team in semi of Cup. Apparently according to IA it wasn't my day. Like I said before, game is pre programmed. Dev's do nothing about the gameplay, they rather concentrate on silly add ons which can make them money. Big boooooooooo for dev's.",
        "I think it is the BEST FOOTBALL MANAGING game i have ever played.  But you should make some changes,like as tikitaka,counter attack,long ball  ext. These will be helpful for us.we need more tactis. Thank yiu for your wonderful game.",
        "I am playing the game for 1year now and I think you have to increase the percentage of the players when they rest for 3hrs... I think 6% is not enough specially when we have 2 games per day (league and cup or champions league), because after the game, they still have to have two training sessions and they get too tired, with no time to recover at least 50 of condition for the next match, so from ther we have no manage well by leadind \"easy sesseions\" and player do not develop as they should. For me the time of recovery is fine, but the points conceived are to low... at least 10% in each 3hrs. Hope you get my point. The app is 👌 I love it",
        "In overall it's a good game but needs some changes.  The match engine is not so good .  Like promotion to next division , also should be a relegated team from that division to a lower division.  Prices are outstanding. Tokens are a problem.  But i insist AGAİN that SYSTEM DİVİSİON needs a new update or review. PUT AT LEAST A TEAM THAT SHOULD GET RELEGATED TO A LOWER DİVİSİON.  The idea that you have to change the whole team every season is also not a good thing. Some little changes are needed to make this game a wonderful game.",
        "Worst game ever every update just gives more problems and the current problems we message these idiots about are never resolved...infact they don't even reply.. they are only about the money now.. ive gave 6 years to these losers and this is how I am repaid.. disgusting is an understatement.. avoid games made by these rude ignoramuses at all costs",
        "I think u guys should find a way for us(we the managers) to get tokens easier . I don't understand why winning the league or champions league only gets you money but no tokens . it really sucks"

AND THEN WHEN THE NEW UPDATE COMES OUT.... I LOSE IT ALL!!!!!!!!!!!!! Can you PLEASE give me the stuff back.",
        "This is my favorite game.I have played it since I was in P1 but the only things that I want Rilisoft to make are a 4th campaign world cause I have been waiting for almost 4 years and that you can give your friends weapons.But still great and memorable game so well done Rilisoft",
        "I like this game a lot. I don't know if I were think too much but I feel like Everytime I level up, the weapon that I use before was unexpectedly weaker.Lucky chest seem to drop only coins and crysrals(sometimes I got free spin). And some modes, weapons and armor balance is not really that balance (example:last match I used smart bullet bazooka to kill people using 4 rockets to kill them. But he killed me with only 2 rockets of smart bullet bazooka...... How is that even balance?!). I hope you fix this soon. Because I love to play game.",

        "Wow! Just WOW! I had been very skeptical about downloading this huge gigabyte and pay-to-win game, BUT after finally \"trying it out to see\" I am now hooked and now a believer of all of the hype! I have gotten pretty far so far and have a pretty decent crew and I have not had to pay a red cent at all. The grinding in this game is actually fun and I do not mind watching an ad or two for fuel. Simple concept, EXCELLENT execution!",
        "Wow, I'm extremely impressed. The gameplay is very fluid (as it runs on a 60fps on my s9+) lagging and unrealism is unheard of. Also, the soundtrack throughout the games retains just as much excitement as you'll feel beginning the game, viewing car selecting and racing. A must have game for car/racing/gaming enthusiast's. Very additcting.",
        "Ok, my game is back but I'm missing a lamborghini 700-4 that was decked out completely with fusion parts maxed out and stage 6 nitrous and tires. So, you owe me a what, 4 start or 5 star car decked as my car was you took from me. I bought crates with money real money for that car. So I want the closest thing to my car the same as it was. Thank u",
        "I used to love this game. But now all it has become is an ATM for the developer. Every good car in the game must be bought. Winning special events costs money. In game rewards have become useless. There are plenty of other racing games out there that won't require you to refinance your house to play. If I could give it zero stars I would.",
        "Sound could use tweaking, I've driven some of the t1 and t2 cars and they do not sound like that. The grind is real in this game but the developer adds events on a frequent basis to over shadow this. Which would be great if the events didn't expect you to either have the devils luck with silver key crates or a never ending supply of cash.   Over all, great game. I still enjoy playing it even when I hit a \"pay wall\" and that says something about the game. I've only put $5 into this game (bought a $4.99 special pack) and I've still made it pretty far.",
        "Other than a gas glitch, I play this all the time. Takes some time to get the right parts for your cars. So if you can just race and collect money until you get a car with all 6 red parts, it's quick entertainment. You have to buy \"super nitrous\" to beat the leader in a race for his car...which sucks. There should be someway to get super nitrous in the game without buying with real money."

        "My first played MOBA. This is excellent game and there's nothing could beat this game. Otherwise, please make improvement like losing stars cause of that AFK player. Deducting credits may not the good way to discipline afk players. Its good if no one's lose or gain star either win or not. Make it the game not counted so players not waist time to pursue the game. I'll give 5 stars if 5 theres improvement. Thanks!",
        "MOBA with analog is really a big joke. The graphics is trashy. Hero and skin are hard to unlock. There's a kind of in game power up that could be bought with real money. The only reason this game has so many player is the game size & device compatibility. If your phone is capable of playing \"the famous 3v3 moba\", you'd better play that game",
        "This game is so cool. Only noob will say it hard to play or hard getting hero/skin. Maintain the gameplay and everything will be alright. Sometimes we win and sometime we won't. Only the graphics need to be improve. Come on! It's 2018 already! Make a tournament cause i wanna join!!. (Give me free skin. I give u  5 stars bitchhhhhhhh)",
        "Why don't you try real super hero characters that we know like from dc anime etc such as. Dragon ball naruto bleach justice league avengers try doing it new heroes are good but if there are some like worldwide famous heroes also then it would sound much more  interesting",
        "I love this game, I've been playing this for over a year and I still play it daily! All the skins and heroes skills are amazing. But please don't  let me team up with low level players it's affecting my game and stats when I'm trying my best to carry they would just afk which can be frustrating. But overall it's a good game",
        "I hv been playing this game for two years alll good perfect game perfect graphics..bt there should be some changes for the afk players... strict steps should be taken towards for these afk players not bye lowering credit score by banning from game for a period of time so that they won't be spoiling game any further"

I can't leave message with development so this is the best I can do about that. But I love the game and this wouldn't change my activity amount at all. Keep up the great work development and look forward to new games in the future.",
        "Best game i played ever. But new update have some bugs like if we going to play with friends it take too much time for loading nd mostly notification pop up that there is an error your coins refunded in your account. Kindly resolve this issue. Except this best game 👍",
        "So I have no idea why I am always at a club disadvantage. My driver is level 5 and always vs a person with level 7 or 8. Why do I never go against level 3 drivers. Always vs higher clubs! ALL THE TIME! you might as well give them the win. Losing me as a customer because there is something very lopsided.",
        "The mechanics of the game are fun, but once you move up a rank or two winning is tough. That is an issue because gold (needed to upgrade) is earned thru even payout bets and very little gold is generated naturally. If you can't keep a high win % you either can't play or need to spend $$$. It's hard to win often when most games come down to closest to the pin shootouts.",
        "Constantly glitching now. Will select an opponent but pictures continually scroll and game never starts. Have to shut game down and start back up for the game to begin. On the verge of uninstalling. Will select opponent and never start game and I end up losing money. Forever downloading, takes forever. I always loved 30 seconds when I start the game up if it doesn't start up by then I just shut it down. Beginning to be very disappointed"

Also PVP is very buggy as I am always seeing waiting for opponent or opponent is viewing last match which isn't an option. Just wondering if there is a security team that monitors online activity because it seems like a lot of people are manipulating the network at times.",
        "I like the game but last week 2 of my cards where removed I didn't accidentally delete them. They was locked. I emailed and got told that there was nothing they can do. It is a Titan pro Neville and a beast pro Tamina can someone help me get my cards back I played a lot of games to pro them right",
        "Horrible, disgusting excuse for customer service I have ever seen. Automated response no matter the issue. Never a problem ( and there are many many many issues.) Do not let the WWE license fool you, this is NOT a company I would support and I'm not sure why WWE can't find another company to produce a game.like this.",
        "They are still plagued by PVP issues that they claim they are fixing, but never do anything about. Not worth playing as you won't actually recieve your rewards for playing, and they won't help you if you send in a help ticket. You will only get form letter responses. WOULD NOT RECOMMEND."

        "Do not spend any money on this game. This used to be one of the best slot games until the developers got greedy. Payouts are small and events are nearly impossible. They try to make it all sound good but it's not. They also changed the customer service on here where it's hard to get anyone. You cannot message them on Facebook if you have a problem and if you say anything negative about the game you will be blocked. Hope this review saves some of you some time so you can find a better game!",
        "What the hell kind of question is that?  \"Is it beautiful\".... meaning the game! HOW NOT PERTAINING TO ANY GAMES!  Anyway,  this game is hands down the best Slot game EVER!  Have played slots in and out of casino's for over 20 years and this is the one to play! A huge variety of Casino games,  easy to maneuver and a lot of really nice people.",
        "I used to love this game but something they did changed it. Winning is nearly impossible even if you are a paying customer. I know it is a game of luck but when you purchase 85 silver tickets you should be able to complete puzzles when you only need 1 piece for each of them. Make winning a little easier and people will be happy to spend money.  I think the game is broken. I was just playing in a room on Billionaire with a person who was playing on Huge Casino. I know it's the same developer but I don't think that is supposed to happen. I know the person was playing Huge Casino because it was my husband playing it. May want to look into it.",
        "Customer relations are horrible even non existent. If you spend money you will lose far more than you win, in their eyes you will spend even more. If you send a message they will hide behind a canned \"industry standard\" response. This is not a free standing casino there are no freebies and you can't collect any winnings. Yet they have their games dialed in so you lose in hopes you will spend money. Horrible company.",
        "I just started this account in hopes of recovering my lost one. If it goes smoothly, I am happy with the app to date. The slots don't pay as much as they used to, a little tite , otherwise a fun app. The events they choose for you to play, daily, do steal a lot of chips. If u want to remain in a successful club, you must do them, is the main downfall. I would recommend it to my friends.",
        "This is an interesting game. After I played it for awhile it became very boring. Haven't gotten a big or any good win for the past 70 million. I guess if you buy chips you might win more often. It doesn't give you all the bonuses, and it takes gifts and doesn't give them to the gamers you gave it to. So all in all it's just okay. I've never been able to get anywhere with their support team as they added to my reply. I'd give it a one star but if you buy chips it might be better."

        "What have you done?!! This was a great game with a few annoying adverts, now it's just one long advert interspersed with occasional races. I have no real issue with adverts but when they stick on the screen and hide the X until way after the timer ends that's just offensive. And seriously - £8.99 PER MONTH to clear ads? (Yes I know you get extras) - come on that's taking the ****",
        "Really fun casual game. Adverts are present but not too intrusive. Allowed to watch adverts in exchange for upgrades or items.   My only criticism is that it takes a while to get used to the different menu items as there's no instructions and the \"see as far as you can go\" sections are really expensive to unlock.",
        "I've been crazy about this game, but the new update is terrible because of the crashes and bugs. In the middle of race my touch screen doesn't work, the pedals either. Please, for god sake,fix this annoying problem, i can't play any more.thanks a bunch",
        "Fix the damn gas pedal. The reason why I lose half my races cause the gas pedal just magical doesn't want to read my finger but the brake sure does work just fine. Keep shoving ads down my throat and it'll be all 1 star.",
        "Money greedy game. You will end up watching ads every minute. You will be forced to watch half a minute irrelevent ads every minute. It's like these guys built the best game to annoy people with ads. Good luck. Played several levels just to get annoyed and uninstall."

I don't know why this is happening but it sucks because it's putting me off the game.. it's like 8 ball is making sure I'm losing hence the rate 3",
        "Great 8 ball pool game. Plays great and looks great. 1 slight issue tho. Im from Ireland but i seem to be playing people from India and surrounding countries.   The Irish and Indian flag are kind of similar so im guessing thats where the issue is coming from.  I cant seem to edit my location either.  Would be great if someone could help but if not, ill be happy to continue playing against random beautiful Indian women 😁",

        "Hey miniclip.. good morning.. i am from india.. i was playing 8 ball pool dubai match. I was just about to win when i hit my solid ball and then last black ball was left but the ball goes in opponents hand said that you didn't hit your ball.. what was that? Can you please stop all these hacks and all for other users. There is no fair gameplay between each other.. please do some favourable to all users.  Hope you will take quick action in this manner Thanks.. Apoorv",
        "The game is very good. But that spin wheel is not fair at all. I've been playing this game for 6 years now (I know there used to be 1 coin reward there) and I've never got anything more than 2500 coin reward. My point is if you are keeping other rewards on that wheel atleast give equal probabilities for each reward. If not, just remove those big rewards and replace them with small ones but atleast with same probability for each of them. Hope you will do something. (P.S. i know it's a lucrative strategy developers play so that players will stick to the game. But you know just trying.✌️)",

And I was about to uninstall it..     2_one of the question was you can play with other users offline. This is not correct!...     3_ need to add \"Edit and changing names\"     4_Game rated with 5 star.. Than you all 🎱"

        "EA please keep improving, i already in love playing this game until i realized that i had to spend a lot amount of money to upgrade my team and collecting great cards.. actually im not feeling good at this because i'm not a rich guy that could paid all those packs with very high price.. im saying this to represent all f2p players out there, although im not so f2p at all. i only spent a dollar to buy that eoe pass and nothing again until now. so please, give a chance for f2p player to keep playing this game with no jealousy with those high overall p2p players.. thanks",
        "Be careful on this game, its possible to spend real money and get absolutely nothing in return! For example I bought a Saint Patrick pack, 1000 gems a pack and got 10 lucky leafs, I could use the lucky to buy another pack, which I got a lucky leafs from, so I spent 10 lucky leafs got 1 lucky leaf that I couldnt use  unless I brought more! Literally got nothing for my money. This is EAs way of mugging people.",
        "Please add more sounds effect on this game, and fix the sfx that already on this app. I hope you add full match online like the other game (90 minutes) so we just not attack but defends too. Replay button must be great, and i have idea that you guys add event like \"best goal of the week\" or so, from that replay, we can save, and send to you, and you can choose who will win it. I think it will make people playing this game. Commentator should be great too if you add full match versus online. I love this game, please read it. Egy Maulana V plays for Lechia Gdańsk now. Add it! Add to all of your fifa games. That replay button should be great",
        "I just saved up all my team hero points, watched a heap of ads so I could build up stamina so I could do my best to try to get Mané in team heroes. About half way through collecting my hero rewards, the rewards pages started to go blank, and the last 25 packs I opened were empty. Is there any way to correct this?",
        "The game is good but it could be better. Elite players are too expensive  so it's hard to upgrade team. Informs and special cards are all untradable so unless you get lucky in events you won't get a chance to play with them. The new layout is better though. Unless you have plenty of time or money don't expect to progress in this game all that quickly. Mobile games should not be as grindy as console games.",
        "What's wrong with this game. I was playing Vs mode and was in world class level and got more then 600000 fans.and now I saw I'm in pro level.how it could be automaticy.fix it pls what the hell is going on.i make my progress playing v hard and all gone with in movement.even I did not play and lose."

        "I was expecting this to come out soon, after all another build a medieval city clone. Nothing original about it. I play it only because of GOT theme. How to keep people playing? -Don't make the screen so congested. -Make stuff like buying a second builder permanent, not for 2 days.  -Basically don't make it P2W. If you don't get what I mean look up how EA messed up with Starwars Battlefront 2",
        "Alliances are complicated but use the chat feature and folk will tell you or PM you. It does take up a bit of time..IF YOU LET IT, but overall, not a bad game. Loads to do...follow what tyrion tells you. Wish I could find particular resources for crafting or I'm never gonna have a level 10 helmet haha. Have fun...don't let it rule your life",
        "Real truth! This game is built on your discourage to upgrade without buying. You can increase your castle but you have to spend real money all the time. Their rewards vs investment is 10% for you. You will spend your whole credit on this and still not be eligeable for the iron Throne. This is WB best scammed game out there! Things you 400 of to upgrade, only come as 6 units or less a month which pushes you to buy 100$ packages to upgrade. WB is laughting at you!",
        "12 days is an unacceptable amount of time to respond to a paying customer's problem. Is this the only way to get attention of WB? I have submitted ticket 5 times with no answer!",
        "Unless you completely have no life and plan to spend every waking second playing this i do not suggest it. I downloaded it to have to kill time but unless you spend plenty of money on it and are willing to dedicate majority of your day, you will probably be bullied and attacked by the ones who have no life and spend tons of money on it.",
        "Too expensive. The in-app purchases cost about 5-100 €. Those players who pay that on a regular basis dominate and win the game. Those players who don't are currently about 50 times smaller. It is like fighting off tanks and stealth bombers with flintstone and spears. You will lose."

        "There is an abusive player on battlefield 62 and the developers have not been very responsive.  If you want to play a game where a player repeatedly tells others to kill themselves, douse themselves in gasoline, threatens people, makes sexual assault jokes and literally tells players with cancer he hopes they lose their battle and just harrasses players to make them quit and even says that is what he is doing then this is the game for you.  Edit:The developers reply shows another issue with the game.  If they read the part where I said the developers have not been very responsive they would realize I did contact GM support about this issue.  They just have not done anything.  Nothing has been done even though multiple players have contacted them.  This is why they have 1 star review.",
        "Devs don't listen, battle fields are very imbalanced and half dead really. It's really a pay to play game so be prepared for that. It could be fun if they would pay more attention to players and not so concerned with how to make you pay for the next thing.",
        "Was really looking forward to playing this game and it does have potential, but it's so frustrating with bugs that makes it so disappointing. Sort the bugs out and you'd have a great game.",
        "It's a good game overall. The in game support is minimal to non existent. Your better off asking players for support. Its a good team building game. Like every other game like this it's pay to win but with strategy and a good team you can still have fun. Again it's a good game. I just hope they sell to a smarter company with better skills in game development and customer service (because without customers, you don't have a game) and then this would be an even better game. Give it a shot just get a good active team and don't expect help from customer service. Be careful buying packs and if you do screenshot EVERYTHING. Hope this helps",
        "If army men strike stuck to there rules, and didn't allow people making death threats, abusive language, to play, it would be better, I would not let anyone under 21 play this game as the explicit content in chat would lead to children learning much foul language and receiving death and rape threats.  Ask anyone in bf 62",
        "So many glitches to what could be a great game....slow on fixes....no lvl buffer so watch out for maxed out players who love hitting low players...be sure not to come to bf74 as it has been held hostage by a single player called Welpia and his corps ROK.....YOU WILL BE MISERABLE.....numerous unanswered complaints to customer support by numerous players....numerous players. May rage quit on this bf....attempts to get cs to act have failed....other wise a great game with great potential so long as you dont get stuck in a bf with one who calls himself Welpia or any corsps. Named ROK or Kor"

        "It's a good story and all. But I only wish they would let me save up energy or at least give me a little more. It gets frustrating when I can't Carry on, I'm not a patient person. Graphics are good. Controls are good. Story is great! Loving most of this game so far. I just hope they change the energy part of it. Though I guess it's a lot easier to read thn most episode stories.",
        "I love the story Line just like I've been reading in the comments the energy sucks I know it's just to keep us from reading the story so fast an to blow our money on, but if there was another way instead of us waiting for so long for just a little energy it's defently keeping me from downloading another game like this.. it takes so long to receive the 300 energy I done forgot an really not into the story Like I was when I 1st downloaded it.",
        "The story and art art great, like in the other game, and I love the music too.  I have 2 major complaints though: 1. It's not indicated anywhere in the appstore that this is a work in progress (there's currently 4 chapters in English). This particularly bothers me since I bought energy so I could get immersed in the story, only to be torn out of that immersion by an incomplete story. 2. The energy system. I mentioned this in my review for the Drogo one as well, and plenty of people pointed it out here so I won't go into detail.",
        "I think all of these Is it love stories are absolutely amazing. The writing has given me inspiration to read more romance novels. But I don't like the energy system. I foolishly paid a lot of money to read/play longer and I'm glad the author and developers get the money for a product I thoroughly enjoy. I just wish the daily energy was 1000 or something",
        "Amazing story... When will there be more chapters?! I also don't like how I have to buy energy in order to not just have five minutes (maybe) of reading the story and making decisions. Please come out with more chapters soon!",
        "Loving the story so far and the graphics.. It's all so beautiful. Only wish that they would give you more energy over time to read it.. when you lose time to read you lose interest in the story by the waiting. Help us stay interested!"

The AI will always take advantage of beating you with moves that will take what you need 98% of the time. Moves that no one can see but magically the AI knows what to choose to beat you. I love strategy games, but cheating is not a fun for anyone. The AI compition is not a compition. It's a slaghter waste of time until you get lucky or they give it too you. No strategy there. Just piss you off cheating AI. Being the top of Candy Crush and Candy crush soda. And yes also Jelly. It is ridiculous sometimes to waste my time with this one. If the AI opponents played at the highest level of what to use, then I wouldn't mind getting beaten. But when you watch the AI make the dumbest move to get what it needed, tells you that the AI sees the whole board. Even what is hidden. Give up or beat yourself up on this one. I seem to love the Gluten of punishment, lol.",

Watch the number counter not the monklings going under the rope & u will see the counter not go pass a certain number! THE SAME NUMBER continues like 6 will stay 6 4x's! That way u don't beat the level & u have to buy a booster, KING Co are CHEATS!",

        "Great addictive game! Starts out cute and innocent. Recently found out through a spoiler thread that it does take a darker turn in Ch 15. The U.S. servers are currently only on Ch 12. Still a great addicting game that many players start out thinking \"Awesome! A great game that I don't I can have the option to play for free!\" Soon they cave when that ONE outfit comes along that they HAVE TO HAVE lol.",
        "I love this game.I really do.It has brought me alot of joy. It's great fun and it's a guilty pleasure of mine. With that being said. Your Ranked Events are Not Excusable. I'm v7 so I have skin in the game as they say.. I will pass and when you stop your Ranked Events I will gladly change my review. No Excuse for a blantent cash grab you make a lot of money.",
        "I love this game! It's really good for creative people who like to design their own outfits. I just downloaded on my new phone and started over (I don't have Facebook to link my progress with). Please make it available to link with Google play so I don't always lose progress!   Also, since downloading again, I found that some of the names are different... I was very confused, since the voice over still says the old names. I like Yoko way better than Bobo!!",
        "I loved this game, and am V8. So its not like I am against paying. I am against the ranking event especially since you devs LIED TO YOUR PLAYERS and said we wont be getting one again. We will not pay 100s for a non guarenteed reward. It would be more HONEST, if you set up the suits as 300 USD each recharge.  If you are smart at all, devs you should understand that business ethics is just as important as profit and will benefit everyone in the long run.",
        "Lovely game! Gorgeous clothes and gameplay. A little cheesy in. The story but fairly creative for a dress up game. Plus it can be hilarious with how wild the lore gets around fashion. Design can be a little overcrowded sometimes but everything is coordinated so it still looks nice. Backgrounds are gorgeously painted. Tutorial is easy to understand but isnt too tedious. I am officially addicted",
        "I never write reviews, but this game deserves all the praise possible. Downloaded it for my niece and turns out I am the one addicted!! I'm a daily player now and love the fact that you can start your own group for 300 gems and approve applications and interact with your stylist association members. That aspect took the game to a whole new level. The clothing is beautiful and the attention to detail is great!!! Give it a shot and you just may become addicted like myself. I do spend around 20 bucks a week, but it was just as much fun before I was spending money, I just wanted the special clothes for events."

        "I really hated this game at first, when i was trying it on a friend's phone. It has really grown on me since then, i love it. I've been playing it for years now and still love it; the graphics are amazing, the game play is smooth, my clan is great, there's always new stuff to do or new bots/weapons to acquire. Yes, there are some people playing that kinda ruin a battle for your team but Hey, it's just a game and you still get points if you lose. Do your best and have fun.",
        "Great start! No glitches. Performs smoothly! One of the best games on Android!! Must download Belive me I have never spent a single penny of \"real\" money and the game has never been unfair to me. Its really very good game. They found a sweet spot to balance both paid and free players. You just need to go on playing. I got the costliest robot of the market for free. Keep playing you'll eventually be strong enough and then you'll never stop to play.",
        "After being so long on the game I can see that the development team behind this game is pretty committed. I can see they really put effort into debugging, improving and renewing some elements of the game, I've decided to increase the star counts for War Robots (This is the original one). It's one heck of a game for mobile device I can tell you that. As for attaining the \"best robots\" or the \"best weapons\" in the game, it's hard but it's not impossible.  Just take part in the festive events... and you don't neccessarily need the \"best bots\" to annihilate your opponents...",
        "This game is very much Pay to Win. So expect some people to crush you.  All the \"gambling\" games are fixed to make sure you get the lowest possible reward. Don't waste your gold gambling. All that said this game is worth 5 stars just for the gameplay. The graphics are amazing and the game is fun even when you end up against someone spending hundreds of real dollars on robots and gear. Be patient. You may not always win or do well but in time you can give all but the most hardcore spenders a run for their money (all pun intended)",
        "It will be cool if we can upgrade not  just one robot but all!! And pls double the gold I rlly need it right now for just 1 orkan And also why is it so hard to get a weapons like with puzzle logo on it it's like 10,000 can you imagine that! If I made the game I would do just 6,000 or 5,000! One more make a single player like player vs AI and it will say easy medium hard",
        "Fun for a little bit of time killing. I really enjoyed the gameplay and Graphics. However don't bother playing this game unless you are going to spend money on it. You quickly realize that everything you need to buy to upgrade your robot cost money or some other in-game currency that you have to spend money in order to get"

        "This game is pretty good and nintendo/IS takes in community feedback. This is probably one the most generous of any gacha game out right one and there have been some powerful units given to us for free. Content is 99% free to play friendly with only 1 or so events that were very difficult for f2p. While its not a true fire emblem game, it is still pretty good for a mobile game.  P.S. there are some 5 star units that shouldn't be there. They are only there to gimp you out of another unit.",
        "If you ever were interested in the Fire Emblem series then this is defenitely a good place to start off. It's simplistic enough for new players yet at the same time it offers a lot of possibilities on how to build your units. It's fun to collect Heroes in this game and it's fun working on them to make their stats and strategy better. Each Hero has a fun personality and each one of them is well drawn by talented artists.  A fun strategy game that also can get really challenging in some of the harder quests.",
        "Great game. I've never played Fire Emblem before, so this app is a great way to see what the games are like and all about. I like all of the cool characters and all the details each one has. If you like RPGs or want to try one out, this one may be a good one to give a shot at. You don't need money to play either. You might just want to get yourself into the FE games series after playing this. ;)",
        "Been having this app for a year now and yet I haven't thought its a waste of space at all! It's extremely addicting and makes you want to play more. Its also nice how the creators interact with the community alot and listen to our feedback. Its also nice to have a game that's constantly worked on and it just keeps improving. The art and the voice acting it also a big pro for this game. It really does capture the characters personality,even if it is a few words. The art is simply amazing. I appreciate the artists for thier hard work. Would definitely recommend it if you like RPG games.",
        "Turn based strategy rpg. If you've never played a Fire Emblem, time to remedy that. Fantastic depth and graphics for a free game. This feels like a full blown complete Nintendo title I'd expect to see for $30 for Gameboy brand new. At the price of nothing, everyone should try it.",
        "This is a work in progress. I am a huge fan of Fire Emblem, Sacred Stones and I really wanted to love this right out of the gate.  It has made a good start.  All maps are a set size, something like 6x8, with two teams of 4.  No terrain bonuses, no special conversation where one of your characters can convince one of them to join you, ALL attacks result in hits of a predetermined amount, no crits/no misses, no permadeath.  Voiced characters are a nice plus from the old GBA days. This is as close to a real Fire Emblem game as a mobile, free to play will get, and the devs keep changing up stuff to keep it interesting. Great game!"

        "Love this little game! I wish we had five life's, Three just gets me started. But overall, it's a great game. Getting like Candy Crush the higher the level the more impossible it gets to finish. Please don't make it so hard to win. I keep having to use coins to buy lives. Can never build up enough to amount to anything. Also you can give cash on the scratch off card. PLEASE !!!",
        "Very hard and not as fun as the other games but  because you cannot even solved one level in a 3 lives. My friends do not want to play when I showed them how it is being played. I've noticed that the first part of level 3 is more fun now than before. But still the 2nd and 3rd level is very hard. I admire those who completed the whole cities. They must be geniuses in algorithms in solving the 9 moves in one level. The most amazing part of this game are the graphics.  Awesome really awesome.  Very well done. Still playing this game but also still cannot convince my friends to get out of CC and other games. Will keep on trying though.",
        "This game is set up to STEAL a certain number of lives before you can win a level. Some levels, like Venice, level 79 may never be won. I have bought extra lives twice, extra moves twice, I REFUSE to make anymore purchases. If this was a truly user friendly game, it would BANK any extra moves, lighting, and other bonuses you've earned but did not use. But no, it throws them out. STEALS what you have earned. BANK it for me, I earned it, I should get to keep it. I'm done with this game.",
        "I am glad for the staff at big fish they did a wonderful job getting me back play after all my levels where lost.. They found them all and it made me happy that i can play where i was.. I can not play to often sometimes and had taken me a long time but look forward to every new city i get to open a new and all the challenges i get to participate in.  Thank you all for this game",
        "Fantastic game!  I love the graphics and interesting bits of trivia shared every time a landmark is built.  I also like the extra daily challenges and the special events that open up every so often.  Gummy Drop is challenging but can be played without needing to make any in-app purchases.  One con: the game starts you with three lives (lives replenish after 20 minutes), but in order to permanently increase your lives to five, you must pay $10.",
        "Surprisingly fun! I was setting the ads for this game everywhere but thought they were really unappealing. Work on your ads a little to emphasize the fun prizes for completing levels, the enjoyable hunt for tour letters in old levels, the history of the buildings you save! So many great things happening in this game."

But there's an issue, Roblox pleaseeeee fix the lag and add more available controls for mobile pocket edition is solo laggy and some gears to use are un available to use and not able to okay most of the games. The graphics are  really bad on mobile and you can't higher the graphics which is boring, but I still love this game its really fun.",
        "This game is AMAZING!!! Just fix a few glitches though. I play this game 24/7. I even get my tablet at bedtime and play on it. 1 last thing. Why did your moderators not get our reports and why can't we say simple words when we chat?",
        "It's a really great game but there are some flaws to it. First of the game is reall laggy for me and tends to always disconnect me in a game and I fell as if the reporting thing doesnt work either because they are never really blpcled for a while but those are tge only things but overall its an amazing game",
        "It really  depends on the game and how much effort the creator put into it. My favourite  game is Elemental Battlegrounds. Itwas created this year and the creator clearly put a bunch of time in making it. I love Roblox and most of the games on it. At least it it's a 3.9 out of5.",

If you dont want to spend real money then this game is not for you, you will get stuck on campaign like me and wont be able to upgrade your car for the next mission.",
        "This game is a lot of fun get to customize some great cars . A lot of my favorites and i was surprised to see some cool muscle cars . Very unique collection of cars. This is actually better than their console games. Well recent carbon and most wanted are amazing. The newest are hot garbage. This one is fun.reallywish there was free roam or a sand box room where you can admire and test drive  what you have grinded out so many hours to get. Only bad thing. Also the boxes are too expensive leaving having to grind way too much just for absolutely anything. By the time you get anything good this game servers will be empty.",
        "Thank you for making this awesome game, I love it! I've not had this much fun playing a Need For Speed game in years.. Update 2.9.1 is fantastic. Although after updating, I'm having trouble connecting to the game servers... :/ Hope it gets sorted soon! nevertheless, I look forward to future updates. ;)",
        "It's a great game, graphics are ok, smooth playing. But. There are some ideeas that may do something different. Think about a chat room, or a place where players can do some trades. Think about adding the possibility for players to get vip points for watching videos, or maybe one day..open world gameplay. And there could be a lot more features. Thumbs up if you agree.",
        "All round best racing game I have played so far! That said, the game becomes very difficult as one goes above REP 60. It becomes very time consuming to proceed in the game without spending actual money. Useful stuff becomes harder to obtain via docks and via older races, which is frustrating.",
        "The gameplay/races r so short. It takes less than a minute to finish it. And the police cars than u see in the gameplay don't even do anything they just keep going on on there own, sometimes getting to finish line before u. So basically this would be a perfect game for a three year old but incredibly boring for anyone over the age of 7"

        "Great game. Everything you could want in a game. Castle building, PvP. Unique equipment with special stats. Different attack types, economy classes. Rewards are rewarding enough. So far 5/5. The theme is good. The balance seems reasonable. My only suggestion is making to character limit for name changes bigger for the dwellers/subjects. Only thing I can constructively suggest. Or be able to type first and last name.",
        "Love the concept of the game but the moment you start reaching higher castle lvl  that's when you realize that if you don't pay you will be on a long journey, ie.. PvP are out of the question everyone has minimum of 5 epic items, arena you will have to settle for 5th or less place due to power lvl difference. I am about 141000 fighting 190000 or 90000, which is not fair for those of low power or advantage to those of high.",
        "After playing for a few hours this I find this game good my only problem is that you need to pay for those epic drops? I mean in a game if you defeated the boss those are supposed to be yours without paying, I can accept paying for 1 dollar but the second boss requires me to purchase it for almost $3 I already paid for premium I don't want to pay for other things. Please make the drops free for premium members or have them cheap or totally free, or else after my premium I'll quit this game.",
        "I loved this game very much, I had a lot of really nice things and invested nearly $60 dollars into making my guys 5 stars and diamonds and other level up promos... I was the clan leader of the \"Bananna Kings\" my main complaint is my phone rebooted and now I've lost everything... my game, my victories, my clan, and all the money I invested in this great game... please help. ;( my username on my good account is \"Skylark\"",
        "Loved playing the game, I just wish there was a balance in the PvP Tournaments, can't find a tournament where everyone else isn't 20000 Points over my guys. Please fix this!! Just put a bloody +/-5000 points deviation on it! Make it more enjoyable for people who don't buy everything they see",
        "best game on mobile i think. just make sure your account is linked to your facebook and google play so you dont ever lose your account i almost lost everything when my phone broke. luckly i got it to turn on for a bit before going off and linked my accounts. now im fine.."

I earn for attack/raid master and the counter doesn't update. Freezes in the middle of spins. Don't earn coins for watching videos sometimes. This is even after the most recent update",
        "its a nice game, but please rate the places lil bit low, it's hard to earn money, and when we save it for a place to buy, a raid takes place... increase the spin no. also atleast from 50 tp 60... it was fun at first.. but due to all this it's becoming boring.",

You'll be in s timed level and you lose time because you can't see under the words.  Some levels its ridiculous to have to do them 15 times to pass it",

But you cant get triangle unless circle is moved first. And mission failed because you didnt get diamonds in order. This is repeats over and over again. This is impossible to solve. I even had to deal with triangle being right down at the bottom. And all other diamonds at the top. I failed of cause. I am giving my view because I fed up with this stupid idea.",
        "Game updated now havent a clue what i need on level 421 and objects i need are blank boxes can play game but dont know what i need if any one can tell me object amount and what levels they are on it would be a help. Also have uninstalled game a installed it again but still dosnt help.",
        "I really love this game. But expeditions are more fun then the game itself. I really wish we could actually finish the expeditions instead , of not getting to finish the story behind them. Also during the expeditions to buy things are way to expensive because the amount of maic it takes to remove one item. Pls address these issuea. Really hope to see some expeditions we can really have fun and finish with.",
        "I love the expedition part but not enough time to complete them. Also i cut one tree down and have to wait an hour to cut another. Its takes to much magic to clear paths.Its hard to build the bridges and stuff because of this. Other then that i have no problem with it.",
        "Love the different puzzle styles that go along with the basic mahjong matching game. It gives an extra challenge to completing each game. Sadly I have only gotten to 250 levels after a year or 2 of playing because the puzzles are constantly rigged to lose. I am not a cash player as I have more important living expenses to spend money on so buying power ups and such are not an option for me. Would be great if there weren't so many losing games one after the other. I'm referring to the ones where you get to the last couple of tiles and the gems needed are at the very bottom so you are made to match the 4th set of gems when you are supposed to match the 3rd set first. I get multiple games where the matching tiles are stacked on top of each other so it requires a shuffle to win. As I said I am not and refuse to cash shop on a game that is not worth spending money as it is not a necessity so it would be nice to be able to progress without 10-15 losing games in a row. The spinning wheel doesn't always have ads available and I rarely get power ups from it. I mainly get paws."

Great job, and ty for  listening to players and making more  levels and changes and continued updating!  UPDATE: 2/2018 Please make more optional designs to find at neighbors' homes. I've been searching, and I can't find any more. Especially for the bathroom, and for the garden/flowers. That is one of the best features of the game. ty!         Thank you for the new update and new expansion!  Cant wait to achieve the new rooms. Best game!  Much better than \"Scapes\" Games. I like the way you can travel to neighbors to get new interior design fashions! A new idea that is brilliant. I am spoiled now! LoL Thank you and please keep up the hard work!",
        "Good game. Fun so far. I enjoy renovating the first room and the master bedroom.  So far I have only one complaint. Why can't I get the master bedroom? While I'm all for being generous, generosity has its limits and it is MY house. It might seem small to some but it does irritate me as I do love the story as one of the best bits. I'm not the only one who doesn't like her just claiming for herself. It comes across as rather arrogant and presumptuous of her. An idea might be to give me the master bedroom and then give her another where you can design it more to her tastes as a decorator.  Apart from that story issue just keep on going.",
        "Getting a little frustrated with this. I play on both my phone and tablet. When I try to play on my phone it asks me to update to synchronize my progress yet there are no updates available.  I have switched off and on and even uninstalled and reinstalled.  Very annoying that I cannot now play on my phone.  Just reinstalled this and it is working great now. Thank you for sorting. 5 stars all round.",
        "I am obsessed with this game! Love that you can easily make friends with other real players and use their furniture! Mixed levels of difficulty which means you never get stuck on a board for an annoying amount of time. Only thing is that when choosing your furniture, you have to click the picture a bunch of times before it let's you preview it.",

        "Repetitive game that requires a lot of thinking. Quite addictive as I've been playing for nearly year and half now. I didn't spend a penny on game but quite a lot of time. Its very difficult to be very good without spending real cash but it's possible. You can watch adverts for coins, so be patient and play. The more you play the more you get. You don't need top characters to have great team - you can create great team with average characters if you focus on weapons. Get yourself into a good team, hit faction's minimums and you'll become great.",
        "There are good and bad aspects of this game, but the pros out weigh the cons. You can absolutely level up incredibly high without spending a single penny on this game. You just need patience. One of the funniest aspects of this game is its long term playability. There is always something to do every day and in the long run it all adds up to your benefit.  My only complaint is the pop up windows when you first get on. They show you you've been raided...then you have the notification that you have to check that gives you the same info. If the pop up already gives me the info, why do I still have notifications?",
        "Ive been playing this for 2 years, love it but support is well below standard. I have a problem just now where it crashes every 5 mins and support do nothing. Its become unplayable. Avoid if you have a samsung device",
        "Rubbish repetitive game. After spending ten's of thousands pointlessly I can tell you honestly... don't waste your time or money. It's a very addictive cash cow and just a very smart way to take your money and keep you hooked. Scopely has repeatedly lied and will continue to do so. You have been warned",
        "The game has slowly been turning more p2w than ever before. Before 6 stars had come into play, you could easily get any 5 stars. Even some p2w toons were able to be accessed later on in some events. With 6 stars, this really isn't the case. This has also caused the Road to Survival community to become more toxic and started making the game unfair/not fun for other players.",
        "I like the strategy involved in playing the game. The only thing I think I would change is when you kill an enemy and he comes back to life,  they should come back as a zombie. .not keep all their ability before death. .otherwise it keeps you interested."

        "Overall game is very good n addictive, been playing the game for awhile now. 1 major issue of the game is bugs that cause the game to lag esspecially after every game update. Reali hope Pocket Gems will look into this matter seriously and build a better game foundation. I will review my ratings when the game is more stable.",
        "LOVE THIS GAME!! unlike other timed games you don't have to wait around.  When things are upgrading you can literally spend hours if you want just attacking other bases and breeding dragons.  Graphics are amazing and this is one game that constantly has me coming back.",
        "Wonderful game, all these pay to win comments are slightly misleading. There are several power ups and time reducers that come fairly easy if you participate in events. Which, the events are almost always going on so you don't get bored!  Only problem I have is that the app keeps uninstalling itself from my phone. Not sure if it's the app's fault or my phone, but it doesn't happen to any other app on my phone...",
        "PG needs to fix a lot of stuff. They never listen to the community and with the Atlas update has destroyed many alliances by creating a class divide between teams of all ranks. Huge let down and am afraid of the future of the game when game design decisions like this are allowed to occur.",
        "Fun until you have to wait a day to do something. How can you play a game if the game won't let you play, but by good it takes up space. So you want me to have a game taking up space in my phone but I'm can't play the game. So it is literally a waste of space.. developers are stupid and selfish."

I've come to really enjoy the speed duel format as it works great for mobile gaming. Having only 3 Monster spaces and spell/trap spaces makes you think about what you are using."

It takes way longer and as players we dont have all day to play even if we used boosters and in game cash !",
        "Wonderful game indeed. The only thing is missing is the financing part. Would be really nice to have a banking inductor a stock market where you could trade financial products like other cities bonds or debt. Financing during the game can be a big problem so having a financial hub from where you could trade and borrow would be really useful. Thank you for developing this amazing game.",
        "This game is crazy and awesome at the same time. My population has been awesome. Just 2 months and it was from 0 - 92 000+! The crazy part is when I see a blue hospital sign, the people dont even tell good reasons. ALL THEY DO IS SAY, Sometimes I go to the clinic just to read MAGAZINES! My citizens are so crazy JUST BEACAUSE IN ONE HECTARE, I AM A GOOD MAYOR!",
        "Too much waiting for things to get made and produced. The storage and items for upgrades FAR too difficult to get. 42 items to raise storage by 5 items. And it can take weeks to find all the items. When you go to global storage and find an item that you really need, by the time that you get there, it's already sold! 😠 Also, it takes 3 different items, and you have 3 of one item and 24 of another. Really? Also, it should be that you get needed items more often, randomly rather than at specific times. Other than that, a good game.",
        "Like the competition challenges it holds your attention. the time frames of production are a little long however the markets move products fast. I also like the club wars and the mayors challenges. My dislike is there are not enough thought bubbles in the fact that you only get two the rewards should be more frequently.",
        "The new arenas for war are terrible... There is a massive lag time... I can't even get to the war after rebuilding until the game thinks for approximately 45 seconds... By the time I actually get one shot off it's a minute and a half... Then I'm almost dead and you come back with I'm sorry we're experiencing connectivity issues get it fixed please!"

        "Sometimes I would give it a five star other times 4 star. Good number of challenge keys per visit to none challenge sites. As few as two visits needed for one visit to challenge site in final level of challenge (requiring 25keys). Love the two modes for cards of fate. No time limit but fewer tries works great if you write down what you find. It surprisingly has improved my timed play of this mini game. There are getting to be too many items and NO search functions to facilitate where to find a particular item, what collection items belong to if someone wants it and you don't want to send it anonymously (case if you send a requested item) and don't send it from the gift bar. One of the better hide and find games.",
        "I changed my previous rating. There are so many glitches, especially with new events  and support doesn't respond to requests. I haven't gotten totem bonuses for three days and new event is nearly impossible at times to find bunnies and objects. This used to be my \"go to\" stress reliever but now it just creates more stress.",
        "Instead of relaxing me this game stresses the hell out of me. New bunny location is extremely hard to find the 🐇. And the time limit is too short. I know im wasting my time writing this cause I've seen a lot people complaining about it and nothing is been done. Will be unistalling if it doesn't gets fix. Good day",
        "The main complaint is that some tasks have insanely short timers, like for the new event where you have to find optionnal stuff that's really well hidden as well as the usual pack of items that usually takes the whole timer to find. Great game, bases itself too much on money dropping.",
        "The only thing I don't like about the game is that by the time you search a couple of places (depending on ur level) is how long you have to wait to get enough energy up to search again. Depending on what you want to search it can take up to an hour or more to get the requirements. Other than that I really like the game."

        "Love the game. Definitly think 8ts rigged on tower of fortune for sure. Az for going through 3 different phones with the app i have actually had luck linking it with my fb never had an issue. It would be alot better if non active clan members could get kicked. Im trying to achieve the legendary chest which is impossible with maybe only 8 active people. Other than that its pretty addicting. I play every morning before work and every night before bed. Plenty of levels to keep busy!",
        "The puzzles are interesting, the animations are generally enjoyable. It quickly becomes a grind, though, where you aren't enjoying the gameplay, you're just trying to get past the timewasters of the daily challenge, or fighting the arbitrary points of the arena. The clan battles and Mighty Eagle challenge are the best parts, but you can't play them all the time. You have to grind away in the Arena.",
        "I just purchased a new phone. And being I'm using the same e-mail address i would have thought it would have started me at the same level I had been on prior to the new phone. Kinda sucks because i had spent a near fortune and was at level 64 ! Unless they can fix this I will remove the game for good. I mean I had every hat except the ones that cost 25,000. Now I'm at zero!",
        "RESUBMITTED: Arena games were sucked up by those high-card players or maybe cheaters. My power cards are the same, just like my opponent, or higher than my opponent's cards. When I slinging those piggies or blocks, it gives me lower points like 4 hundred thousand. But if my opponent slinging them all, it gives higher points like 7.5 million. I lost my winning streaks so I had to play again but it gives me same points so I lost again, sadly. I thought your arena games are really much fun, but they're not.",
        "Classic gameply bogged down by aggravating fremium distration. Havent run into any energy bars yet and already on second world. New birds add interesting gameplay elements but spells are an automatic win that add no semse of achievement besides skipping a hard level. If you want some classic angry birds but dont mind clicking through to get to it then give this a download.",
        "I really think the tower is rigged. 1 in 4 chance of getting the pig but it seems to happen ALL the time. Cant get past the 6th or 7th floor. However if you spend lots o money to buy gems I guess it can be done. Not for me I am out."

        "I love this game. Its very addicting and fun, but I find that there are barely any female dragons. This upsets me very much and I would like for this to change. The only females I see are the dragons with names like  motherly dragon, belle dragon, viktoria dragons, and sleeping beauty dragons. There are also descriptions like \"add some girly pink to your collections with the gummy dragon\"(which is also coincidently a girl). Then I see cool legendary dragons, but OH plot twist they're all boys. This is a very fun game no doubt on that, but please, stop with the sexism and make cool female dragons. Thank you.",
        "Still Having Lot's of Fun! Cool to mix different dragons just to see what u get!  I just opened my 6th island, When I first started playing this game I think there were only 3 or 4 islands & maybe about 300 to 400 dragons. I'm having trouble keeping them long enough to get the next island!😉😄😁!!",
        "Game would be great except for the fact that you can't do certain things without bugging people on Facebook for help. I just want to play the game. I can't level my dragons past 10 without building a special building which you build without gems or bugging people. No way to get gems other than extremely slowly by completing achievements which take days to complete and give 1-3 gems. Supposedly you can watch videos for gems but there is absolutely no place on the game that allows this. If your friends on Facebook don't play this game they can't help you and you are screwed if you truly want to enjoy the game. You can't win battles with level 10 dragons. You can't breed more than one dragon at a time without gems. You can't expand past 2 islands without gems. If you get the required gems to level your dragons past 10, then there is another super expensive building to level them past 15, and get, guess what, you need gems for that too. Other games allow in game friends which this one doesn't and that is frankly ridiculous as it's a \"social\" game. Other games allow other ways to obtain gems like watching videos or trying other games which this one doesn't. There isn't enough time to complete special events for special limited dragons unless you can get gems. Overall, the game would be fantastic if gems were easier to come by and you could make in game friends instead of having to rely on Facebook friends!",
        "Just a few gripes. 1st of all I LOVE DRAGON CITY. Been playing for years. About your survey, I would never. You ask for too many permissions. Tree of life....when I get a Dragon here comes the same Dragon adding up for hatching. Like why? 815+ dragons are more than enough. Why do u keep adding, adding, adding. We could NEVER get all of them as it is. Why more? Love me some Dragon City like a said in the beginning.",
        "The game is amazing, addicting and a lot of fun just to collect and level up dragons. The events that are constantly coming on always make you feel like you have something to do. However when of the events are very unbalanced and, if you are against one of these people, not very fun. The heroic races are a great way to compete with other players to add a powerful dragon to your collection but some people take the fun out of it by spending 100's of gems to ensure that they come first. The ability to use gems during these races should be removed as it is highly unbalanced, or at least add another way of collecting the heroic dragons without having to compete with people who pay to win.",
        "THIS IS THE BEST GAME EVER!!! I totally recommend it to EVERYONE who loves addictive games and dragons. I find myself constantly playing this game all the time! I honestly feel like I can't say how much I LOVE this game with words. Again, this is the best game a player can have. Just one thing, I wish there were more ways to get gems instead of just buying 'cause I can't buy anything. So please make gems more easier to get. Also please make the islands worth less gems.😊"

I think people forget that your \"FREE\" games have to make money some how to pay developers, animators, IT support and more. Either they have dozens of ads everyday (DK has a few but not dozens) or premium paid content.",
        "Most addictive game! Playing it since it 1st started. Love the new mystery event it's so adorable except your missing one vital character!!  I think there's a couple points to improve on... the send home button in the characters actions list I think should be up the top and smaller instead of scrolling down for it cos I use it often. 2nd all of the sounds in my game are very poor, it's nearly always silent and music is always late. Haven't heard the high 5 sound in ages 😔 please fix the sound!",

Now the game keeps closing out on me when I'm trying to do something. Think you guys can fix this somehow?  I'd appreciate it if you do. Thanks in advance.",

Then an update came and After that update now the consetion stands close out the game anytime I want to view. Now with winnie the poo update the whole dam game is slow. Seriously thinking of quiting. It doesn't matter every update has a glitch. Can't u guys fix it? Or is just me?",

That is quite distracting..especially when I don't know what their purpose is.  Also..I wish their leveling up and their quests weren't so long..I only get to play about 5 minutes. But I do love the game",

I have only 1 problem with this game, it does not count time when you go out of the game or close your phone. It might just be me, but if it wasn't for the bad saving, I would have given this game 5 stars, since it deserves it, or even more."

        "A wonderful survival game that Ive been enjoying nonstop for around a week. I personally have not experienced slow loading, and the rare items to find are fun for me, not too hard. The controls are great and graphics a+. (they also keep adding new fun stuff that makes the game fun to play for even experienced players) great game 😀",
        "This is not actually a review its more like tips for those who like to play the game. I started playing on December and I already have a chopper. I could easily build a second one. The alpha bunker is the best place to get parts. Try using the traveller and selecting 5% chance to find a car part before you open the treasure boxes. Keep the best weapons for the  bunker.  Spots that appear on the main map that have timers are the only places you will find your body incase you die out there. If this is helpful I will give more tips on clothings.",
        "I really like the game. It's fun and addicting, with patience.  My only complaint is that everytime i die,  which is often,  i lose all my stuff and can never find my body again.  I can't build most of what I'm able because I'm still trying to gather from the first levels.  I die instantly at every aggressive player I encounter.  Maybe there is a trick to finding my stuff that I don't know.",
        "WARNING: every time you update the game, it cannot connect to your google play account for god knows how many hours or even days! The risk of losing all your progress is VERY high. If when starting the game you don't see the \"Restore\" button, quit immediately and start again after few hours when (and if) the restore button appears again. If you can't restore your progress and continue playing without restoring, then all your progress is lost!",
        "I love the game. But seriously? You get 1 energy every 5 minutes and at minimum need 13 energy to get somewhere... Also why do you stop letting us watch ads? It gives you money and helps us in-game. Please add faster energy recharge and unlimited ads. Because taking away ads is a little much..",
        "I'm done with this game... I have spent hours on it and despite being level 99 the game has stagnated. This latest update... Who the hell cares about a dog when you can't even keep a jacket for more than a trip to a location... Update has lost my account again and do you know... I think that I have had enough. I'll come back if you do ever finally release it which I don't think you will until you stop wasting time on pointless additions and concentrate on the core gameplay.sort yourselves out, I am going to find another game."

        "Ok best game ever. I always dreamed of playing games like pubg or ml something like that but its just not my thing yknow? How its hard to control and super annoying to play. But this god this takes the trophy. Easy control, fun game play, get to live again after dying so no need to be sad so yeah well done gi",
        "Update: Game was fixed very fast and is my favorite game. Everyone should download and play this game. It's simply amazing with great graphics!!! Only thing is why can't we have a woman character? I'm a woman in real life and want to play one online too!!! When are you all going to add women characters???",
        "Graphics are good an Gun play is pretty fair. When battling the game goes on runs where I get matched against teams whos members are way stronger then my team an I. Then it goes back to fair match making.   3 Month UPDATE: The game has turned into a money grab. You have no chance to compete against players that drop a bunch of money an have 4 an 5 star guns. This was the top shooting game in my opinion, but turning it into a pay to compete killed the fun with this game. Havent been match fairly against players in a couple weeks now. I would recommend trying a different p vs p shooting game.",
        "Amazing game, however there is one small problem, but not enough for me to not give it 5 stars. Recently when I've been watching an ad to double the reward at the end of the battle, the video has played until the end and it says the reward has been doubled, but I only receive the regular reward? It has happened 15-20 times and it's getting slightly annoying, as I'm about 4000 gunbucks short of what I should be now. Anyways, thanks for making such an awesome free game with little to no adverts!  UPDATE: video watching for additional rewards does not work with anything. No extra crates or supplies",
        "One of the best fps I've played. Graphics is cartoonish but fun, Remedy is underpowered in the sense that it doesn't generate a decent HP on each hit. On lower levels, it's decent but on higher levels against Porcupine, Ranger, Thunder it doesn't stand a chance that could be balanced out by either increasing the rate of fire or increased health generation on each hit , Lifestealer is pretty darn awesome but could do better with a bit smaller crosshair and little bit more accuracy",
        "Initially the game seems super addictive but once you hit level 16 it gets ridiculous. You have players who have spent money on guns and you're practically no match. Also the teaming of players should be balanced out. Another thing is even if you win a match you win around 30 trophies, if you lose there's a loss of 60 and if by chance you're internet is bad and you automatically get kicked out and cannot reenter you lose a 100 .Eventually you get sick and tired of all this and the game gets boring."

        "If you like base building war strategy games then please download this app. It's an game that has constantly going back. Although you have many in app purchases available you can play without spending any real money and be competitive. The developers award you with more than enough items on a daily basis. It's definitely a must have for fans of this game type.",
        "I'm sure this is a fun game, however I do not see the reason why it needs to have permission to manage my phone calls or know my location if I never plan to use any online abilities. That is just too much access to my phone. I did not even get a chance to play the game because it wanted that access on start up; it will not allow you to play the game without give permission.",
        "It's a great strategic game. PvP is more event driven rather than a free for all.Great value for the money you spend whether it's a little or a lot...and the purchases give a little free to your team. Lots of ways to win free stuff and points you can spend on items needed in alliance store and keep up with your wallet warrior team mate. One downside is the support..they can be a little sliw in response time to problems. But they don't just ignore you either.",
        "Why does this app request access to make calls/read sms/messages? Un-installed right away.  Edit: That's not how it works. Just because you say \"your phone is safe\" doesn't make it safe. You're still getting the permission from un-educated users that you can read their messages. That's very shady.",
        "it was a good game but after playing it a month the server has errors. I lost 50% of my troops in my main castle which went missing, lost 1 m of power, my farms was plundered and troops in my farms was massacred. Reported the issue but they ROK did not bother to give me a courtesy reply so if you decide to play but sure the system does not steal your time and effort playing the game.  Plus the added frustration"

After this last update I lost slot. It started off awesome but once I started investing money in the game it's like it just took my money by taking the gifts and coins.  Such a waste of time and money when no corrections are made.  Trying to give the developer a chance to redeem themselves from this error.",
        "I like the idea of changing prices and finding new recipes. I want the barista to automatically start the machines if there isn't one already there. i want to be able to hire another barista. I want to put my menu on the other wall. I want smaller windows. There's basically a lot of things i feel limited on and i still haven't figured out if i can change the color on wallpaper or not.",
        "I watched the 4 adverts and got a no diamonds for the doing so. I also watched the the add to pick a bonus prize, never got a that either. I used to play this game a lot and I've noticed the prices of everything have went up and including the spices. You no longer have the option to buy the cheaper furniture forcing you to spend more so customers come in to the Cafe. Very greedy and game makers. Sort these issues and give me the diamonds I'm owed or take away the ads.",

After certain update my game will start to reverse progress itself when one message pop out and state \"profile change, please restart\".

Im so fed up with this and quit for few days, wish developer can fix or lessen this issues or i will just uninstall it one day, thanks for reading.",

        "It's a nice game, with a great graphics and such but the auto-update for extra files it's kind of annoying. Is there anyway to turn it off? Because we have to waiting for it to be downloaded before can play again. Can we choose to update whenever we want?  Anyway, this is a really nice game and I've been playing it for a long time. Keep up the good work!",
        "I love the game. There's nothing wrong with it because I feel like it's the old game that I grew up with. But what I hate is that the prices for packs, lp, sp and simoleons went high. The prices before was okay but now I don't think I will spend anymore for packs that give only like 5vip points. Such a fun game but aimes for large microtransactions.",
        "I really enjoy this game, and love developing my Sim's homes and the world. Unfortunately, my game won't open. It hasn't for about a month now, even after this new update. It shows me the loading screen for five minutes, then crashes. It would be wonderful if there could be a fix for this.",
        "Love love love it! This game is actually better than The Sims Mobile... 2 problems,, 1st. The Modern houses with second floor, so expensive😭! 2nd. The time it sometimes takes ages just for one activity!😐 but hey, everything else.. TOTALY AWSOME! 😍 thanks so much for creating this game. Cuz its so hard to download the sims 4 in a Mobile. 💕",
        "This is actually cool and I really love this game. However, the expiration of most of the quest that i'm having are only 2 days to finish. I think it's unfair, and the materials needed are too expensive. Sims are busy on finishing tasks so they won't be able to go to work and earn. So I'm not totally enjoying the game.",
        "When you get an event sometimes it only lasts for like 2 days which really isn't enough because some actions take 1 day. Please extend event times and don't give like 5 events at the same time. Also you should be able to log in other ways apart from Facebook because lots of people don't have Facebook. Please make other ways for us to login  so we can get more neighbours."

So when you start the game app the first time, the intro audio blasts in your face! after you log into your account, game play is silent.",
        "It's been ok so far, I personally don't enjoy the auto feature but I get why it's there... I'm a busy person I have other stuff to do while I really want to game. Of course, the pay2play option is there otherwise you grind like ALL mmorpgs. Which I don't see the problem with... it's a free game ppl and a pretty decent one at that.",
        "Not only is it laggy, now after loading and installing the recent update, I can't even log in. After log in screen and after it checks for any update, it logs me out to main menu! This is ridiculous! After spending real money with this game you deny me access? So!ution required please asap.",
        "After update, not able to log in. Game crashes all before loging in. Either you fix it today, either i will demand for money return. I have payed money, not to be unable to log in. Do it today, or return money payed.  Since you have not attempted to fix the issue, i demand full refund for the purchases i made. Expect refund and reply! You HAVE to give any reply.",
        ".... Like the 100 or more people before me after the March 14th update I'm no longer able to log in for some unknown reason.. No info on the netmarble site about this issue which is odd.. I actually liked this game but this is really nad customer support.. Well time for a new time sink I guess..",
        "Game is a decent time waster. It's true that it is tedious if you're not willing to blow an inhuman amount of money. The recent update is causing the login screen to be unresponsive to my touch, and I cannot log on. Not terrible otherwise.. Samsung galaxy s8 active."

        "Matt seems like kind of an asshat in Season 2. She should just dump him. Could do way better. Like with Daryl perhaps? He obviously cares for her wayyy more than Matt does. Matt only has eyes for Lana. Like he says he loves our girl? I don't think so. I wish you could choose somebody else to date.",
        "Energy is too short & there isn't anything other than a side game for 100 more points to keep you entertained. The app is basically a story with a couple of nice artistic pictures.  Way over priced. You can buy a book for less at Barnes and Nobles and still get twice the amount in content. The the amount of money they ask for engery in this game is ridiculous. Don't be silly  and spend money that you can do better with. Just play for free or not at all.",
        "I think it's a good game but... Let's be fair you don't get to play for long each day before you run out of energy and have to wait 24 hours and even then it's only a few minutes play.... The lack of play time makes me loose all interest in what I believe might be a decent game",
        "So. This is an addictive store. The main characters are very well thought out. A few Grammer error and hick ups in game play. Although this game can be expensive if you don't make the right choice. I had bought the same secret scene twice and it still asks me to buy it. This is the second time this has happened. All in all great game.",
        "I find it aggravating that your energy goes down so fast. You get a few seconds of free play per day. I've paid to get more. But I can't and won't keep doing that when even paying for extra doesn't last long. 😒"

        "Awesome game.  Biggest downside I don't like is, unlike similar games, once the small packs are bought you are only offered the largest ($50/$100). I'd honestly like to see all packs back or at least if you're going to tier up buying options, at least offer a $25 as lowest.",
        "Once you loose the shield, you will get farmed by higher level players, forcing you to use whatever resources you have left over to repair. Once you finished repair, you not surprisingly get attacked again. This results you in being frustrated and uninstalling or you foolishly spend your hard earned cash for resources that you will soon enough loose from being attacked.",
        "Why do you need a commander to be sent to gather resources? This is absurd! I need troops to gather but then again I want my commanders to attack renegades and stuff! Please make gathering without th e need to send a commander with troops!!",
        "Don't waste your time unless you are going to spend large amounts of money. Free to play players get attacked daily by credit card players and you dont get a chance to progress. Good idea for a game but sadly very imbalanced.",
        "Overall an excellent game IF you have an alliance to back you up.  Otherwise you are a sitting duck. I recommend this game anytime to anyone because you do a lot in half an hour.   Only option I request is warlords events diring the weekend.  Poly and Thor are critcal resources and there never seems to be enough unless you pay for it.",
        "Again the only way to move forward is to pay large amounts of money.!!! every rss is so scarce to retrieve and trying to obtain VIP is I don't even know how without paying money.... the chat is just plain messed up also..."

        "I like the games but.. I would rather go to a real casino if i wanna spend and win REAL money, so buying coins with REAL money just for innocent playtime is a Big turn off for me. You lose coins fast like the real slots, unfortunately. I just start playing the game for the first time and I'm already out of coins. I believe they start you off with a low amount because I'm already out of coins in 30mins of play. The games and the graphics are fun though, which makes it attractive to play. My only complaint is paying for those coins..",
        "Had friends refer me to the  games. At 1st I wasn't  happy I couldn't  just  select  the games I wanted to play I had to earn the level it was on to open them. It's  actually  been kinda fun trying to advance  to get to the games  I want to play  . Been a HOF \"groupie\"  for  3 years now and enjoy the bright colors,  games & especially  how fast technical support will respond  when the. System  jams up. . Thank you.",
        "The variety of games are great, and I would enjoy playing them if I didn't lose all my money within 30sec... It's totally ridiculous to only get $800 every couple of hrs when the cost to spin one time is $250! Also, the big spin wheel sucks too... Instead of the normal $800, I get close to $2000. Big woop. Give more $ or make the spins less!",
        "If you like slots this app is great. Gives free chips/credits every 4 hours but for more free chips you have to go on the HOF Facebook page in order to participate in their daily contests plus click on links to collect more free chips. Sometimes I collect chips for a few days without playing in order to save up a larger bank so when I do play Im able to raise my bet & win more. But if u bet too much per spin (based on ur total chip bank) you will loose 99% of the time.  Wish I cd Win more contests!",
        "Short reviews are tough as any gambling game if ya win it's fun & great. If you lose it sucks! Cash purchases of chips & extras disappear super fast! The 3 hr wait to collect a few coins is very long. Then the SPIN has not given me a BIG pay out ever & I've been at x 2.0 forever. I hope you listen to your patrons & investigate & consider meeting our concerns at least some of the way. We know you make TONS money also! Consider smaller costs on packages if your not going to ever let us win! Tyvm",
        "Have so much fun playing this. It's nice to be able to have a \"flutter\" and not use real money. Good fun, great graphics and so many different slots to choose from, plus the rewards are well worth it. Thank you hof! Awesome!! Love this game!

        "I'm not a fan of mobile gaming, but this game is truly something else. I love The Walking Dead, so I gave this a shot, however, after playing Road to Survival (or whatever it's called- it's the TWD game based off of the comics), my expectations were pretty low. This game though, is not Road to Survival; it's so much more. This is how you do a free to play game with microtransactions right. You can buy a lot in this game with money, but you can easily obtain everything on your own, and quite frankly, it's more fun to do that anyways. This game is super addicting and gives me something fun to do when I've got a few minutes. I've been playing it for months, and I don't plan on stopping anytime soon.",
        "Just a suggestion, it'll be SO MUCH MORE AWESOME probably 10 stars for TWD fans if you could do better missions or events that allow us to get better opportunities to farm for TWD character tokens or class tokens, and also more chance for farming or creating weapons instead of the current set up now. Don't quite like the fact that when deals are awesome but they cost a ton! Try lessen the value a little bit and im sure some players dont mind spending (just my opinion). But overall review, its awesome for TWD fans out there!",
        "It's got good action in graphic. Been playing for a 2 years in 10 month's now.Stay human and Survive.  Up dates all the time love it keep them coming Robert Cregman. Thanks for making the Walking  dead show And game. New stuff to do all the time. In wow all these new survivers. There are some loading issues action issues movement issues alot more mission.",
        "Originally gave you 4 stars, but its one of only a couple of mobile games I have never deleted since installing. Constant content coming in, great use of TWD licence! Keep up the great work- seriously from someone who hates most mobile games!",
        "I've been playing for over 2 years. A few more new maps would be nice and stop nerfing our great traits like interrupt and wrestler! Other than that, great game and great community.",
        "Really good strategy game. The thing that lost it the 5th star is that when I started a second game on another device, it won't play ads for free stuff"

        "This game has been great to me forever, and I never had a complaint but this recent update has driven me here. The trophy cap is a real kick in the nuts and ruins the game for casual gamers like me. You now HAVE to advance through the games prestige system and keep resetting all your work just to help out a gang. And if you are in a strict gang like I am, they require 100 trophies a day. If I keep advancing, I won't be able to keep up with that. This is all a money grab by zepto now. They want you to have to pay to keep your machines strong so you can compete.",
        "I love this game. I have been playing it for a very long time. I play it every single day. I like the new updates however it seems you are getting away from the original game and focusing more on ultimate machines. Increasing the prestige levels was awesome but you need to also add additional upgrades with them as well. I have over 100 paw upgrades that are completely useless to me at the moment.",
        "Look this was a great game, worthy of it's previous accolades. Sadly since then it's been progressively ruined by an ever more aggressively enforced attempt to move to a pay to win model. Previously you could achieve anything in the game with a bit of hard work, then they tweaked it and you could achieve anything with a bit of hard work and team work. Sadly though what's happened is soft paywalls have been introduced, things you can't outright buy, but will only manage with financial outlay and change after change is being introduced with new soft paywalls and new ways to try and cash grab. The game is on a steady but rapid downward decline and to any new players I would avoid picking it up and investing your time in it now.",
        "Update: Now it won't even open. Once you find out your progression is rigged, the fun wears off. You will have a win streak going, them \"mysteriously\" a machine will show up with just the right set up to beat yours. Then once you finally get the right configuration to beat that one (however long that takes) another machine with the perfect set up to beat yours shows up again preventing you from progressing. Over and over and over....",
        "Great game, easy to play and a good time waster. One thing I would like to see in a future update  is a scroll bar for the parts in your garage. It would make it a lot easier than swiping through them, especially for those who have a lot of spare parts like myself. Other than that, awesome game.",
        "This game sucks. First it is really hard to get good equipment. Then it is also very laggy. Everytime im playing the game it freezes right when im doing something. (Mainly when im customizing my car). Think about it when you are getting ths game to take up storage. If you'll excuse me now I've got a game to delete."

        "It's a very realistic tycoon games. Had lots of run buying 'real' properties as I travel. The market place bidding section is like a trading floor.  🌟  because the bugs are not being fixed and is affecting game play. Added on 5/3/18 I have been writing to you about this issue. The fix you provide doesn't last.",
        "It was a great game..... until they started removing coins from your balance after watching ads.... I sent a support ticket and they told me it is a known issue, but there's nothing they can do to fix it... And they would not credit me back my lost coins!",
        "This game is interesting. It isn't time consuming, which is good and it is still be entertaining.Every 2-3 days I check on the game to wait till my money is full and I buy new properties which, I have to admit is quite satisfying. Especially if you own 100% of it.The only downside I could find is the coins system which gives upper hand for gamers that have money to spend into this type of game. However i still find it entertaining and I'm trying to make my own way through competition into getting first place on all rankings.  Edit:once you get rich you can't buy any properties, they're all cheap and not worth investment. You also need to play the game everyday and look for expensive properties that don't exsist. Buying properties from auctions is also not an option as most of the time it's not worth buying one.",
        "Fun and challenging.  It takes patience to excel. Sometimes the map needs updating (abandoned business block away) but dont buy those. Also id say skip watching ads for coins because they disappear.  Anyways, enjoy. Could be the lifelong game you've been waiting for!",
        "This is a game that is played with the real structures around you (like Ingress and Pokemon Go) but it's for buying, selling, and gaining revenue on real properties.  It's a pretty good game if you're in it for the long haul. The interface and graphics seem pretty old/bland, though.",
        "Great game and app. Developers do a great job updating it to make it better and responding to any questions in a timely manner. Very addicting real situation game. I love it. Just wish they would provide some incentives to those of us who purchase coins on a regular basis."

Edit- ok I'm in again, but I'm still mad, but relieved I didn't throw away my money. OTHER games send a apology message than an update is being performed or something. But as a game it is fun & strategic",
        "Would have given 4 stars if it didn't make you wait 4hrs on the pvp award or at least make the 4 he wait start when you first make the 1-5 match. Not wait 4 hrs after you complete 5-5. Look at how Clash Royale has their setup. Your already  trying to mimic their game. You should study their gameplay more and use it for improvements. Just saying. Make a change in that 4hr wait.",
        "Since the new update, major loading issues. Game just freezes on the title screen. I noticed that a lot of people have complained about the PVP battles not being fair, but they usually within reason. My main complaint is THE HACKERS WHO DRIVE ME TO THE POINT OF A MENTAL BREAKDOWN. This game has great potential, it just needs the major issues addressed.",
        "It's needed bug fixes for HTC One M8 since release. Current event RoboBebe stuck at applying configs. Matches work fine over my work hotel wifi but home wifi must reconnect after every match pvp or solo. 5* is my opinion regardless just 1* to try and catch devs attention",
        "Too many hackers since the beginning of the BFU!!! Too many are using a computer hack to play and cause energy speed ups. It causes the game to lag. Then I loose with an connection error or they just over power me with too many units on the field. Its ridiculous. I will change review when issues with them are fixed.   Now with one day to get to legendary tje game crashed...pathetic. Wish i could give a lower rating",
        "Would love to give 5 stars but I cannot even play. I downloaded, then went to play and got as far as the \"logging on\" page before the game said \"error no network connection\" when I clearly am connected.  EDIT : the issue has been resolved. Changed my rating to 5 stars as promised"

        "I love this game! Its BEYOND ADDICTIVE! There is no Methadone to cure or lure one away from the graphics, variety of bonus games or ever changing levels that erase reality and become the Pied Piper as its classical music lures one into its universe of gaming. This is a \"slot,\" which appeals to those who also enjoy a nether-universe of of scifi/fantasu. Its visually appealing, as well as, fun!!!! An AWESOME SITE!!!",
        "Yes it looks and sounds amazing. But short of that, this slot game is completely unremarkable. Just like every other slot game out there, wins are few and far between. The hourly bonus is weak aswel. When you're at a level that requires you to max bet (25000000 or more) and you win 1000000 on the hour bonus and have nothing in the credit meter due to the lack of free spins and no bonuses, it becomes very frustrating. Install if you're easily entertained by graphics and sound, because thats seriously the only thing you will get from this.",
        "THE PLOTS(NOT SLOTS,LOL)ARE THE BEST ,GRAPHICS ARE GREAT AND YOUR NOT JUST PLAYONG A SLOT,YOU ARE REALLY IN TO THE GAMES!!!!! I HAVE TO SAY IT JUST GETS BETTER AND MORE INVOLVED THE MORE YOU PLAY. THANK YOU.10+!It just gets better and better!!!!! Love it more and more!! thanks again THEY KEEP ME  EAGER TO GET TO THE NEXT ROUND OF  PLAY.   KEEP  THEM COMING. THANK YOU",
        "Used to be fun and worth maybe occasionally spending a few bucks on. Now early levels easier but struggle to ever get past first 3 levels. Seems to be just about getting you to spend real money now. Better have your big boy wallet or not worth installing. Really too bad.",
        "This is the best online slots game ever.  This game has so many awesome graphics and great prizes for everyone playing.  Thanks Murka for keeping for the last 2 years of  my sleeplessness nights soooo very interesting!!!!!  Luv ya bunches....waiting for more to come.....",
        "I love the graphics and the slot games, I really enjoy playing, but by level 70 some of the missions are just completely ridiculously high and for me that takes away some of the enjoyment, eg. Spin 700 times on max bet - that is just too much. How about give more variety of challenges rather than making them too hard to achieve or too long winded."

The ONLY hold backs is the controls, but u really can't do much about that problem unless u actually had physical/analog joysticks built n2 ur phone.?. The basic control problems u have w/ ne downloadable games.",

        "Love the game but in the last couple days, I'll get into a warp and it'll freeze completely on me. And It truly disappoints me because I could've had so many coins by now.

        "A well made app that's immersive, addictive, and the essence of the Kingdom Hearts franchise. The app is mission based and has a complex but easy to use medal system with rock-paper-scissors type of combat. You can join/make a party, or go solo. Money isn't an issue so long as you pace yourself. It gets better the more you play. There are optional event quests and a story, but don't fret if you can't get the app or just starting out; it's slow going. 735 quests.",
        "Liking the cute art style but my god does this game take forever to download even with a low resolution. Has taken me two attempts and I'm doubtful that it's related to my broadband speed and connection (not sure if it's to do with my phone? But again, doubtful.) Would be great if this could be fixed somehow.",
        "I freaking love this game! However I have a small complaint that is probably fixable. I was wondering for my lg g6 if you could expand the borders so the screen would fit. And if the screen is not able to get any bigger, I'm hoping you people can at least put a cool border around it instead of leaving it as a black bar. I know you people can make cool borders. Thanks for your attention!",
        "Hey guys, huge fan of the kingdom hearts series and also the game in general. Though one thing I wish you could add is the option to link your data to your Google Play account as well as Facebook. Not a lot of us use Facebook so I wish there was more options to get your data back if you ever deleted the app. Otherwise, good game!",
        "I love this game.  Strategy, adventure, and story (once you get far enough) are all great!  Although it is a little pay to win, and they keep coming out with new medals (attacks) that are infinitely better than your current ones.  This can get discurraging, because your hard work doesn't really mean much in the long run.    I played for 6 month when a friend got a single medal that made him more powerful than me on his 1st week playing.",
        "[Edit: THANK YOU SO MUCH! I love that you all added a lower quality version this way I can play this game.] I like it and all, but when that very large download starts after the tutorial, it stops at 4/6 and restarts, even though my phone has enough room for it, I think. Please fix this, I really want to play it!"

Today 2/4/2018 just lost a big piece of equipment..email the devlp... almost sure they are going to do nothing..this is a big lost.. do not invest in this game.",

        "Good game, good graphics,good sound. I like that it is on going, not like some similar games. I found it fairly easy to get used too. Plenty of choices and cars. I like that you are not constantly forced to spend real money in order to progress. That is a big plus for us game players. Well done all at EA, you have a real winner with this game. I personally am loving playing this game. Update, I have been playing for a few days now, the only drawback I have noticed is, the game takes up a lot of space on my device. Having said that, its so good its worth it. As previously, well done all at EA.",
        "Excellent game! I have no doubt that the game is one of the most perfect games. Everything but one thing. I just ran one race that comes with the actualization and I won around 5k, te first upgrade for the camaro Nascar costs around 130k does that even make sense. In the real life if you spend that money to make a competitive car to win that money... I hope you get my meaning",
        "The MOST AMAZING racing game in the mobile device. The gameplay, graphics, and the controls were perfect. Also, the tracks in the game were so real like I was racing in real life. I also loves the cars that were added in this game, it looks so amazing. But, what I like the most from this game was online real-time racing. There were no other racing games that has this feature. Just have suggestions, add custom race mode. In this mode, you can chose tracks, daytime, amount of opponents, and also the laps. And also enable to invite friends to custom race mode. Also, probably adding weather system will be better. Last, make the cars could do rev-bombing. So, at the start of the races, you could have some pretty good start. Although, keep it up Electronic Arts & Fire Monkeys. Hopefully, these suggestions could help the game become much better and better.",
        "Well,to start off, game really speaks for itself.Everything is pretty dope. I'm just going to name some things that I'm sure most of the people wants. -Dynamic weather conditions,how amazing snow day on Bathurst would be?Rain,wind,foggy... -Breakable parts, mirrors, spoilers,even wheels,and those should be on the tarmac whole race. -Drift events, I'm just going to say,we all want it. -More hatchbacks definitely,and more cars like its Jeep,or Ford Raptor,and you can add unique cars from movies,etc. -And sprint events,point to point.How fun is that. -More mountains!!! Please. Peace!",
        "the graphic, control, and gameplay is good as always, but the problem is, i played this years ago just with a device with 1gb RAM and i have mid-high graphic setting, but now im running with oppo a37f and i think it can run this game with a mid or mid 2 graphic setting... but no, my game always set to the lowest graphic, could you guys fix this problem? i love this game and i'd like to enjoy it in its best performance",
        "It's a great game where you can race and customise your own car. However here are some ideas I would like you the imlament please  1. If the cars from the NASCAR can get the custmizeing like all the others.   2. To extend the custmize can yo add a tab where you can put spoilers, air intakes And other things you would put on a car.  3. Finally to make this game real racing 3 if when a race of just go to see all the car you have.  There be a \"i\" button that will give the player real information about the car the player is looking at."

Im trying my best to play this game that i loved and win some good characters but why is it everytime in road to glory there is a network issue well in fact in other game modes there is none. PLEASE FIX THIS NET ISSUE WERE ARE TRYING OUR BEST TO WIN BUT ENDED UP LOSING BECAUSE OF THE NET ISSUE. . Thanks. I love this game so much so please be fair.",

        "Love the app and the game it is very addictive. I love the changes to season 4; however your ticket store and CP PVP store is still bugged as I am still getting cards well below my rank. Also PVP is very buggy as I am always seeing waiting for opponent or opponent is viewing last match which isn't an option. Just wondering if there is a security team that monitors online activity because it seems like a lot of people are manipulating the network at times.",
        "I like the game but last week 2 of my cards where removed I didn't accidentally delete them. They was locked. I emailed and got told that there was nothing they can do. It is a Titan pro Neville and a beast pro Tamina can someone help me get my cards back I played a lot of games to pro them right",
        "Horrible, disgusting excuse for customer service I have ever seen. Automated response no matter the issue. Never a problem ( and there are many many many issues.) Do not let the WWE license fool you, this is NOT a company I would support and I'm not sure why WWE can't find another company to produce a game.like this.",
        "They are still plagued by PVP issues that they claim they are fixing, but never do anything about. Not worth playing as you won't actually recieve your rewards for playing, and they won't help you if you send in a help ticket. You will only get form letter responses. WOULD NOT RECOMMEND."

Yet for some reason our offers are $160 AUD. $35 AUD more then we should be paying.   I do not know how this practice has gone without incident as I thought there were supposed to be good anti descrimination laws and consumer laws in place that prevent the charging of extra to countries just because they do not like that country.   This is a morally disgusting practice as it is the same concept as charging more to others purely on the basis because they have a different skin colour, gender or religion.   I want to know why Australians are paying an extra $35 AUD then we should be as other mobile games. One example being Battle Mobile do the correct currency exchange rate and only charge $125 AUD after conversion from $100 USD. If other mobile games do it correctly why are Plarium choosing not to?  Edit: @ Plarium employee who just lied in response to me. Plarium set all prices up themselves through Google Playstore. NOT Google.",

I've come to really enjoy the speed duel format as it works great for mobile gaming. Having only 3 Monster spaces and spell/trap spaces makes you think about what you are using."

        "Love this game better than any others. Since update seizes a bit in random games. Yesterday  I got golden phone and it seized the game and I missed out on coins.",
        "Great graphics, and there is a large variety of slots which I love! There is one for every holiday, plus cute ones and travel and animal. The payouts aren't quite as good, but maybe you just have to play more to see a good outcome. Overall a great slots game, with potential to be one of the best!",

        "I love your latest update! Also thank you for fixing the \"internet connection lost\" issue! 😊 Love the new character by the way! *-*)/ Great job!   I do have a suggestion, can you add like a one park/any place where players can meet with other players and chat? It would be great to interact with other players, not just in your guild group 😊 hoping you'll consider it. Thank you so much for making this game! So addicting!",
        "It'll be nice if we earn those ITEMS given in the stages description.  I kept on earning only common item no epic or legendary.  Which is sad but game is smooth which is good.  Thank you google for the update.  If we may add would love an auto healing potion during adventure. Thank you",
        "Edit: Issue was resolved and devs were very quick to reply and help, which they seem to do consistently. I really love this game because it's easy to get good equipment and currency, you aren't forced to pay to win. Rewards for login/quests are very generous, prices of cards to equip new items isn't unreasonable. The characters and items you can equip look stunning. The only thing I can criticise is the unbalanced PvP, but I solve that by not playing PvP lol.",
        "Marvelous heroes, outstanding graphics, excellent costumes, and cute pets. I realy like this game. But I hope this game would turn into an open world where all players could see each other at a single area. Perhaps a town or some kind of a city where everyone could gather and more features like whispers, world chat, etc. Well aside from that the game is totally amazing. Would much likely recommend this game.",
        "Great game beside the fact it is a memory-eater this is exactly what you expect from cell game in 2018 good graphic smooth gameplay and enough energy reward not to worry about beeing stpp because of a lack of it. The omly downside is the pvp which is build in a way you are up against player who 1HKO you which get pretty frustrating.",
        "Can't play the game after the latest update. I've downloaded the latest update, able to play it for few minutes. Then, it stop responding. When I tried to relaunch, after the Google Play Store and Nexus logo, it just stuck on the black screen. Nothing happened, waited for 5 minutes, still nothing happened. So I deleted the app and reinstall it. Still stuck on the black screen after the google plastore and nexus logo. Hopefully u guys patch this up ASAP, and I'll gladly change the rating once this is sorted out"

        "Ok best game ever. I always dreamed of playing games like pubg or ml something like that but its just not my thing yknow? How its hard to control and super annoying to play. But this god this takes the trophy. Easy control, fun game play, get to live again after dying so no need to be sad so yeah well done gi",
        "Update: Game was fixed very fast and is my favorite game. Everyone should download and play this game. It's simply amazing with great graphics!!! Only thing is why can't we have a woman character? I'm a woman in real life and want to play one online too!!! When are you all going to add women characters???",
        "Graphics are good an Gun play is pretty fair. When battling the game goes on runs where I get matched against teams whos members are way stronger then my team an I. Then it goes back to fair match making.   3 Month UPDATE: The game has turned into a money grab. You have no chance to compete against players that drop a bunch of money an have 4 an 5 star guns. This was the top shooting game in my opinion, but turning it into a pay to compete killed the fun with this game. Havent been match fairly against players in a couple weeks now. I would recommend trying a different p vs p shooting game.",
        "Amazing game, however there is one small problem, but not enough for me to not give it 5 stars. Recently when I've been watching an ad to double the reward at the end of the battle, the video has played until the end and it says the reward has been doubled, but I only receive the regular reward? It has happened 15-20 times and it's getting slightly annoying, as I'm about 4000 gunbucks short of what I should be now. Anyways, thanks for making such an awesome free game with little to no adverts!  UPDATE: video watching for additional rewards does not work with anything. No extra crates or supplies",
        "One of the best fps I've played. Graphics is cartoonish but fun, Remedy is underpowered in the sense that it doesn't generate a decent HP on each hit. On lower levels, it's decent but on higher levels against Porcupine, Ranger, Thunder it doesn't stand a chance that could be balanced out by either increasing the rate of fire or increased health generation on each hit , Lifestealer is pretty darn awesome but could do better with a bit smaller crosshair and little bit more accuracy",
        "Initially the game seems super addictive but once you hit level 16 it gets ridiculous. You have players who have spent money on guns and you're practically no match. Also the teaming of players should be balanced out. Another thing is even if you win a match you win around 30 trophies, if you lose there's a loss of 60 and if by chance you're internet is bad and you automatically get kicked out and cannot reenter you lose a 100 .Eventually you get sick and tired of all this and the game gets boring."

I end up having to close the game and never get to see it, then I go into the next Chapter not really knowing what's going on. The story is important to me and it's very unfortunate that this is happening. A fix from the developers or a suggestion on something I can do would be greatly appreciated.",

I have j3 6 which is pretty bad and still runs well. Very optimized, sleek game. Also alot of updated to keep the game fresh and the microtransactions are very fair.",
        "Very fun game, wish it wasn't energy based, would definitely enjoy it more. The fishing is 'new' right now and i have to say the percentages are garbage. 75 percent is more like 50, 50 percent is like 10 percent,  25 percent is closer to 50. This is just my personal experience. The games is really fun though, expect to get annoyed with the fishing percentages however. Also energy gets spent super fast in this game, very fun yet very limited.",
        "It's good and alot of fun but it's a bit of a tedious grindfest. 150% item find and I found nothing after going through ten dungeons. I want to keep playing but it's just another pay to win type. I understand you need to make money but I can buy a full loadout of epic equipment and run through a great portion of the game in no time. It's definetly worth giving a try but unfortunetly it's not for me.",
        "I fell in love with this game as soon as I opened it the first time. But there is a problem which forces me to give it a 2 star rating. It kicks me out of the game every 5 minutes and that way I can't get any progress done. I absolutely enjoyed the little playtime I got and I want to play it more but it won't let me. Great job otherwise devs!",
        "Fun and amazing game, great time killer for me, I just love these pixelated games so much.. to be fair it sounds like it's more Terraria and pokemon mixed typa thing y'know.. 5 stars",
        "Been playing this for about a week.  It's a lot of fun with a variety of different things to do.  Running out of energy for doing dungeons doesn't matter a lot as there are three or four other things to do in game that don't require energy.  Will be making a purchase to support the devs.  Good game!"

But I just got a new phone and the account was linked to my Google account and I can't access my character, whom of which, I spent a bit of real money on to make VIP 4. I emailed support and they told me what server my character should be on and she's still not there! It keeps prompting me to make a new character.",

Other people in game said they had the same problem and said to fix it, you needed to uninstall it and redownload. Which I did. But now my characters are gone and I have to start off fresh. I've spent money in the game on  building up two characters. And I'm pissed now that it appears its money totally wasted. I feel that this is basically stealing!!",

        "This is one of the best rpgs out there in my opinion for a few reasons the graphics are very nice, rpgs whos graphics try to get really realistic are just not the same it looks blan likr that. My next reason is it isnt a pay to win game. For all of the people out there who like to pay a lot of money, its just dum. Money for a game should only be for cosmetic items to make you look really cool not to boost you 10 tens ahead of everyone, and for that I thank you Allstar gaming. Paying does get you a boost in game its just not very big the only reason rating s are so bad is cuz the top up didnt give them anything which is a huge bug.",

I came acrossed this one from a Facebook add and as soon as I started playying it has been super fun every since. The p2w ratio is literally not high at all. So F2P can definitely gain just ad much. Awesome gameplay good graphics for the game itself overall I definitely recommend this game. ♡",
        "Game sucks! No control in game for cheaters. Devs don't care about the game! Hackers are top ranked over the cash players. No matter how many tickets I opened there is no response. Don't waste your time on this game, unless you wanting g to get away with cheating g.",

Not to mention we payers get harassed in game by free to play players daily! Show some respect to the people who give you a pay check.",

        "WOW. This game has everything! My only complaint is that the \"earning\" free in game currency section (downloading and playing other games to certain level), does not yield in game currency, so do not bother. Just pay for stuff when it goes on sale. But otherwise, WOW! This is like fanfic, sims, empire, battle, idle, all in one! Hpw often do you get an all in one game based off an amazing franchise?? (As of this date, ive been playing for 2 months, spent $10)",
        "I reckon this is the best game in the world!! I am a enormous fan of how to train your dragon, so i reckon you have done an awesome job at making this game. But, the only problem is i don't like the part when it loads and takes forever, and sometimes it doesn't even load and yo have to use wifi and takes up alot of storage on your device. So i sugest decreasing those things or stopping those things.",
        "First everything went out smoothly. Now the assets keeps on redownloading everytime I try to play it. My phone still has 7gb free memory, I also tried following ghe suggestion to clear up some space it still doesn't work. But overall it was awesome. I just hope the issue of redownloading will get fixed asap.",
        "When you complete a level in the currently available adventure, you may spin a wheel. Why do I always get resources? Do I seriously need 18 cards worth of resources, each card worth approximately 1 million fish or wood? Please tweek the chances of getting something else! I don't even mind getting lots of sage fruit at this point... At least it would be useful. Resources aren't really useful when you are filled up on resources.",
        "Love the game. Just wish it gave a little more direction on what and how to do certain things. And wish you didn't have to wait hours sometimes 19 to hatch an egg. But they do give you the option to pay to speed up the process. Also wish that they weren't so stingy with giving ruins/coins to pay for things they ask you to do.",
        "Love it! I downloaded this for my kids who love the movies and TV series, but I've become addicted! I've spent a bit of money over the roughly 6-9 months I've had it, but I haven't minded. The earn free runes has created issues in random phone calls and spam emails, so I don't use that anymore.   I agree with someone else's comment about the Book of Dragons - I found it much easier previously. Also, I've had a red number on mine for weeks and I still can't work out what it's for...I've searched through the book, I'm searching for dragons when I can, and still no idea what it's about.   I keep getting the download new assets but I know that's because my phone is full and I can't delete anything else LOL. I'm looking to upgrade my phone soon so hopefully it will stop that.  Overall, it's definitely a game I'd recommend (and I have). Thanks."

        "I'm not a fan of mobile gaming, but this game is truly something else. I love The Walking Dead, so I gave this a shot, however, after playing Road to Survival (or whatever it's called- it's the TWD game based off of the comics), my expectations were pretty low. This game though, is not Road to Survival; it's so much more. This is how you do a free to play game with microtransactions right. You can buy a lot in this game with money, but you can easily obtain everything on your own, and quite frankly, it's more fun to do that anyways. This game is super addicting and gives me something fun to do when I've got a few minutes. I've been playing it for months, and I don't plan on stopping anytime soon.",
        "Just a suggestion, it'll be SO MUCH MORE AWESOME probably 10 stars for TWD fans if you could do better missions or events that allow us to get better opportunities to farm for TWD character tokens or class tokens, and also more chance for farming or creating weapons instead of the current set up now. Don't quite like the fact that when deals are awesome but they cost a ton! Try lessen the value a little bit and im sure some players dont mind spending (just my opinion). But overall review, its awesome for TWD fans out there!",
        "It's got good action in graphic. Been playing for a 2 years in 10 month's now.Stay human and Survive.  Up dates all the time love it keep them coming Robert Cregman. Thanks for making the Walking  dead show And game. New stuff to do all the time. In wow all these new survivers. There are some loading issues action issues movement issues alot more mission.",
        "Originally gave you 4 stars, but its one of only a couple of mobile games I have never deleted since installing. Constant content coming in, great use of TWD licence! Keep up the great work- seriously from someone who hates most mobile games!",
        "I've been playing for over 2 years. A few more new maps would be nice and stop nerfing our great traits like interrupt and wrestler! Other than that, great game and great community.",
        "Really good strategy game. The thing that lost it the 5th star is that when I started a second game on another device, it won't play ads for free stuff"

        "Played this game for about 2 years.  Used to be great until the terrible ucool made it completely pay to win.  They have unbalanced and just add new heroes for $100 a month, ridiculous.  Terrible company that only cares about money, for your sake, find a different game.",
        "Heroes Charge is one of the better games, and does not require one to spend a lot of money to enjoy it. It has a wide variety of characters to recruit and there are many ways to improve your party's fighting power. This is one to get.",
        "Gameplay is fun and easy to grasp. Only things needed is a minor improvement in graphics and a way to acquire more stamina. Always run out of stamina and end up having to play something else while I wait for stamina to recharge.",
        "Pay to win, fun game until middle stages where it one shots your group unless you pay money to get over powered characters. I can't even progress anymore because the boss one shots me every time.",
        "I have been playing this game for a long time now...going on 3 years. It is still an awesome game. For all the people saying it's P2W you are wrong....flat out wrong. Do not blame the devs for your impatience or inability to see the strategy in the game. This game can be completely F2P if you have patience. I do no blame the devs for wanting to get paid for releasing a quality product. Paying for the little boosts here and there give you an edge but give it a month and then the new characters are available through several different means. Keep up the good work!!!"

I truly can give this 5 stars cause I played it for weeks and have come across the different scenarios in the game. Thank you for your awesome customer service and great game!!!!",
        "Great. But some of the bonus games for golf bucks are not winnable.  For example, long drive gets a longer required result each time you beat it.  I'm currently required to beat 415 yards which I am sure is impossible.  So why bother trying?",
        "Got too allgegro madness. And got stuck with the no face cards. 14 cards is alot to get. In fairway blast the card suits stick until a new none face card comes up, or reshuffles them. I find with this game they dont stick when the next card is turned over. So your run ends. And the run cards you ave accumulated as returned back to one agan.",
        "I have played and enjoyed this game just about every day for a year or more now.  For some reason and somehow, they've sucked the fun out of the game.  It used to be about playing and earning \"golf bucks\" to use for things like re- filling your golf bag with irons, etc.  However now, it's very difficult to \"earn\" those golf bucks, in fact, it's even harder to play the game.  Now you can go through a complete hole without having any cards that you can actually play.  Now it seems that all the game is about is paying for irons, etc., and/or watching advertising videos to obtain clubs.  Like I said, I really used to enjoy this game but now?  I think it's time to uninstall it and move on to something that is actually fun, not frustrating.  I'd rate this game as \"0\" now, if it were possible!!!",
        "It's a fun game!! can keep you very entertained only thing that sucks is if you have it on PC or iOS there are way more features and it's way better than the Android version!!😢 So the side note is for the developers at Big Fish Games....... So I think we've all waited way too long it's time to step it up and come out with a greater Android version at least make it as good as the iOS version!!!!!?????",
        "People will tell you that it's good for your brain or that it's fun, but that really isn't true, especially since it won't even allow you to turn off hints. Immediately after you make a move, you can't even think for yourself and try it alone. It's annoying. Don't get it. Go to a different solitary game."

        "I wrote a review already for my game on my laptop,and as I said I love this game but for some addicting reason I now have a new game on my new tablet I just got hehe. I am not here to complain and I'm not saying anyone else is in just wanted to let you know that some of the ads don't show up on the tablets you can hear them play but can't see them and as I said (some). I have managed my way around it through memorizing where the close (x) is just from trying to tap every corner but I would like not to have to do that hehe. But like I said I can manage, it's just that I know someone who would like to play but can't really stand that lol my mom hehe anyway I just thought about it would be nice if she could play too and it might help as well. Thanks for reading and listening and have yourselves  a nice day and night. Plus thanks for this game!",
        "good game but y'all gotta fix how valuable the gems are. its impossible to get lots of gems without paying and you're only rewarded 1 per video. and then it costs me 150 gems to get TWO hatchery spots? that's bs. fix that and I'll give 5",
        "I love this game because is it active! I can play it all day and not get board! Keep up the great work everyone!😛😛 ( there a lot of ads every 5 minutes though. I don't know why. Pls fix that and the game will be even better! Respond to me as soon as you can! Thanks you for your time to listen to my opinion!",
        "I love this game! So much,very addictive and very unique!  I would rate 100 stars if I could!You can battle, feed dragons, do clans...ECT ! Every update it gets new things!  Best dragon game ever!You would love this game, just get it! And it's free!There are so many islands too! You can connect it on Google play to save the game or Facebook! The dragons are so cute!!! Please get this game! There are so many activities  And tournaments!",
        "I love this game so much but... I used to play this game a year ago then I got tired of it then I returned yesterday  I had a Facebook account that even has a legendary called Ice cream , so I signed in back half of my dragons are gone , my farms , my island everything that's why I rated 1 if I could get my account back I would rate 5 Thanks. Sincerely,  A Google Player ( Facebook too ).",
        "There is an unnecessary amount of ads. I understand representing your sponsors, but at what cost to your customers? General game play is also very challenging for new players  as far as leveling up dragons, collecting coins/food, and even breeding times are ridiculous."

Really fun to play, this is the longest time I've ever played such a game in my phone. Absolutely love it!",
        "this game is good till about 8 hours in where your waiting days to build anything. Gems are really hard to come by so you have to be wary about how much stock u have. And there's no way to dispose of unwanted items in your warehouse (that I know of) but yeah, it's a catchy game",
        "Pretty much a money pit. It's designed to frustrate you into spending money. Everything takes stupid amounts of resources to build or expand. The expansions are tiny. It becomes impossible to fill orders because they all want items you can't make because you cant build anything. Caravans usually ask for ridiculous amount of things and you have no storage room. Everything takes too long to make or regrow so even if you have room, the caravan times out. And the rewards for filling them is measly. It'll still take weeks to get enough to defeat monsters that block expansions. Don't download if youre looking for a fun game.",
        "I liked this game, and have played it for months, until a few days ago when I noticed the \"price\" of buildings required to progress take a huge jump up!! I will gladly support a game I like by making purchases but I'm not about to spend my house payment just to progress IN A GAME!! Not cool, and makes me regret the money Ive spent so far. On to the next!!",

        "Hi! I have been playing bloons td ever since the 1st one came out and I'm still playing btd5 today. I can't wait for btd6 and btd adventure later this year! Also. One suggestion, I feel like a lot of long time players including myself would be much more likely to participate in the random events on maps if they were also doable on mastery mode. Thank You! I look forward to more big things from Ninja Kiwi!",
        "Works good on my Sony Xperia XZs. Only problem is if I'm doing an impoppable track and I'm using Monkey Engineers. On those few levels where a mass of regeneration bloons come in, the game lags like hell. My workaround for that has been to be lame and just get sun gods",
        "Bloons TDs have always been a favorite of mine. But I'm only giving 3 stars because of a technical issue that's mind boggling. I'm on a galaxy note 8, and I start to experience game halting slowdown on level 79. I had played this game on my note 4, and could easily double that before the hardware struggled. Please please fix it",
        "I love this game. It works great on my phone.  My only problem is that I had to reinstall it and I don't know how to get everything back. If you could help that would be great. Also to be totally honest, I'm pretty sure I didn't save it to the cloud or my Facebook account.",
        "Extemely good game for pretty much any age or level of play. Easy to get into and there's enough depth of game that it will take a lot of playing to get bored. Also works well on any platform - I have it on my ipad and Samsung phone. :)",

Logged in with my Facebook account still nothing. Help!!!! Please so I can get back to enjoying this game!"

        "Came back after a long break. I'm enjoying the updates and improvements I'm seeing. The frequency of updates keeps it interesting and there's always something to work towards. They don't make it impossible to score big ticket items like most games just have to strategize correctly and out in time and just about everything is within reach",
        "Game keeps crashing ,having to re stall the game after every update due to bugs in the system. Very disappointed since I got over charge when buying gems on black Friday, no good hurting loyal high level players by over charging them. Would not recommend game to anyone. And when you do asked a question the customer support team threat you with  no support when you keep asking question over issues or when the update coming. I have found they hate when high level player answer back . I would not recommend game to new players.",
        "March 2018 and it still crashes. Server errors with made up numbers and a broken promise that it will not happen again! Since the last update it's becoming impossible to edit the trains without frequent crashes! Also a different error message number every time! I have progressed very well In the game so far but all the fun is being sucked out by the need to constantly restart the game!",
        "This game was great until the last update. That update has ruined the performance of the game. the graphics geet been improved, but the performance has degraded... please release a new version with better performance, or I will uninstall it... 1 week left",
        "Definitely not a fan of the latest update. Graphics have become very choppy in an attempt to be \"sleek\".  Trains take twice as long to reach the station now.  Game crashes a lot more often.  I hope the developers fix these issues soon....or this may be the very update that finally gets me to quit."

I have been wanting a diamond character and now you took it away from me. How can anyone get a diamond level character now. There is no way to purchase them either as they are elite pack exclusive cards. Not very happy. Waiting for this to be fixed until I'm satisfied.",
        "Best game I have played, however after the updates i can't seem to see other game modes like faction wars challenge mode and even quest mode. I have reinstalled a couple of times, I have seen those missing modes in a novice account but whenever I log into my wbaccount they disappear leaving me with normal mode and  the tower mode.",
        "Love the game. Hackers though ruin it, especially in faction wars in hard and fatal battles. For the ones who just updated, faction wars will show up within 12/24 hrs however not sure bout quest mode. Been playing actively for over 2 years, but still don't have All maxed out equipment or all maxed out characters. Hackers have everything maxed out which makes a mockery of our equipment.",
        "I love the game so much, it's fun and gory but I used to play this on my IPhone and I got a new phone and I can't transfer my data even with my Facebook connected to it. My new phone is a galaxy s8 and I wonder if I can transfer my iPhone account to my galaxy. I don't to start over while my other phone have great and exclusive characters. Please help.",
        "I love the game and new update. But i am soo disapointed, that you promissed us Injustice raiden and klassic mileena, still there are no challenges about them. Please make a new challenge a bout those charecters. Also injustice scorpion, undercover cassie cage and others. Please make this right.",
        "Favorite Game This is my all time favorite game. I have an old phone I use just for this game with nothing else on it because it's so big. Even with nothing else, I still have to do a factory reset on my phone to delete everything just to reinstall this game every time they decide to do an update!"

        "Amazing game very addictive...  Love the fact that they have a specials  more often... Also like the events with the second hospitals... Would like if we had special events more often... Just wish we had a platform to save the game my sister had to restart the game 6 times i had to do it twice... Wou be great to save progress on fb or another platform... Even log in  Really frustrating when we lose progress.... I only need 5 more characters then I'll have them all... So if i lose progress again im not starting over  Overall my favorite game on my phone!! Thx",
        "I couldn't get enough patients, I couldn't get enough cash, and my staff energy seemed to drain way too fast. I love the surgery games but you maybe get one of those a day. I ended up uninstalling when room upgrades said they would take 12 hours. Too much waiting, not enough action. I liked the story so far too. Maybe I'll reinstall in the future if the times go down.",
        "Controls don't work properly during surgery! There is lot of lag while performing an action while the timer works properly. Moreover, it doesn't allow me to suture the skin, even if I'm trying to do it right (it worked at the begining). Please fix these bugs or I will uninstal the game...",
        "Love the overall feel of this, though some things need tweeking. For example, I only have half of the staff available and am now getting far too many duplicate cards concidering how many I have left to get. Makes it feel all too much like it's pushing people to spend real money, something that always ends with me deleting the game and moving on. Hope this doesn't happen in this case, but I'm not holding my breath...",
        "It's a nice game, I like the concept, you get to operate on patients and manage a hospital. Problem with the recruitment part, it was always giving me surgeons and wasted 200 hearts on the same person. There should be an option if you want to fire someone or replace with another staff. The biggest issue is with their connectivity, internet connection is very stable works with all apps except for this one, no idea why. Fix it please I would hate to delete this game. Thanks.",
        "This game will cheat you! I  upgraded a bunch of my characters but the next time I logged in nothing had saved! The funds I used to upgrade were also gone, of course. Don't waste money buying anything because the upgrades you make just disappear."

        "I'd really like to give this game a 5 star rating. Their customer service is fantastic. The graphics are great. Lots of missions to go on. And they have events every week. Exactly what I'd be looking for in a star trek game. But the thing I just can't get past is the gambling aspect for role playing. All I want to do is role play as a captain of a galaxy class starship. But after a month of almost daily spins at the Dabo table (including spending real money on the vip pass and dilithium, and rolling multiple times a day) I haven't gotten a single galaxy class schematic. I don't want to play borg, or klingon, or older enterprise (hell, I'd trade all of those for just a generic galaxy class). It doesn't seem fair the game doesn't give you a more direct way to role play as your favorite ship. Isn't that the whole point of a game like this?",
        "Great collections of star trek universe, but the game screams micro transactions and gambling around every corner. The game gives you a great concept that gets hindered by currency gates. Only play if you want a nostalgic taste of star trek themed free to play game",
        "I absolutely love this game! It's concept is (though not entirely unique to Star Trek) cool. I just love the voices for characters and would love more characters to have voices.  For the longest time I was a F2P player, and when Events first started I was constantly in the Top 1000 so don't buy into that \"You have to pay to win\" nonsense. If you do put money into this game make it the $4 Monthly Dilithium Card it is worth it $4 for 3000 Dilithium if you can afford it.",
        "Don't listen to the haters who say it's Pay for Play and DB is a greedy company. It's bull, no amount of money will get you where time invested into the game will. Oh, and if the game even loads slow for a second DB is likely to send free stuff. If people complain about somthing...free stuff. So I say keep up the great work! One thing though, I'd be awesome if we could name our starbases. Just a thought.",
        "Progress stalls unless you spend insulting amounts of money (dilithium prices are absurd) to get better characters. In the early days of the game you could progress easily, but now I feel as more high-paying players have joined they want you to spend money to progress, and their prices really are absurd. The game is fun, but they're greedy. In the events especially, those who pay more get significantly better awards. A bit disappointing for those of us that have supported the game with occasional purchases from the beginning.",
        "Love everythinggg tho id like to like i want to controle the ship my self manuver it myself open world like eh thats my piont this might change the game and other peoples view/perspective pionts but it would complete my dream of getting the one thing i always love and always will love star trek.😁"

        "I feel inlove with the game the second I opened it! being a huge naruto fan I had high expectations! and most of them were met.  I have two issues! it's seems the only way to get hero fragments is through the shops which is only 10 at a time. or special attack missions which keep changing! makes it very hard to awaken shinobi.  also why only 8 chapters in story mode! You have a whole two anime to base off and we only get 8 chapters! how disappointing.",
        "I am a little disappointed in the game right now. I saved up for the Jiriya banner which is supposed to have a higher drop rate, got one Jiriya card in a multi 10xs summon. I would like to know why that happened seeing as with every other banner I have ever pulled on had numerous cards for that shinobi, sometimes even the full kit minus an ult. I am not looking for an ultimate every time. But when I pull on a banner I would like the rate to actually be reasonable thank you very much.",
        "Everything was working just fine until not long ago. All of a sudden, everytime I try to play any kind of mission on my android, a message will pop up saying, 'Due to an unknown error the game will return to the title screen'. It's been happening for over a week now, I've tried to reinstall but nothing works. Please fix.",
        "4 days ago i was having a problem of playing missions. I couldnt start it because the screen showed \"due to an unknown error the game is returning to the title screen\". The issue was resolved yesterday and again today the same old stuff. Is this a joke going on with my account?",
        "To BANDAI NAMCO... Just suggesting a few thought about this game. I've taken liken this game more than any other I played so far.  I just thought during the mission about the choosen characters. I think this game will be more stratigical if you can switch characters during the mission. It just doesn't make any sense if the main character you control died right away. Since in a story there's still a chance to turn the table on your side. Just like in Naruto series though their team captain may die the subordinates will carry their will and a chance to win. And in this game,  If the main character died the rest automatically dies though there's still a lot of spare life. Hope you call consider.  Just making suggestion. Your AWESOME making this game BANDAI NAMCO.",
        "I really like this game, the only reason im giving it a 1 star. Is because I've tried to send them a message involving an issue but I cant seem to find the way to do it. In regards to the issue I hope they see this message and fix it, for some reason it wont let me do any missions. I have updated it and deleted the cache but the problem persist."

Need easier way to earn gold, weapons and gear. But overall excellent game.",

Polished graphics, nice player skills set, awesome UI items layout - everything is top notch! The only thing I can wish for is adding camera turn on top of player strafe via joystick. Thanks for the hard work, and please keep it up!",
        "Finally a mobile mmo that actually feels like a real mmorpg. Nice graphics, skills, open world questing, lots of players. Fights are engaging  and boss fights are spectacular and interactive. You do need a team for dungeons and raids as you can't just 1 shot everything, like in other mobile mmos. I've tried loads but this is the best by far! Keep it up!",
        "Great mobile MMO! Good graphics and narration so the story stays interesting. Additionally...SO much Co-op and PvP and a lot of things to give an edge. Not P2P dominated either so far. Obviously the grind to 55 is tough but I have a few characters on different servers there still very possible.",
        "I think this game is amazing for an MMO mobile. It has a feeling of blade and soul and WOW and the graphics sre amazing on my Razer phone! Actually feels like a real MMO, and I like that there are character voices.  Only problem I am having is whenever I go to turn the Volume up or down all sound cuts out and won't come back on until i restart the game. So I need to pre-set my volume before launching the game and then not touch the volume while playing.",
        "I'm furious.  First you guys fix the Android problem. Now I run thru the update and a screen pops up that I need to relaunch game because it's out of date. How when I literally JUST watched it update? I've spent a lot of time on this game and really like it but if I can't even get to the character select screen, why would I keep it on my phone. It's a shame, it really is.",
        "Could not even start playing. At the start screen the audio is pushing and choppy. This persisted into the game itself, turning off the music did not help, though turning off all sound did. Not playing this type of game without sound. I have a Note 8, so a top of the pine phone, so it's not me running  a phone that can't handle this type of game"

I love the easy gameplay and the graphics, The only problem I have with it is how hard I is to get ninja pearls without money, I'm young and dont have a credit card or job yet so I miss quite a few opportunities. I highly recommend to any Naruto fans.",
        "This game is very great and can be addicting. The only problem u have is that when ever I try to play a mission it always says there is a communication error. I would really like to keep playing the game, so if there is anything you could do about it- that would be great.",
        "your servers are bad.. trying to hunt Chino but 2 times already when we finish the last map and i see the yellow card of the last boss, then i get connection lost and don't get a thing in the end.. it is really frustrating to play for 15 minutes, see your goal fulfilled but then.. nooooo, you don't get the cards in the end",
        "I love the game, but during multi-player, especially in impact missions, let us continue even if player 1 gives up. It's extremely annoying when you play to the boss, and their hp is very low,  and player 1 leaves and all that time was for nothing. Let player 2 and 3 continue, even if player 1 and 3 or 1 and 2 quit, let that last player control the other two. That's the only improvement I can think of for the next update.",
        "I'm only putting it as one star in hopes the devs see this, but please find a better way to recover accounts. I've been a fan of this game for years and when I logged in I was logged out, I have no idea what my transfer info is because I've only had to do that once. I don't want to just start over, please find a better way for people to get their accounts back once your update logs them out.",
        "It's not the best game but because I am a fan of naruto my interest in this game might be different than others would think. Overall its a decent mobile game but it could use some more improvements."

And I may be alone here but I want greater customization of my character. If I had it my way my buffed dude would be buck naked, and boned.   However I had to say had, because I've played one time. All I've ever gotten since is \"connection timed out\" message.",
        "I love this game for it concept and content but it hasnt functioned correctly on any phone ive attempted to play on.  Currently, upon game loading up, i go to start and it says \"connection timed out\" and wont connect to server. And says the same fore every server so I cant play. Would love to be able to play again!",
        "I must admit this is the first LGBT game I've ever played and it's quite entertaining. The male sprites are very manly and attractive. The art illustrations from the bar are really gorgeous, wish there were ways to collect them in a gallery. I love the way we can customize our main character's cosmetics. Aside of appearances, the RPG content, battle mechanics and character development are a nice niche. The chat needs a little improvement and the server connections are unstable; I often get a connection timed-out which is quite an inconvenience. Overall, I really enjoy the gameI'm looking forward to more outfits and new characters released in the future.",
        "Made in-app purchase but item never arrived in game. Contacted developer and issue was never resolved. It's been over a month and I'm still waiting to see results on the issue. The most I've seen is a couple emails and a review reply. If you contact the developer, don't expect any swift responses and definitely don't expect the issue to ever be resolved.",
        "I love the game.  I played with it for 5 days in a row to get Augustin but now i can't pass 71% loading time without crashing.  I noticed when i changed the server from Tender Loving Hall to other servers it works ok again but sadly all gains are lost.  I wish there's a way to retrieve my character.",
        "I've been having the same issues as some other users. It's been working just fine for the past few days, but I tried to play it today and it won't go anywhere past 71%. I would really like to stay on the server I've been on than start all over on a new one."

        "Fantastic game! It's by Gameloft so it's bound to be a good phone game. It's not unfair, but you do have to have some skill. It doesn't hold your hand but it's not hard to learn the controls. Despite the fact that you're also playing against people who are on their computers as well, it's definitely not unfair. One request: maybe add more options for your killstreaks. I would love to have my drone and turret on the same killstreak for my sniper class but I'm stuck with recon instead. Still love it tho :)",
        "Seems like a good game. Has gotten allot of good reviews also. Is ashame I can't play it though. I downloaded it, and when I start it tells me I must download the update files. Which I did, even though that's when MORE DATA USAGE. Now it won't even load past a certain percentage, haven't gotten to play yet, even after DIDN'T TONS if files and data worth of the game.........Pls fix so I can actually try the game. I WILL EDIT THE REVIEW IF I GET TO PLAY",
        "When im playing online and doing some online events i get credit and xp points after the mach and then when i get kicked out and coming back i have lost everything. This is boring and i want you to fix this problem. I cant play online anymore because there's no one's playing but when my friend is playing on he's phone he always find a mach. Please fix those problems",
        "I like the game but only when i actually works!! It doesn't let me change the graphics settings and it's crashing constantly after each game i play. That's frustrating for such a huge title I'm running android 7.0 on a redmi note 4",
        "It's a game where people will get addicted to it after playing it once.. But every time when we are installing app we have to play the untill 1st check point.. Better developers fix this. So after immediately after installing user must go to his account and sync game data..",
        "This game is awesome and addictive. My second First Person Shooter Game After Modern Combat 3: Fallen Nation.  I only wish the Game Developers can bring back the game control we had in Modern Combat 3: Fallen Nation; especially in terms of the gun control, and also create an offline PvP mode using Hotspot and Wi-Fi to connect players. Putting these two features in place will make this game undisputed First Person Shooter Game Ever.  In the near future, we should be considering how one can make real cash while playing online games like this."

This has happened to me several times already and I'm passing thus information on. Please, King Games, investigate this immediately because I enjoy your games and would like to see this resolved. Thank you.",

Why can't I send lives anymore?!  Thank you! For updating the game! I almost uninstalled this game cuz it was taking so long. Hello! Out of levels! Hurry up please! I enjoy the game, but I'm all caught up. I've been trying to up my scores just to have a reason to keep the game on my phone. So far so good. I just started today and I'm enjoying it! Thank you! More recently, I love it! I've been trying to find a game with the quality of King games in this category and no one is a good! Thank you!",
        "Love this game! It's challenging, addictive and beautifully developed both visually and audibly.My complaints would be:   *Certain aspects of the game are not clear, with nowhere to reference. So certain occurrences just seem incidental and therefore don't allow you to fully strategize.   *There are no written rules or explanations to refer to. Additionslly, the game is not customizable. I was just assigned a random avatar (which I don't like) which doesn't appear adjustable.  *It also used my real name to identify in the game, even though I had already created one before registering to King Games. Worse, there seems to be no way to change this either.  If there is a way already developed to address these issues, please help!",

        "Well after playing all the battleships games on Google play store I must to say that his one is the best of all. The game have the best graphics, the best gameplay and one of the most important things in my opinion there is a lot more ships and different types of ships than the other games. So if you enjoy playing games about battleships I recommend you to play this one instead of the others. The only negative thing that I found is the lack of ships in some countries except for Japan and USA, it would be great if they add all ships that are present in the PC version.",
        "Excellent Game overall. Good graphics and controls (once you get used to how a ship moves) feels very real. Gameplay is fair but challenging and is addictive when trying to LVL up. Costs are reasonable but bonus cold be higher for premium account when compared to console prices. Customer service very good. I had a loading issue and advice was prompt and issue is resolved. Would edge about 4.7 out of 5 for me.",
        "Fun game at first and got all the way to a tier V battleship!! It was fun until I started going against OP destroyers. I can broadside that tiny ship two of three times but it doesn't matter. Couple of torps and down I go. They move faster than i can track. Will be going back to Battle of Warships.",
        "The game in general is great but torpedoes are just too powerful. I can't even hit the destroyers with their speed but now with their infinite torpedo supply that always seems to reload faster than my guns I can't even stand a chance? No fun at all. If anything you should follow battlestations Midway and Pacific. They're models completely balanced everything. Torpedoes were powerful there but they took awhile to reload and were finite. Thus you couldn't just spam. If you missed you lost out and had to do it the old fashioned way. Either nerf torpedoes or buff BBs cause otherwise it just isn't fair.",
        "Very well executed port of a good game. Mostly sane monetization. The only problem I see is the premium price. In desktop version it is slightly less than 10$/month which is on the cheap side for MMO and makes a very good proposition. Mobile version is almost 30$/month which is frankly too much. I may consider 10$, or even 15$ per month (same as AAA MMO games on desktop with a ton more content), but not twice the price, especially for a mobile time killer.",
        "Please give us the option to disable Auto Target Tracking in settings.  The auto tracking can cause you to fire at ships your not wanting to target, especially if there lined up side by side. And cause your shots to fall way short or too far if the enemy ship is coming straight towards you. If love to have the ability to disable this feature in the settings."

        "This COULD be a great game, but it's a very much unbalanced. Your resources on you area NEVER grow back, so you must travel... I get why that is, but it takes 10-30 minutes, unless of course you want to use energy. You get 100 energy and it takes too much energy to fast travel at the pace that energy is replenished. If you can get around that, and build a few items, tools, weapons, etc. It seems like the game finally gets going but if you die from the 5-10 attackers, you lose ALL of your stuff on you. Everything I've mentioned can of course be fixed by spending a TON of money, but beware, everything has durabilty, and once broken will disappear. So you will always be spending money. CAN'T THERE BE ONE OF THESE GAMES THAT AREN'T MADE OUT OF COMPLETE GREED?",
        "Great game, wish there was something to gain more energy, and a hp, or energy lvl cap off, max hp should go up like 2hp per lvl gained. Idk more stats that the player can tweak for gameplay",
        "I really like it, but such a slow start, after the initial offering of goodies i just stumble along with constant death, no weapon, lose my bag every death. Very frustrating.",
        "New update turns game very very hard and unbalanced. To much equipment cost for too little kill reward",
        "The team solved all my issues. Beautiful game, new twist on an already good concept. Loving it! Can't stop! Addicted!",
        "I still like the formula (except for the energy, I want to play not wait), but... If you're just going to clone Last Day, you could at least include the character customization and female model. We waited forever for that in LDoE to the point where I quit playing it as Generic Dude and never really got to enjoy it as I would've preferred playing my own gender. Trying to call it an RPG when you have zero customization. While I absolutely love that there's no stupid 24hr horde breaking walls like in LDoE, the Night Guest is also annoying, fast and without warning. The game balancing is a little on the tough side, and if you're going to keep it that way, you could at least make the AI stop camping the border where we ran out of a zone. The spawning-in AI that beeline chases you down happens too frequently, and some enemies keep camping the area if you run to the border. Makes it tough when they're hitting you the moment you try to return. Also, AI \"players\" spawning and 1-2shotting me out of nowhere with a bastard sword? I'd love new content, but game needs balancing."

I played this game with a lot of people.  It was my favorite ga   me.  Want to play again!!!!                            It now works but you started me over and took all my life's I had saved up.  I was on level 700.  I used to really like this game and played it every day.  I hope I don't have to delete this game because I am not starting over!  Put me back where I was with my life's!",
        "Fun BUT SUPER GLITCHY! It will close itself out causing you to lose progress and rewards. It will also occasionally restart your phone. When you ask for help they will always 1st ask \"is this the most updated edition\", even if you already told them you game is on automatic update. Its a good game, just frustrating to deal with",
        "I love the game but how can I go from level 146-148(can't remember exactly level) to 1900. I don't understand. Can you please fix this issue. Thanks.",

        "I do miss the old LOA - Fire Raider style of art and play, just came back after maybe a year or so and it was gone! But, Paradise seems pretty cool so far, only thing I'm not a big fan of is how everything deals with irl money while in the 'old' one you could build up gems or materials for certain things like VIP levels; also I heard about rewards being given to old players like me? That's pretty cool, will have to check that out... But yea, so far I like the game, miss the old style but it's still good to me, will update this later on when I play more.",

        "Only challenging for nonpaying playing. Not a big fan of pay to win games. But LoA is always addicting and just makes you want to spend your money. Not suitable if you're addicted to that overall. More nonpaying support would be reasonable for them to at least be able to compete.",
        "Latest updates just added more to this already enjoyable game.  However I wouldn't encourage new players to spend any money on the game as the benefits are nonexistant for what you pay. Which means a limited lifespan for the game if no one is paying.  Still a good game to enjoy on a mobile device.",

        "The game has bugged out now the hero's that did the time challenges are stuck I cant get them back.  I think it happend when the anniversary update hit and I put them in a time challenges during the time.  When I prestige and go to the time challenges it goes straight back to the main menu. And when i do have hero's  in the adventure mode it cuts to them when I pick the time challenges.  Please fix this.  And also happy anniversary 😀   Problem was fixed thank you very much!😊",
        "The game is fine but like all mobile games or eventually gets to the point where it's purely about you parting with money to proceed. That being said even tho this game uses ads for it's reward system it's actually quite pleasant, at no point did it become ridiculous or over the top. I really do appreciate how much of a back seat it it feels like the adds are taking to gameplay.",
        "Almost A Hero is an incredibly fun game with lots of interesting heros to use to battle near endless hordes of baddies. I find myself loading up the game multiple times a day to grab the free chest as well as to push through another couple waves before my next prestige. I highly recommend this to anyone interested in this genre!",

I watched almost any that were presented to me in order to get farther faster but now they literally always load up a few seconds, then the game like restarts and I get jack from it. Dudes! Please fix, I am so very rarely addicted to a game like I am/was with this!!  Literally the best clicker/idle game I've ever played. I was glued to my phone for all of my free time five days straight because new and awesome stuff kept getting unlocked."

        "I love all the Is-it Love stories, they're fun and a great distraction. My only complaint is that there isn't enough free daily energy! You only get a teensy bit of the story every day, which is maddening. There should be loads more ways to earn energy, especially like the mini games.",
        "Matt seems like kind of an asshat in Season 2. She should just dump him. Could do way better. Like with Daryl perhaps? He obviously cares for her wayyy more than Matt does. Matt only has eyes for Lana. Like he says he loves our girl? I don't think so. I wish you could choose somebody else to date.",
        "Energy is too short & there isn't anything other than a side game for 100 more points to keep you entertained. The app is basically a story with a couple of nice artistic pictures.  Way over priced. You can buy a book for less at Barnes and Nobles and still get twice the amount in content. The the amount of money they ask for engery in this game is ridiculous. Don't be silly  and spend money that you can do better with. Just play for free or not at all.",
        "I think it's a good game but... Let's be fair you don't get to play for long each day before you run out of energy and have to wait 24 hours and even then it's only a few minutes play.... The lack of play time makes me loose all interest in what I believe might be a decent game",
        "So. This is an addictive store. The main characters are very well thought out. A few Grammer error and hick ups in game play. Although this game can be expensive if you don't make the right choice. I had bought the same secret scene twice and it still asks me to buy it. This is the second time this has happened. All in all great game.",
        "I find it aggravating that your energy goes down so fast. You get a few seconds of free play per day. I've paid to get more. But I can't and won't keep doing that when even paying for extra doesn't last long. 😒"

The for sale paper needs to update quicker.  Also, it's very hard to accumulate any 'west bucks' in this game and you need them to do almost anything, so the game is a big money suck too. I'm deleting it.",
        "I love these type of games just like hayday. I have noticed it freezes and takes ages to load the newspaper. Also would be helpful if it could tell you who needs help in the newspaper would help filling orders quicker. Also I have noticed alot of people selling the same parts and harder to get others and it's extremely rare to get the land parts without paying",
        "The game doesnt give enough case vs things to buy or fix.  Also have issues with getting product into the alloted spaces.  I thought it was my screen but had it cleaned thoroughly and it still happens.  It takes several attempts!!!  The story is cute.  The graphics are cute as well.  Ive noticed it has a couple of choices from other games Ive played on older phones. I would suggest the game to others but get the issues fixed and itll be a 5star game.",
        "I love playing these games. I'm not sure why we are rating gameplay they offer apps not a game. It's crazy how they ask us to rate game at the beginning of game. We haven't learned the bad points. This game makes us pay for treasure chest instead of giving us to them free like most games. Which means we have to pay for everything. Totally not fair. Takes the fun out of game.",
        "The game itself is fabulous. Cute farm. Good graphics. Good work on that front. Yet being a bit more generous with westbucks in game or making some things more payable with your coins. I get that games don't create themself. But I personally am more likely to pay for games you can actually play for a bit after doing a purchase. And I don't really get that feeling here. But none the less the game itself is a work of art 😊"

After several attempts if at all the server menu loads, the game kicks me out when I try to login my account. I tried repairing the game many times, reinstalled it too many times, but the same problem persists. Hope your team will look into the matter soon. Thank you!",

Reinstalled dozen times and Repaired using there repair icon on start menu (because of always server busy). Game always updates especially on patches .. Spent more time on fixing the game to make it work than playing it. And ..l.. for your latest update. Btw. My phone is s8+. And got decent internet connection."

        "Starting my second character. Look to all you perfect people out there who never do anything wrong and have it all figured out. This game isn't perfect but have to say that it's the only one I can think of that I have played for more than a year straight and have now started a second! Even my Wife started playing her own character and that is saying everything if you new her. P.S. Good luck if you are ever unfortunate enough to meet me on the field of battle.",
        "The game itself is good fun, but it's ruined by anything but normal missions can't be completed without buying gold from the Gree store, the most frustrating thing is the constant crashes. I am running a completely up to date, vanilla Pixel2 and a 25mbps network and it will crash almost every time, no amount of updates to the game over the past 3 or more years, or my multiple platforms, has changed this. There is massive lag everytime you conduct an action, or change screens. Please, please make it more quick & stable!",
        "Gree support sucks. They don't typically solve problems, or even provide appropriate responses to questions. Tapjoy doesn't pay out gold offers and isn't held accountable by Gree to stand by their offers. Game has come down hill over the years.",
        "Game was good when was under the hands of Funzio.unfortunately ever since Gree takeover, there had been nothing but glitches, dishonest scrupulous non-ethical in-game strategies to trick players of their progress and money. I wouldn't advise players to continue spending or start playing this game",
        "Very slow, lags, when you tap on anything, attack, raid, change base, deploy units, buy units.  Just takes forever. That's on Android phone, and on iPad 2, takes 5 mins to start, then will just crash, used to work sometimes.  I have been playing for a few years, and it just gets worse.  Otherwise would be good, but if you spend money on gold, it should work.",
        "Gree either just doesn't care about the customers that play this game,  or they have  hired a bunch of bumbling idiots. Always have the same mistakes and problems every time anything is changed, new campaigns, etc. Hard to advance if you don't spend real money, but why spend money on a game with such a crappy team running it?? Don't waste your time unless your goal is aggrivation and frustration."

I've restarted my phone, uninstalled and installed and nothing. It just sits on the opening screen, sadly I will have to delete. Wish I didn't have to but it's just wasting space on my phone now. Otherwise, I did enjoy it.",
        "Its completely pay to play. You have to use diamonds to expand your land, but you can't earn them. You have to buy them with real money. It would be a problem if you could buy a small amount for like $0.99... But the minimum is $10 Its ridiculous.",
        "I would love the game,if there was really something to do, no interaction,from what I've read this is a useless app.i got on after the update today,and my screen is blank except for my buildings,the scenery is gone,black! I am on a mobile and can't use any of the great functions everyone talks about. I can't even help my team,totally disappointed,that's for sure. And I've spent quite a bit of money. I am so bored.Theres only a couple things to enjoy on it.Come on ,why can't you get this game together for Android users?",
        "Playing on the phone app. I am disappointed that I cannot play the full version. I cannot send messages to my fellowship members, I cannot see their cities, I cannot participate in the events with my teammates. All I am doing all day every day is trying to build up resources for upgrades, and those are high compared with how much you can make. You cannot earm free diamonds, and many of the buildings you cannot get without them. Will rate higher when these things are improved.",
        "The game is beautiful, but its a bit to complicated. And the in app purchases are rediculus. I'd love it if you could actually advance in the games. There are just too many things needed to advance in the slightest. It's too bad cuz the game it has great graphics.",
        "Game is great. Love building games. Only letdown is that is pay-to-win. It would be better if non-paying players would have little more easy time with game, like give more builders at least... 😉"

        "I liked the game so much. No! I love it, but it's just that I'm now on level 65 but I'm stucked since I only have few gems left and I needed to extend the time, and buy some customers which I find amazing just to save your energy and the stage but I also find it hard since I have already completed 3 stars from lower levels and why is it that I can't play the levels I have already completed? I would really suggest that lower levels would still be played just to be able to collect gems. I hope you can fix this issue though. I'm so loving this game and I'm getting addicted to it. I got stucked on level 65 on my two days of playing. Thank you",
        "Moving on is hard on some levels because they are specifically designed for you to use gems and they are hard to come by. However, If you are patient enough you can eventually earn them. I enjoy that you don't have to drag the items to the customers. It's definitely an enjoyable and challenging game. I'm currently at a \"coming soon\" stage where I can no longer move ahead. I've been waiting a long time and do not want to wait forever. Please do an update soon!!!",
        "I love this game! So few games actually suck me in, but this game had me addicted right away. I play on my phone and laptop. Yes I have two different games at different levels lol. I love how upgrades are so easy and it isn't impossible to upgrade or move on. It gets challenging as you go up levels but it's so fun.",
        "Great game but some levels really hard I cant pasd this one level im on for days maybe update make it easier pass level I'm on I just did update...I hope so... love game anyways great game to.. identical cooking joy to map was a great game to but also hard get passed certain levels that game to n I can try play fast with my hands to still cant pass to not playing  cooking joy anymore going stick with this one see if game gets easier to",
        "It's fun till you run out of energy. They get you too rate the game right away while you are having fun with free lives. Give you enough lives to rate it good then the lives end and you have to watch a min advert or 30 mins for one life Regen. OR PAY. They just want your money at that point. So sad.",
        "Brilliant little time waster of a game.. yet.. once you start getting to the higher levels.. the less chance of earning gems and i aint noway paying for them.. last time I stupidly paid for gems on cooking fever..and got my account hacked into! Big lesson learnt! I do still play this alot tho so overall, definitely a good game. 👍"

You will enjoy this one much more!",

        "Great disappointment, when I heard that this game would come I expected something epic like heroes of might and magic V. Not this generic game that looks like all other games in the play store.",

Spirit Rest runs rely on speed and now it seems after 10-15 minutes (of inactivity, in an idle game) the game becomes unresponsive until you force close and restart, potentially losing what progress you had made. I know this is an implementation to stop bots but it has only made the game more cumbersome than ever before for living players. Please reverse this Ekkorr! Surely you can find some other way to combat bots without placing such a heavy burden on the rest of us.",

        "Sometimes it's fun and most of the time will really piss you off. Like as soon as you log in someone has already got 20 kills. Or you get matched up with people that are at a much higher level. It can be very frustrating,  my guess is that there trying to get you to spend lots of money.",
        "I think this game is awesom.. sometimes I get in a shootout and I'm taken out before I can get a shot, that just makes me want to shoot better.. but most the time I'm battling it out till the till the time play stops, then I get to view everyone's score on both teams and see what rank did what.. Not only is this game  challenging and exciting,  but NO ADS.  5 stars from me",
        "Sometimes opponents do not die even after hitting 10-12 headshots.. quiet unfair check on that.. I would give you 5 stars",
        "Everytime I'm on this game I can't put down the phone. I have to charge my phone or I get disconnected by the Wi-Fi Z",
        "Great way to kill time. Not loaded with ads. Easy to earn upgrades. Really fun game. Was fun then came all the useless changes. Points. Cups. Penalties. It is a punishment to build a squad from the ground up these days",
        "Seen advertisement to this few times thought I'd give it a look & I'm not very good at these type of apps but this is certainly worth a try the team element gives it more of an edge definitely recommend those wanting a sniper challenge to download!"

Graphics are good. Controls are good. Story is great! Loving most of this game so far. I just hope they change the energy part of it. Though I guess it's a lot easier to read thn most episode stories.",
        "I love the story Line just like I've been reading in the comments the energy sucks I know it's just to keep us from reading the story so fast an to blow our money on, but if there was another way instead of us waiting for so long for just a little energy it's defently keeping me from downloading another game like this.. it takes so long to receive the 300 energy I done forgot an really not into the story Like I was when I 1st downloaded it.",
        "The story and art art great, like in the other game, and I love the music too.  I have 2 major complaints though: 1. It's not indicated anywhere in the appstore that this is a work in progress (there's currently 4 chapters in English). This particularly bothers me since I bought energy so I could get immersed in the story, only to be torn out of that immersion by an incomplete story. 2. The energy system. I mentioned this in my review for the Drogo one as well, and plenty of people pointed it out here so I won't go into detail.",
        "I think all of these Is it love stories are absolutely amazing. The writing has given me inspiration to read more romance novels. But I don't like the energy system. I foolishly paid a lot of money to read/play longer and I'm glad the author and developers get the money for a product I thoroughly enjoy. I just wish the daily energy was 1000 or something",
        "Amazing story... When will there be more chapters?! I also don't like how I have to buy energy in order to not just have five minutes (maybe) of reading the story and making decisions. Please come out with more chapters soon!",
        "Loving the story so far and the graphics.. It's all so beautiful. Only wish that they would give you more energy over time to read it.. when you lose time to read you lose interest in the story by the waiting. Help us stay interested!"

        "Extremely addictive! First day I played I overshot my bus stop by 5 minutes because I forgot to look up.  There is always something to do in the game somewhere - and the micro transaction bit doesn't feel forced, and you can easily progress without it.  It kept me occupied for days - unfortunately I had to delete it because I got too caught up.  So if you're looking for a game to grab your attention and keep you entertained on long commutes and the like, this is great for that",
        "Fun little game, but I would love for food, and water, to be a little bit faster. Also maybe rise up the rush chances. I do have 1 suggestion, maybe when the people off to the Waste Lands, they can find some rare stuff, like gems or maybe clothes/weapons. This game is really fun, even though I've just started it, keep up the great work! 👍🏽",
        "I figured my old ass phone wouldnt run this game when first announced, just confirming for folks it sure doesnt. I thought there might be a chance it would cos my phone is rooted and I have full control over how my ram is utilized. Thank bob for android emulators on desktop, can't wait to play :)",
        "Look, I can kind of understand dwellers not dropping their assignments to fight raiders, but can we have the ability to assign fighters to the raiders themselves. It's a massive and unnecessary pain to constantly remind my few armed dwellers to actually fight the raiders instead of just looking cute in the room they just left. Weapons are scarce in this game, and raiders move too often to play pass the gun. It would also be nice if there was a pause feature, but that would reduce the butler-bot purchases.",
        "Fantastic! A resource management sim that is incredibly fresh and charming thanks to the richness of the Fallout franchise. Keeps you coming back for hours. From the quirkiness of the dwellers to the depth of the side quest system, this game is deserving of your time. Finally, the game is totally playable without paying. Still, throw the devs a few bucks! You'll sink hours into this title.",
        "Absolutely love this game. If you're a die hard fallout fan, or even someone new to the series this is the perfect game for you. You'll get a sense of nostalgia pulling your first legendary dweller, or a sigh of relief when you obtain that last part for the weapon you've been looking to craft. Fallout Shelter is the perfect mobile game for any fan of the series. The game is slow and hard in the beginning but when you get on your feet you'll never want to put it down. If you're on the edge about downloading it please do, it's worth all the time and space!"

I find it hard to stop playing once I start. This is one app that you're going to want to download if you want to have some fun.",
        "I use to enjoy playing this game.  Lately though, there are less power ups to achieve and more of the movie tickets.  I would rather have the power ups than the tickets.  This is why I am changing the rating I previously gave of 5 stars to 3.  Also, you should really have more of the Glenda versus the Wicked Witch challenges.",
        "Great game but I really wish that daily rewards are better. It used to be you would get a crystal ball often, money and other things that to help with game, but lately it has been stuoid little rewards like two coins or one row clear. What happened to good rewards for players that come on every day and expect to get a little help in the game play",
        "I love this game except for ONE big aggravation.   When you win extended life you don't get to choose when to use it.  It starts immediately and sometimes you've been playing to complete a sprint or another section and you CANT play another two hours.   That means you lose that extra time.   Today I've lost a 3 hour extra play and now I'm about to lose another 2 hour play.   Very Annoying!"

        "The good:  Better than WB1 where the same words kept showing up throughout even at difficult levels.  It's also nice that it shows your previous progress in a puzzle after you're forced to clear/restart it.  And although you'll still see lots of words that aren't part of the answer, the puzzles are themed so you can ignore those non-answers.  The bad:  The ads are very loud and you can't always silence them before they play.  It does not remember your sound choice so don't even think about playing this in the library.  Also, the game now has a ridiculous background that obfuscates the answer boxes making the game almost unplayable.  Finally, there are way too many boringly easy puzzles that you have to go through before you get to see the fun ones.  I almost uninstalled before getting there.",

        "Where's the 720 potbucks?!  Liars.  Pot farm brought me here.  Need more sexy babes.  A first person shooter mode too, like halo 1 online. Just nother point n click, like bleach online mmorpg.  The game that has all sexy babes no dudes, and the chicks beat dudes and practice femdom, we probably get the highest ratings and be the most popular lol.",
        "This is not the game i watched a video for. I would like to play that game (if it exists) but the link brought me this steamer. I'm sure your well aware of this as you've had plenty of reviews saying as much so its obvious to me you dont care. Great way to build a loyal customer base",
        "The game was fun for a little while, but it becomes quite monotonous. The game isn't interactive enough to keep you coming back for more. You more or less just watch your heroes battle which takes a lot of possible fun out of the game right away. If you spend any cash at all on the game, you unlock the ability to \"raid\" your already completed missions. So then when you need items, you will just mash the raid button until your energy is gone. And the energy recharges VERY slowly. You can play for free, but will progress substantially slower than the pay-to-play player. So overall, it's fun for a short while (a week or two), but you will quickly grow tired of it due to poor interactivity. If you are looking for a game similar to this that will keep your interest and has much more to offer, I would recommend Summoners War.",
        "Game apparently 'malfunctioned' and the heroic chest kept saying open free.  This was after I spent $25 US dollars so of course I thought why wouldn't I get some free opens?  I didn't know they were charging me 200 emeralds a pop.  Customer service was NO help.  Hopefully I can get a refund from Google Play.  Don't download!  Bad programming, scam in game purchases!",
        "While the game seems nice enough, it is nothing like the advertisement I watched. Complete misrepresentation gets one star."

Crates/actives should be tradable 2useless for 1 you want...late game you end up with tons of useless ones and 0 of those you use. Magnet should be an upgrade(like boss dmg and shield mitigation)...chasing bloops late game is a nuinsance.",
        "This game was awesome until i loaded it up and noticed that ALL MY PROGRESS WAS GONE!!! I ALMOST HAD AN EPIC DART THROWER!!!!!!! When i tried to get my progress back using Facebook/Google Play. It was gone too. Please fix.",
        "The game is surprising addicting and offers plenty of content! The progression is decent so far and I really liked the idea of the endeless game modes with leaderboards that reward you! My only gripes about it so far are:  - doesn't support 18:9 aspect ratio - the rewards for the endless game modes could use a boost imo - Only offers one control scheme (there's a game called skyforce: reloaded that offers a manual control setting, essentially the player doesn't follow the finger and the whole screen becomes a joystick, this helps with the game's clarity)   Great casual game otherwise, would recommend giving it a shot 🙂",
        "Great Game. Can't see anything wrong with it. Totally recommend not just ninja kiwi fans but everyone! Thoroughly enjoyed it",
        "I must say that this is better than the older one. However, in TD5, players can buy forever constant upgrades, such as the X2 money and the double village boost area. I recommend that augmentation is needed. It likes amulets and rings in RPG games. For example, a pair of boots that increases firing rate.  I hope my recommendation is not too difficult for skillful developers like you guys.",
        "As a fan of Ninja kiwis work with Bloons series and Sas this will be inherintly biased a minor amount. Now that's my disclaimer.  To anyone thinking about purchasing the game I would say go for it as the price is low (When I bought it), the gameplay is fun and lots of customisation, the graphics could be touched a small bit on but that's me being picky also I would suggest them having faster moving speed for the supermonkey and it feels a small bit slow.  The game is fun and my criticism with the graphics and the movement speed of the monkey should be either disregarded or taken with a grain of salt it does not ruin the gameplay in any way, shape or form."

The main negative is it's completely fixed to try and lure you to purchase better cards and upgrades. You can win 8 games in a row then you lose them, it's about that number every time, coincendence? I think not. it's very hard to even get to castle 6 and we've been trying for about a month.",

        "1.The player with the highest data speed wins the war. 2.I wish  mana can be looted from opponents. 3.I wish there is a clan war. 4.Some epic cards are too expensive that they can never be owned by poor players.  Just a point of view.",

Many other missions. Mount system. Many martial arts. Pets. Marraige system. Guilds. Many shops. Nice vanaties. Multiple classes. Definitely a must download. Best of all progression may take time but does not require top up.  Edit: please fix keyboard. Barely works since update.",
        "Great game over time, fast paced so you should have the best device and connection, the game provides most features others don't.. its almost perfect, spend most money and you will be at the top rank, the game is mostly fighting, nothing else.. just fight fight and fight. After the server merge recently, the game usually gives yellow ping.. so.. thats just about it.",

It comes up with an updater error code 121 and wont even try to load. Please fix this as im sure this is a great gane and i would relish the opportunity to play it!!",
        "After latest update it will not install update, comes up wiith ERROR, forums are also offline as well cannot access them anymore. I miss playing this game and now it just wont install the update. and yes my device is now FULL and the last time it update it deleted old info to make more space, Ive already uninstalled 8 different apps to make room and it STILL wont install",

        "Challenging game against live players. Lots of contests and bonuses. Levels of play from beginner to world class. One drawback: all levels are open entry, so more experienced (and less ethical) players will enter into Beginner to collect quick victories. The designers should change the game so that once a badge is completed, players should not be able to enter games on that level again. This would be fair play for beginners, encouraging them to continue playing. Hope this is implemented in an update.",
        "Game graphics and play are great. However dice rolls are seriously flawed. Doubles way too often. Not even close to real rolling. I've seen 2 sets of doubles in way to many starts of the game. If doubles are so common why don't you ever see 3 doubles in a row to start. Don't ever leave a piece open because the next roll will knock you almost every time. The developer obviously likes frustration proven by the childish limited chat emojis.",
        "They need to fix the dice roll. Its absolutely a big cheat...no way can some roll exactly what they need to get out of a tight position that often. Its really horrible it ruins the whole game.",
        "I think it's safe to say based on the dice timing, that this game app, like all the rest, is favoring a particular player in order to end the game quicker. The auto play is annoying and not possible to turn off.. but the layout is nice.",
        "It's the worst game i have ever played , they are thieves , when you double and you lose they deduct twice the bet and when u win they only give you 45 percent of ur total winning money.I played a game and won 255 thousand , but they only gave me 120 thousand , and when i lost they took out 255 thousand from my money.If you dont believe me count ur chips and see.They suck so go to hell with this lame unfair idiot game.",
        "The dice rolling is not random at all !  It gives ridiculously lucky dices and game over in 3 or 4 turns. Do not play it. NO RANDOM DICE, NO FUN AT ALL !!!"

        "Can't win.. sure they give nice daily bonus credits. But the machines are tight won't let you win and after you lose conveniently a pop up to purchase from their site.",
        "Am frustrated can not log in it just says goldfish has stopped have not gotten a chance to get my daily bonus so may be pushed back to day 1 sent 4 reports and not 1 was answered ughhh pls get back to me someone thank you",
        "The ruby slots should be our choice I never get the one I like. Otherwise this is my favorite slot casino",
        "Very  realistic free casino game.  Most slots match brick and mortar casino slots exactly.  Realistic pay outs as well. Perfect app for wasting a little time at work!!",
        "On December 9 2016 I purchased a Christmas pack for $4.99 didn't receive coins. About 10 minutes ago played fish food game got all cans went to gold turtles got the 200,000 because i bet the minimum of 14,000 and the total was 796,000 in coins made the. big win sound but didn't pay me my coins.

        "Hey... I would give this game 5 stars but there is 1 main -VE POINT. FUEL takes TOOOOOOOO LONG TO RECHARGE.  The point of this game is to playyyyyy the game. I don't want to keep waiting. I downloaded your great game TO PLAY it. Please try to solve this issue. I will definitely give you 5 stars if you fix this. Please listen to us and read our comments. Most of us are mentioning this 1 -ve point. Thank you",
        "Great game but seriously?  The feul tho.  It takes 30 minutes to charge and it's only 5 as the limit.  Cmon that's bad!  I love this game and it has great graphics and it's a great time killer but please make the fuel like to 10 or make it 10 minutes to recharge.  If so I'll rate 5 star$",
        "This game deserves to be the best game of the year. Its so simple and yet mesmerizing. It is also very fast so you won't get frustrated and could play this game for hours (or until the fuel runs out :-P). This game is quite exciting and the visuals are also nice. This game deserves more than 5 stars. The music blends in quite well and jobs make it more fun. Their are many sources from which you can get rewards which makes it easy and challenging to play. I love this game. Also you can buy more fuel slots in the shop for 100 diamonds. Its expensive but I don't need it beacuse I have to keep track of the time and only play until the fuel runs out.",
        "Really good idea let down massively by the developers. Progress is extremely slow due to fuel taking so long to recharge and having to use gems to buy new vehicles. So unless you want to spend all your money on a free game, it doesn't really feel like you're getting anywhere.",
        "Not too bad. I would have like to see the car while playing, and the graphics could be a touch better. I would honestly like an option between dragging your finger and using buttons on either side of the screen. That alone would have given this a 5-star rating from me",
        "It shouldn't be easier to level up rather than actually playing game. I wouldn't say that the gameplay is difficult to play, but the purposefully placed trucks that shoot you is a bit ridiculous. Other cars are in the way which ultimately eliminates you before you can attack the shooting trucks. There really is no challenge except trying to beat your previous score. I give this game an eh out eh."

All of a sudden however you guys have decided to restrict those hourly gifts to 200,000! How are we supposed to play these games when most of these slots by default are asking us to bet several hundred thousand credits at a time? And yes, I do buy coin packs on rare occasions, but I shouldn't have to just to play this game! 😒",
        "It is a great apps and the games are amazing. I've reached level 241 and won big amount of credits.. however I just found out i could not go back to the pain page and keeps saying that is on downlaoding assets. Can anyone tell me what can i do to...?",
        "Loved this game but seems like product madness is very money hungry. You guys have to remember your just a game not a real casino. Lighten up on your wins and bonuses and maybe ill give you a try again.",
        "I found this slot app great to play just like the real thing . my only complaint would be need more coins on hourly bonus cause with most machines there's not even enough coins to have one bet. Thanks guys job well done.",

        "I think it is a great game and great concept. Then in the stories characters would send pictures and videos. Great except you have to pay to see them. Not pay and boom you see stuff permanently, but its a weekly, monthly, or yearly thing like its a PlayStation plus account. There are ways of making money without doing this, its called advertisements. Yea they are annoying but they work. I would rather deal with ads and experience the full game then have the game be free but I have to pay for parts locked behind a pay wall. Aside from that the game is great.",
        "Well the reason I put a zero on the graphics was bc I didn't get to see them.😢 I just wanted to let you know that I want to request a update on the game maybe just like let people see the video chats and not the pictures. It was really hard knowing what it was talking about. Overall I like it!😀",
        "Most stories are good but its Very very very pay to read. With weekly and yearly subscriptions. After reading every story in 1 day, i canceled my free trial and uninstalled. I refuse to pay 3 dollars a week. Or even 50 a year to just sit and wait for them to come up with more material. On top of the subscription cost they ALSO have gems you buy and spend on making the fun choices in the stories. So my advice it to start your free trial, cancel it, read every story in a day. And then uninstall and thank me for not spending money to wait weeks for one more story.",
        "I love these stories because they're  breathe taking, mysterious, juicy, horrifying, gruesome and just amazing. I find clifhanger inspiring because it gives me bazaar ideas for when I want to write a horra story. However, I don't like the idea of paying because when I first downloaded this app I read the first story and while I was reading the story a blurred picture appeared so I was so excited but when I went to click on it, it said I hat to pay which was quite disappointing but other then that I feel like this app was a realy good idea I feel like it was well made well organised and well planned",
        "I understand this would be good entertainment for some, but honestly the set up you have is bad. having to pay multiple time to see a video or anything that is added as an extra is bad enough, having wait time are worse. On top of all of it the stories are lack luster. Please fix it.",
        "I love the app it's amazing. I advise u to download it but pls put ads bc u have to wait 14 mins I mean I'd rather watch ads than wait 14mins it just makes me angry."

        "Played the game for 4years, Its kinda repetitive and boring, you add updates but its too bland and its becoming a pay2win game, honestly I have lots of riches in the game, what can I say I cant use it in real life at all, which is expected, perhaps im sick to the environment of this game, all the saltiness..",

        "Not really easy to understand how to get started playing the game. I had to figure out a lot of it for myself but having to do that got frustrating so after a few days I just decided to uninstall it. It presents as cute and entertaining but trying to learn a game with minimal instruction doesn't give a great first impression",
        "This is one of my favorite mobile games. My only issue recently is I spent money on coins after a level to finally finish it but the game crashed and I ended up having to start the game over smh it keeps crashing but this is the first time it crashed without fixing itself...hope you guys do something about that",
        "Update: I read where you stated\" Our developers only release levels after they personally ensure that levels  are beatable without the use of purchase's\".  I was wondering, do they play a level for a week like I am so far trying to complete it? Are they really playing or it's what the computer tells them? I doubt that any of you are actually playing this game.",
        "I have played this game for months and it was fantastic until the last 2 updates. After those the levels became so hard it's impossible to beat them without spending money. If you enjoy playing the same level for weeks at a time then by all means download. Otherwise don't waste your time unless you want to spend money.",
        "Fun game but today while I have been playing, when I hit give up it keeps going to the 25 coins for 5 more moves no matter how many times I hit it. I have had to exit the app and reopen it to play the level again without spending coins. I hope this is just a glitch and not trying to get people to spend more money.",
        "I love this game however, it has taken multiple lives from me for no reason. The game starts you off with 5 lives & then I accrued 10 lives from winning multiple lives from extra spins. All of a sudden the lives just disappeared and I was reduced to just 5 lives again. This is the 2nd time this happened to me which sucks cause the game is fun as hell."

We battle to take the lead and to see who has the most chips! It's a fun and exciting way to keep in touch with her. Thanks for this game/app!!  Sincerely,  Long distance daughter & Mother 🤓",
        "Fast paced game and love it! Chances to keep getting extra coins and bingo credits by watching the short video or I found out by playing lower levels you had completed to play them again to get more of what you need! The higher levels you go you need more bingo credits so this works to your advantage! Great game and love it!",
        "I really like this game as you get plenty of credits to play and alot of games to choose from. The only thing i didnt like was that i was in the middle of playing a bingo game and i lost internet connection and i didnt get my credits back from that. Other games on other sites if something happens when you are playing a game such as getting a phone call or losing connection you will get your credits all back for that game.  I just wish there was that option on here",
        "never gives your bonuses after watching videos.  when trying to get your daily bonus and others it plays a video before you can get them. then gets hung up on boot after you close out.  have to reboot game every time and it still does the same thing.  fix updates please. Not getting keys for watching videos",
        "I  like Bingo. I don't like all the ads! If you want me to click on an ad I would appreciate  something in return, like credits or coins. There used to be an option of buying 3 power ups for 500 coins, now I have to click on an ad. Or buy 4  FOR 1000 COINS.  I ALSO NOTED THAT YOU ONLY GIVE BONUSES AT NIGHT, . People like me also play in the daytime.",
        "Never seen such bad cards. It's way too hard to bingo. You get set and wait for 40 numbers and you still don't win. You may not get to daub your first number until the game is over. Not much fun"

        "The game is great! Love the handling and graophics... But I would suggest making the drift angle wider. So instead of hitting 90° and then the counter says \"combo broken\" it could be something like 100°! Cause I mean... Reverse entries are awesome! And you should make the hoonicorn Mustang 4wd instead of rwd in the drift setup!!",
        "I really enjoy this game. Ive maxed out purchases on tracks n cars, modified them all. Now its TOO hard to gain coins to open cars and much exciting tracks.. no updates on additional tracks.. think the optjons should be reviewed. Its now once you get where you are the only way to gain more is to go online to TRY and get coins to get anywhere... which sucks!!!!!",
        "This game won't let me purchase anything. Everytine I start the app I get the \"validation error\" pop-up. I've sent mails to support, left multiple comments but nothing happens. I just get ignored. I am truly over his game with the level of support I am receiving, which is absolutely ZERO!",
        "One thing: (two things actually)  Please make the drift school car available to buy with at least in-game cash maybe for a limited time? And please add a feature that gives you the ability to save replays, that would be really cool.",
        "I think it should have ALOT more cars. I also think that they should alow custom decals and visual upgrades. Also a better online platform. Like a real time multiplayer. Other then that it's an OK game.  Its not been over a year and...it seems like they update this game every...6-7 months, really bad. Gets reallly boring 🤦🏽\u200d♂️",
        "Love the game! But since the update I'm unable to purchase cars/cash. Every time I open the game it says I need to connect to the internet to make purchases even though I'm connected and can still play multiplayer etc. Any help would be great"

        "This game was absolutely perfect and was very much enjoyable, but now to unlock the full experience you have to pay. One of the reasons I enjoy this game and recommended it to my friends is because it is one of the only games that isn't locked behind a paywall. Overall, I have had countless hours playing this game, and trying to land on everything and return successfully. Instead of the microtransaction, why not institute a merit-based system for unlocking parts?",
        "Very great!  Here are a few suggestion from me to make your game more enjoyable :)  1. Can you please make the earth scale correctly because its diameter is around 12.000 km and moon orbit is around 380.000 km  2. Please make a smaller powerful engine like the 9 engines of the falcon 9  3. Please make a button that is simple to cycle from another rocket to another one to ease the attempt of landing a booster  4. Please add an ocean on the earth for some splashdown  5. The last one. Im a free 2 play player and i cant enjoy a majority of the new update :*(",
        "This game is awsome. Loads of fun. Told my friends about it. Could you add a free sandbox mode and more free parts. Thanks. Keep up the good work. Shouldn't have added micro transactions. It just ruined the game for me. Had to take it from a 5 star to a 3 star. Please bear this comment in mind for future updates. This game was 100% free when i downloaded it in december last year. Since then, you added a new build system, free parts which make the game absolutely amazing, and then you add pay for parts. Thats just buzzkill.",
        "Very fast and simple rocket building and great graphics. I wish there was a sandbox mode with infinite fuel. Also there is no indication for loading screens when you hit the launch button. Somethimes you think you tapped the button and end up sitting there for a minute or two wasting time.  Edit So glad they made a small payment option. Well worth the money and glad to support",
        "Great!  Only thing I miss is the ability to rendezvous and dock with another object.  In a moon landing, you could leave a stage in lunar orbit and pick it up for the outbound burn.  Also, karman line should be 100 km??  Edit:. Great updates.  I have no idea how to use docking to reattach parts that have been undocked though.",
        "Can you please add option to center the map on the rocket/vehicle when being in the map mode? It is difficult to switch between near objects in the current version, since I assume the map is stationary relative to the body in which influence sphere we're in at that moment. Also, a \"docking guide\" would be cool in some future update"

        "Nice Game! At the start its easy, like many players said, but maybe they didnt stick through to further their games,I believe the easy start is needed to build for the later part of the games specially if you are a f2p player. Though being F2P isnt as bad here as it is on other games (speaking from experience). I like thier new updates now and specially the \"sweep\" requirement. Thanks Devs! my only hope is that please make planting/ crops a little easier on us common folks,it gets a little bit tiring to have to press from seed&gt;plant repeat (depending on your available field). Anyway, besides this i do not regret playing the game, easy controls, f2p friendly, graphics is good, controls are good. Keep up the good work devs!looking forward to more updates",
        "For the love of God let me grammar check your game...",
        "Very nice and addictive game, i like it.  Would be nicer if pvp is already availble",
        "Nice game. I just hope more free diamonds to be given during quests :)",
        "I love the game but what happened to pk cus you guys are an different company",
        "Downloaded the game just to see LoL heroes like Ahri and Sona on action only to found out most of them in preview screenshots doesn't exist in-game. But overall a fun game and f2p friendly.  Edit: upped my rating to 5 after 5 days playing, you guys deserve it. Keep up the good work. :)"

        "Hey... I would give this game 5 stars but there is 1 main -VE POINT. FUEL takes TOOOOOOOO LONG TO RECHARGE.  The point of this game is to playyyyyy the game. I don't want to keep waiting. I downloaded your great game TO PLAY it. Please try to solve this issue. I will definitely give you 5 stars if you fix this. Please listen to us and read our comments. Most of us are mentioning this 1 -ve point. Thank you",
        "Great game but seriously?  The feul tho.  It takes 30 minutes to charge and it's only 5 as the limit.  Cmon that's bad!  I love this game and it has great graphics and it's a great time killer but please make the fuel like to 10 or make it 10 minutes to recharge.  If so I'll rate 5 star$",
        "This game deserves to be the best game of the year. Its so simple and yet mesmerizing. It is also very fast so you won't get frustrated and could play this game for hours (or until the fuel runs out :-P). This game is quite exciting and the visuals are also nice. This game deserves more than 5 stars. The music blends in quite well and jobs make it more fun. Their are many sources from which you can get rewards which makes it easy and challenging to play. I love this game. Also you can buy more fuel slots in the shop for 100 diamonds. Its expensive but I don't need it beacuse I have to keep track of the time and only play until the fuel runs out.",
        "Really good idea let down massively by the developers. Progress is extremely slow due to fuel taking so long to recharge and having to use gems to buy new vehicles. So unless you want to spend all your money on a free game, it doesn't really feel like you're getting anywhere.",
        "Not too bad. I would have like to see the car while playing, and the graphics could be a touch better. I would honestly like an option between dragging your finger and using buttons on either side of the screen. That alone would have given this a 5-star rating from me",
        "It shouldn't be easier to level up rather than actually playing game. I wouldn't say that the gameplay is difficult to play, but the purposefully placed trucks that shoot you is a bit ridiculous. Other cars are in the way which ultimately eliminates you before you can attack the shooting trucks. There really is no challenge except trying to beat your previous score. I give this game an eh out eh."

        "Love this game but when you are competing with SWGOH for mobile SW content I expect it to be better end game and more Special events. At lvl 8 and there's no more rewards or incentives , so I guess I'm done.   Also, As a busy person I have limited time to play and taking the entire game offline for maintenance, like right now is not a good way to keep me interested.  Dumb move devs.   Edit: good job with update but still need light and dark missions past level 7",
        "You should be matched with someone in your Tier, not 4 Tiers above you. When you play against fellow Guild Members you shouldn't have your levels edited. There should be an option to leave matches during the match. It doesn't make sense to lose because you had something else to do. And here's my biggest problem \"Oh hey, you won that match, here's 30 points.\" \"Oh you lost that match? Lemme just have 51 points from you.\" It also doesn't make sense to have heroes with blasters against melee heroes. They end up at a disadvantage.  Fot example, I was just matched with a level 3 Kylo Ren, as a level One Padme. Sooo fair.",
        "First the unbalance between the factions. Now the match making.. Are you folks fckng serious about it? Your matching a lvl 11 to 13 or 14? How could I win with my lvl 10 troops vs lvl 15 troops? No matter which side I play.. I have a lvl 3 hux and your great system matches me to a lvl 5 anakin with lvl 13 af walkers? Tell me this is a joke.",
        "Won't let me put cards down at mid Battle again and again. Connection will slow you down not your opponent it seems run into this issue way to much. Then issues like won't let you move or play anything but energy goes up",
        "Absolutely love this game. As a life-long Star Wars fan this ticks NEARLY all of the boxes. However, there is one thing that bothers me, hence the \"nearly\". And that is the matchmaking. I'm in tier 5 division 3, and for some reason it decides to pick a person from tier 7 division 2. Of course, I lost because it's unfair. Please sort this out.",
        "My favorite game on mobile right now. It's a mix between a MOBA(League of Legends)  and Clash Royale. You control a hero AND manually deploy different troops in your lane. I've never spent a dime and own all the heroes in game so it is not really pay to win at all. All around great game."

        "Amazing shooter game, awesome hero collecting game, great multiplayer game. Definitely suggest that you at least try it out. But one thing you should look out for, it's pretty easy to sink between 5 and 20 dollars a week into this. Sometimes even 40 to 60. But, it's pretty free-to-play friendly if you can't afford to buy some gold.",
        "I love this game. It's very dynamic and the gameplay is good too. The only problem I have is every single time I do PvP... It pairs me with an opponent far greater than what I can hope to beat. Sure, that's great for improving, but it disheartens me and makes me feel like a horrible player when I can't even beat ONE PvP opponent, ever, while playing the game. I would suggest to the devs that the matching system be a little more flexible when pairing. Give us a matching system that will actually give us lesser prepared players too so we can have the fun of winning, as well. Also, I am disconnected every single time I do PvP battles and bounties. Quite unstable, unfortunately.",
        "I really like the game. It's fun and has enough activities and quests to keep you occupied for a while. My only complaint is how they match people up for the PVP missions. Sometimes you get matched up with people with far higher power and Team level menu which makes it nearly impossible to win. other than that I really enjoy the game",
        "Super fun game. I haven't got bored of the game because there's always events going on which is good. One of the better if not the best shooting game I've played. I think there is a slight glitch when using Steele. Sometimes after I activate his open fire skill he doesn't shoot when I press the shoot button.",
        "Latest update definitely made the game harder. I used to run 4 gauntlet levels with little issue but now I can't get through 1 without losing people. Resurrected characters are completely unwelcome and unfair in pvp when you tell on kills for money. Probably going to uninstall, you're welcome for the money Hothead",
        "Starts off ok but then the pay walls creep in and you are constantly bombarded with prompts to spend money. The PVP is absolutely pointless, highest power rating wins every time without exception so you know if you've won or lost as soon as it picks an opponent. Needs a lot of work before I'd consider dropping any real money on it."

The customerservice page also seems to be a Facebook page, where upon successful contact of the customer service they will ask you for your device model your gamer ID they will ask you way too much information that they do not need as this is all computer based and should be quite self evident as to what server and person is contacting them.

        "Love the concept. Hate that you have to wait for only 300 energy each day that barely gives you anything. Also, if you've made the wrong choices, you can't watch the secret scene without paying. There should be an alternative to that.",
        "Fantastic gameplay, blushing scenes and beautiful artwork. When I ran into a little issue during the game, customer service was absolutely darling! Their patience and kindness really lighten my mood! Would recommend! ~(^-^~) (~^-^)~",
        "The game is a good one but the lack of game time you are given for free each day means you only get a minute of game play every twenty four hours... As much as I enjoy playing I can see I will get tired of slow progress and eventually delete it.... I know we all need to make money and all but you really don't stand a chance to enjoy these games with such little game time.",
        "I LOVE Drogo, and Ryan! I'm on chapter 5 or 6 of Gabriel and I don't even know the point of the story. It drags on and eats your energy up but literally nothing has happened yet",
        "Dear publisher,  though I enjoyed the game I do think that you should give more energy or at least two times to refill per day. Many people (including me) are impatient. Some might give bad reviews and even delete the game. Your dearly, Nina"

        "Ive been playing this for a year and a half and i can say this game is NOT a pay to win. Pull rates are pretty much the same as in any other game, and units are tradable 90% of the time so its possible to get units you want even if youre not lucky enough to get them from packs. Platinum units are super helpful and are now much easier to get thanks to golden medals which are pretty easy to get in events. Theres different events, some are for unions, some you play for yourself. Also, a game with most friendly users ive met in games, willing to give a lot of help and advice to new players. All in all, ive played for a long time and i dont see myself stopping any time soon unless theres drastic changes",
        "I love this game. Though they don't explain how to obtain platinum medals or how unions work very well. And I would like it if we could exchange 7s units better. I could list 10 units I'd rather have then idun. I would love to exchange her for a Gilles de rais or a fenrir. But no I have to keep this unit I don't want. Because my idun can't even be sold on the bazaar. Though those are my only problems. I'm addicted to this game.",
        "It's really a good game. I've been playing this for a long time. The reason I didn't give 5 star is because there is a player who start arguing with the other player for no reason and i hope i can report this to the game developer but my friend say it would never work.",
        "I've been encountering some problems with the game in terms of going through a quest. It just suddenly bonked me out of the game everytime i get to the boss. I've tried clearing the cache  and reinstalling it but  to  no avail.  I'm using an oppof1s  and whether I connect through  Wi-Fi or other means. It does the same thing. Would like some help with this",
        "I have two copies of this 7* card that is essential to my deck at the moment. Unfortunately they screech this annoying Yossshh yaattaadaraa!!!!!! EVERY freaking time they launch a special. Then freaking golden apples fill up the screen. Unfortunately they are two of my strongest cards. Thinking of dropping this game.",
        "Been playing for a long time seeing the game develop but as of recently when they switched to parade. Pay to play has been so heavily support worse than other games from the platinum club or vip to basically making it impossible to win or even compete without spending money in events especially when they make event units untradable this has not happened for 2 years the game has been out and now they r just plain greedy this game is committing game suicide and it was such a great game before but now they always have their hands out for money its really disappointing."

        "Don't play.. they just wanna make money by keeping good planes with themselves.. You can't buy new planes.. A game must be such that when you unlock a plane, You must be able to use them or afford to get them. Greedy company owning the game. Waste of time.",
        "Hiya, vip 4 here... Great games overall. But one light issues i think. In assault mode, the plane cards does not varied much. I keep seeing laserbite, sometimes 2 blaster card and flamer card every assault mode is opened... I have a hard time collecting other plane card...",
        "They rip you off after purchasing high items and pretend you have been forgotten by either sign in. Facebook or Google play games. They Rip you off from the money you spend. It's been done twice to Mee. And no one gets back too about complaints",
        "Previously 5*. Coop and graphics are great. Recently the game has become quite unstable. Units that can't be destroyed, app hangs and crashes, poor object collision detection and many coop games dropped. Most frustrating when your copilot is next to you on wifi and you are watching an unsynced game that suddenly drops.",
        "I have been playing for quite a while until I had to make a reset to my phone (not because of the game of course 😊) but now after the reset I am continuously desperately trying and retrying to reinstall the game but when it  reaches 100% installation it interrupts and tells installation can't be done and go to troubleshooting. Followed the troubleshooting instructions but still same issue 🙁. I would appreciate any help please."

        "Would like more customisation options for my character. This game keeps crashing for no reason and doesn't like to reward it's loyal users. It is a fun game if they just let you play it. Fun game, but the gold farming and inattentiveness to what the users want will ruin it. Great game, lots of potential if taken in the right direction, but WAY to glitchy.",
        "Like most other games, there is too much effort to bait you into micro transactions. The older games were so much better. It's a shame the Devs have resorted to such money grabbing standards.",
        "Kinda annoying game. Teammates won't go after the ball and watching ads sometimes doesn't let you try again.                 Season 3 level 76 is impossible I pass to my guy and he doesn't bother to move a finger.",
        "I like the tactic aspect of it, pretty good time waster. Took me a while to beat it, but didn't have to spend a dollar to do it. The story itself is very unrealistic and after 15 seasons I completely stopped following it and focused only on the games.",
        "Physics are stupid. You pass a high ball to your teammate. A good accurate pass. And the defender wins the header bc your teammate doesn't event jump for the header. Annoying. Also the goalie makes literally humanly impossible saves at times. He can take one step only and move across the goal and block your shot. This game needs real life human physics",
        "What is the problem with this app? In one of your levels you say that I have to hit a goal in 6 kicks or fewer and I have to assist with my hero,when I try doing it, you just make angles that make me pass in the opposite direction and my hero is in the defence and after 1 pass my hero just remains in the defence and that's  why I do not have enough stars to unlock the next season and there are a lot of problems in the other levels also.Please improve it or give me a free season unlock or give me some free stars for every season"

        "Top tier player here, I've been enjoying the game greatly for the most part. My biggest issue would be that energy takes years to recharge. If it was shortened to one or two minutes to Regen one energy then that would be amazing. Another issue I have is that I think all players should receive one SSR when they complete the tutorial. I have a whole team of them, but others aren't so fortunate. Thanks for your time, if one or both of these are changed I will rate this 5 stars!",
        "In short, games got amazing potential. Amazing manga-like visuals? First I've seen for an app. However, they NEED to make the d*$&m game more F2P so the player base is more welcoming, how TF is it you can ONLY get Pandora at VIP 8?!..   Also, many-many other great games do offer lifetime gem login purchases.   Just saying. ;)",
        "Nice. They added new characters. I'm waiting for Namida, Brandi and Sora's SSR forms, hope they come soon. There's one problem I'm having with the recent update though. I can't play Soul Towers Battle in Special Trials because my phone keeps crashing. The gameplay in other areas are running smooth, only the Soul Towers Battle causes my phone to crash. Fix it please...",
        "I really loved the gameplay and the characters, but then all of my dadta got lost and i had to start from the begining. I made it so far within the story and leveld up my characters so much. Grinded for a few hours to get the materials and money i needed. It was all for nothing. Fix this bug pls. Hope this doesnt happen to your account",
        "Not so much a review, but I can't figure out how to unlock the last two outfits.(Gal.cat and the blue yakata). Any help much appreciated. Cannot find guides anywhere. Is this game p2w? Somewhat but you can unlock everything without paying.",
        "It's just a pay to win game. I'm very disappointed for the energy bar... I need 13 hours and 36 minutes to recharge to full at this point. Difficult to upgrade characters and their skills and everything you want to do you must pay. As a game (idea) awesome but unplayable if you can't afford it"

        "The developers do not contact you with game issues in any timely manner, you spend months playing for the game to randomly unshield your base before the time has even expired causeing losses when there shouldnt be any. And support like i said is terrible do not waste your time or money downloading this! You will only be disappointed in the end.",
        "After playing for 10 months straight every day, still come back, even though everything is done very slow by that advanced level of the base, therefore it's addictive. A sci-fi setting in a familiar and loved universe helps, of course.  Just need to be able to send to other players various items, boosts, and shields, not only resources, that would make it much more interesting at this point!",
        "I would rate the game higher but it needs major work. The wait times for smaller troop tiers and beginning research is horrible. Makes the game boring.  I am waiting to see if I continue to play it. Depends if anything changes. To research for tier 2 infantry takes over a day. At this current time this is a very pay to play game as you would want speedups. This is odd for Plarium. I enjoy their other games. This one needs vast improvement and fast if they want to keep people around. As well the game is in desperate need of an in game translator!!!",
        "I really love this game. Easy controls. Yes, it takes a little longer to upgrade various parts of the base as you level up. I encountered the first war. WOW!But, One thing, please tell to upgrade this Draedulus-12 leader. He is at level 23, 3%. He still look the same. OVERALL-AWESOME.!!!",
        "I loved this game initially but one massive problem I have experience is the chat box within your leagues forum. It is massively glitched and when you type or try to delete one word then ten new ones randomly come on screen. This makes chatting to your team mates almost impossible. I asked plarium many times to fix this but they keep ignoring. You want a game where you can chat with ease with your team mates",
        "I m playing this game for long time and i liked this game but now this game asking too much .So many back to back events .I think the game maker must know that all playing this game have a real life to deal with.Reduce back to back events.I m sure if u guys dont do it most players will quit and this game will be longer played."

Because of slow loading it will kill your battery life fast as well. Please help to fix the problem and I will re-rate again. Thanks",

Not too mention every other minute it forces you to watch an ad or tries to get you to buy something from them. I will be deleting this app once i finish posting this comment.",

I have the silver subscription ($1.00/weekly) and im unable to take advantage of the content im paying for  want a refund. The upgrades and new equipment are too expensive, the gear and parts are also too expensive and hard to come by especially for the spearfishing which is the best part of the game.. You certainly can't get very far without spending some real money. You can be killed by animals when the come from behind so you with your limited turning capability you have no chance to defend yourself. A lot of problems.",

        "To the guy that says stop bitching cuz it's free. Reviews are so they can get feedback to improve the game. What good is the game if you can only play 2 games a day? There are too many other games out there that are free that customers can get chips to play for hours. This game should take care of their loyal customers before they move on to some of the other games. So many have posted about the small amount of chips received and they added the spinning wheel, maybe by reading the reviews they are listening and trying to improve chances of getting more chips. If everyone continues to give low reviews, maybe just maybe they'll increase our chances to get more daily chips!",
        "Purchased 90 rockets pack. Explained to me how I used all 90 in one game? Smh, that's too much.. So y'all want ppl to purchase rockets each hand. Y'all can do better. Chip packages as well. Maybe u will get more to contribute to the game. Smh, better chip packages probably will definitely help this game. Especially the price of chips to play verses what the rooms payout... Really is at a disadvantage to players to even purchase.",
        "I usually love this game. However, today I decided to treat myself and purchase some chips to get the last two battle ships that I needed to get 800 chips. The game is so frigging rigged it's just sad. It took all 600 chips that I bought and all that I won trying to accomplish a goal.  I will NEVER purchase chips again, especially in this game.",
        "Most of my purchases lately have been strange disappearing chips and rockets i have spent SO much  money on this game!!! and another thing i could not access any games for 2 days now but it TOOK ALL MY CHIPS AGAIN SOMETHING NEEDS TO BE DONE I HAVE ALREADY CONTACTED YOU IN REGARDS TO THIS.",
        "Good variety of games. Not many free chips once the first few rounds are played when compared to what the rounds cost. Be ready to buy, buy, buy if you aren't patient. They have added many more chances for free chips. Thank you guys.",
        "I love the game again.  I'd been struggling with glitches and now they're fixed  I'm especially loving the free chips you give sometimes daily!  I've become re-addicted to it!  The new format IS easier to see, but it gets slightly boring when the two cards you CAN daub don't get any numbers!  It looks as if you're phasing out the gems, which is fine with me; I'd rather have all free daubs, chips, and only a FEW coin power plays.  The free daubs make all the difference between winning and losing.  Also, would like to see winning bingos actually give me the items I need to complete rooms and for you to increase the daily chips for every completed room."

        "Fantastic game! It's by Gameloft so it's bound to be a good phone game. It's not unfair, but you do have to have some skill. It doesn't hold your hand but it's not hard to learn the controls. Despite the fact that you're also playing against people who are on their computers as well, it's definitely not unfair. One request: maybe add more options for your killstreaks. I would love to have my drone and turret on the same killstreak for my sniper class but I'm stuck with recon instead. Still love it tho :)",
        "Seems like a good game. Has gotten allot of good reviews also. Is ashame I can't play it though. I downloaded it, and when I start it tells me I must download the update files. Which I did, even though that's when MORE DATA USAGE. Now it won't even load past a certain percentage, haven't gotten to play yet, even after DIDN'T TONS if files and data worth of the game.........Pls fix so I can actually try the game. I WILL EDIT THE REVIEW IF I GET TO PLAY",
        "When im playing online and doing some online events i get credit and xp points after the mach and then when i get kicked out and coming back i have lost everything. This is boring and i want you to fix this problem. I cant play online anymore because there's no one's playing but when my friend is playing on he's phone he always find a mach. Please fix those problems",
        "I like the game but only when i actually works!! It doesn't let me change the graphics settings and it's crashing constantly after each game i play. That's frustrating for such a huge title I'm running android 7.0 on a redmi note 4",
        "It's a game where people will get addicted to it after playing it once.. But every time when we are installing app we have to play the untill 1st check point.. Better developers fix this. So after immediately after installing user must go to his account and sync game data..",
        "This game is awesome and addictive. My second First Person Shooter Game After Modern Combat 3: Fallen Nation.  I only wish the Game Developers can bring back the game control we had in Modern Combat 3: Fallen Nation; especially in terms of the gun control, and also create an offline PvP mode using Hotspot and Wi-Fi to connect players. Putting these two features in place will make this game undisputed First Person Shooter Game Ever.  In the near future, we should be considering how one can make real cash while playing online games like this."

        "I don't like you can't make the buildings the color you want to because you have to change them to level up. Leveling up takes forever if your not willing to spend a lot of actual money. My horses stay needing the infirmary so they are always busy which means they are not available to complete guest wishes, or for breeding, or training. It cost a ton to add spots in the buildings for supplies or to be able to have more than one horse in a building at once. Wish it didn't cost so much I would have really liked the game. Will be deleting this app",
        "The game starts off being a great game but then becomes a huge cash grab once they think the have you hooked.  Too bad cause this has the potential to be a top contending game if they would just ease up on the cost of some items.",
        "I like the game except the fact that things are very expensive and you don't get a lot of money from customers. Plus I have to level up a horse to fulfill a board request but then can't put that horse in any of my buildings because they are a lower level...this is an issue with guests too. I go to upgrade to the next level (4) but when I click the color I need it doesn't give me the amount of fix up points it claims (ex: +75 for lavender but it only foes up +5 on the meter). And half my guests want items I can't give them because I am nowhere near the amount of money required to purchase the building.  I think upsets needs to reformat the pricing of items within the game or up the amount given by guests. Because eventually I may find myself at a point I can no longer continue as I will not spend actual money.",

        "Well it's one of the best games I've played. The only problem I'm having is that on multiplayer  there is new real order some races you can smoke a guy others you can get smoked and have no chance of winning. If you could update to change that I would have a lot more fun with this game",
        "Great game for a short while unless you have money to dump in it. Once you get to your 7th or 8th car, the prices sky rocket. Oh and the last car? Will take you weeks to make enough money to purchase because the online races are RARELY fair. I often am matched with the class above my car who has nearly as many mechanical points into it. Doesn't make sense, losing streaks of 10 or more happens frequently. Good luck if you want a fun and rewarding FREE experience. No luck needed if you dump money into it and a lot of money, their p2p packages very expensive.",
        "Fun racing game.  Good time waster, as with most games like this, you can NEVER upgrade your cars enough.  Free crates don't drop parts needed enough, Elite crates take way to many tokens.  And there again the chance of getting great parts or Free cars are NOT going to drop for you.  And the Tuning is very complicated.  And way to many online cheaters, that you can hardly beat.",
        "Everything is awsome about it besides one thing   That ome this is when your storage is full and you get a surprise part from racing it only gives you two options to discard it or to buy a new slot. what would really be helpfull is if you could trade a part for it and instead of having to discard it",
        "Awesome Game! A bits a bit hard to level up and lock the super cars though. Also cars are very expensive. Wish there was SUVS and pickups as well! Other than that great game easy controls and all",
        "If you don't plan on spending money don't even both. It cost me $20 just to get out of the first level. Then you win all these prizes but can only collect them if you spend real money on there gold. $$$ so sad because it is a fun game."

        "Pretty cool Bingo. It would be nice if more scratchers were available to collect puzzle pieces so you can collect more prizes. Even though you can still win cherries after you completed the scratcher, it seems kind of pointless. My suggestion would be either add more scratchers or remove it once all of the cherry prizes have been collected.",
        "When I first started playing over 6 months ago everything was great. It is the best bingo game on Google Play and I have tried every one of them. but the last 78 bingo games I have played, I have not got one Bingo and I barely get any of the numbers it calls. The last 10 numbers it called on one of them, I didn't even get one of the numbers. Everything started going south when I started spending money. If you download this game, do not spend money. If you do, it will not give you any bingos so you will keep spending money. Like every other game, it's a money grabber😔 but unfortunately this one is worse than most 😠 Thanks Bingo Pop!",
        "By far, the best bingo app on the market.  There aren't any false numbers or bingo daubs . It also gives you a chance to  earn the cherries instead of paying for them.   They've mixed in ads to the game so it doesn't feel like you're watching commercials between every game.",
        "Out of cherries in less than an hour. Wins are not enough to keep playing. Odd that they would even have a high roller room. Guess you gotta purchase the cherries. FAIL",
        "Wouldn't even let me play. Kept saying I was too young to play even though it didn't give me an option to enter my age",
        "It would be great if there was a way to collect coins and cherries on the Facebook app page. Kind of frustrating"

        "Great gameIncredible game. But when you move up in lvls the cost of every detail is ludacris! I've played this game a month and spent good money on it.  I am not into waiting a half a day so I can gain a 5 min advantage, then turn around and do it again. Only this time, just wait longer! .... Or of course you could just spend be re $.... Awesome game... makers are greedy!",
        "I'm not happy that I can only send 20 gold from my accounts to one of my accounts per day. I'd like to send more gold per day. Annoying 2 alliance war battle limit should be gotten rid of. It's annoying, expensive and takes a very long time to reach each level of the game. Overall, it's a good game to play but it can be improved",
        "The last few days this game become completely useless and unplayable. The matchmaking has been tweaked to the point where I'm being attacked by significantly higher players, without even a possibility to retaliate! At the same time when I try to attack in quick match, the level of my opponents is being so high, that I have zero chances winning a simple attack.  I'm thinking about uninstalling this game permanently. When contacted, Zynga employee suggests to spend more money to upgrade my defenses. How is that for \"humanly friendly\" customer service? Horrible service.",
        "After getting to HQ level 10 it just got so boring.  To be honest don't like the game play playing against other people either.  The play is slanted toward the attacker .  Deleted",
        "It's quite unreasonable that the nuke is too close to other command items! So, please give me back a nuke, and 40000 fuels as well as 5000 metals for reviving robot and retraining tanks! Also put the nuke to other corners!",
        "Game has a fun, friendly community of players. Load times kinda slow. Occational bugs and glitches. Usually following after updates. Overall though a fun game that has new features added frequently, keeping it interesting."

This has happened to me several times already and I'm passing thus information on. Please, King Games, investigate this immediately because I enjoy your games and would like to see this resolved. Thank you.",

Why can't I send lives anymore?!  Thank you! For updating the game! I almost uninstalled this game cuz it was taking so long. Hello! Out of levels! Hurry up please! I enjoy the game, but I'm all caught up. I've been trying to up my scores just to have a reason to keep the game on my phone. So far so good. I just started today and I'm enjoying it! Thank you! More recently, I love it! I've been trying to find a game with the quality of King games in this category and no one is a good! Thank you!",
        "Love this game! It's challenging, addictive and beautifully developed both visually and audibly.My complaints would be:   *Certain aspects of the game are not clear, with nowhere to reference. So certain occurrences just seem incidental and therefore don't allow you to fully strategize.   *There are no written rules or explanations to refer to. Additionslly, the game is not customizable. I was just assigned a random avatar (which I don't like) which doesn't appear adjustable.  *It also used my real name to identify in the game, even though I had already created one before registering to King Games. Worse, there seems to be no way to change this either.  If there is a way already developed to address these issues, please help!",

        "I stop playing C C because I loved this game... I noticed that we use way more than we get!! And to only get a few tickets for every 10 Bingo's then having to wit for 22hrs....only 4 tickets and hr...and it takes way to long to get to the next level and when do reach it we get very little tickets!!! Dont have to many deals to get both tickets and special prizes... Also how does it when a game starts right after a tournament that I end up in the thousand plus  rank below the bronze??? As much as I love this game think its time to give it a rest until there re more incentives to bring me back!!!",
        "My game keep freezing up and not submitting my scores not giving me boosters I acquired during that round. Please fix the issues and give me back my points and boosters. Thank you   I just played again and I played the whole game but when it's time to tally the score the game freezes. I lost 3 footballs and a treasure chest plus my points. Please respond to my issues. I haven't heard from anyone yet. But I still like the game. Just want it to stop robbing me....",
        "This is definitely a fun bingo app. Where it's lacking or otherwise could be improved, comparatively to ther Bingo games, is the daily spin wheel & daily sign in bonus. Daily 24hr sign in should provide a much larger number of free tickets & include daily free power ups. Earning one or two power ups w a single spin of the wheel is anticlimactic! Power ups are a vital way to  daily tournament advancement, bingo wins & simy make playing more fun. Completing a pizzule is impossible without power-ups or making a purchase. However, a big win for this app. is the ability to sign in each new day to a new tournament which helps level the playing field. Special tournaments and/or the add' side bonuses, like the \"turkey daub\" made playing & making a purchase worth wild!",
        "Good, keeps me coming back for more. The only thing I don't like is there is no way of getting that many puzzle pieces in the time. Could you maybe let us play till we get the Puzzle Complete to get the rewards.",
        "I am addicted to this game. I think you should get more power ups instead of ticket's. Cause you run out of power up's. I feel you should get bingo power up's instead of ticket's. On the bonus spin they should add bingo power up's of 4. I need more bingo power up's. And would like to get power up's for daubing every number called each game. I need more power Up's. And the game should give you tickets when you get every number that is called correctly on each card every game that you play.",
        "The new additions of the outlaws was great, but then you added all these \"special\" days that serve no purpose but to make people spend money. I have spent plenty already but not for every game. Sorry guys, bad move. Too greedy."

The picture also wobbles a bit while zooming in or out. I'd also improve the tapboxes since tapping on the sky takes me to the fortifications panel for some reason. The map also seems pretty dull. Apart from all that, the UI is simplistic and I like it. I just wish there were more things to do.",

I did the math someone attacked 2 of my forts but didn't have silver to claim them, so I didn't bother sending that much support (just trickled). Guess what the person was a pay to win and had sent rubies, I lost both my forts. That's why rubies are dumb."

        "It's a good bingo game with a good amount of variety. Love the fact that you can play in different rooms and get bonuses with the puzzles! I was wondering if buying the elite pack is a one time purchase or a monthly fee. Couldn't find the answer anywhere. One tip to make it even better would be to make the tickets a little easier to get. Otherwise would give 5 stars!",
        "My only issue with this game is that u almost have to end up purchasing tix to continue to play. The further u move on in the game, the more tix each card costs & ur only given a certain amount thru a daily reward. App should provide ways to earn more tix, either thru a daily spin or higher rewards. *(since app developer replied to this review, I changed my review to 4 stars)",
        "The game itself is very fun.  However, if you run out of tickets, it is way too difficult to earn more.  Apparently, they made it easier to earn tickets but after playing many other games, the update isn't enough.  To continue playing, you must buy tickets.  I may have to delete the game which is a shame because it really is a fun game.    3/18/18... They tell you to play lower cost games to get more rewards but it doesn't.  It just takes you a bit longer to go through your tickets but you don't win anything.  Time to delete.  Graphics were great and games were fun but without tickets you can't play.",
        "Really liked this game. Now i cant play it because its near impossible to get more tickets. I cant complete daily tasks as I have no tickets and ive got to wait ages to get daily tickets. Even then there gone within 5-10minutes and cant get no more until following day. Games dont pay out enough either when you win",
        "It's been nice...I'm happy to share: they heard us. We can earn power now, the games are fun, excellent pace. Thank you \"Dataverse\", I appreciate your changes 💯 ☠☠☠☠☠ UPDATE: n again 1/11. again: I ventured and came back. I can buy credit in January. Cuz we HAVE to have boosts to play long. Here I go !Update. I like a lot. Spent 20 but you simply can't spend enough.  must buy boosts too. Boosts get stuck",
        "I really like this Bingo  game.  A few upgrades and it will  be better than all the other Bingo games.  I love the amount of tickets it gives you to play.  I love the extra stuff you can earn and not have to pay for.  A couple of things that would  make this game better would be all 4 cards on one screen in tablet mode, the power ups being applied automatically  and being able to daub that last number that's  called cause usually that's the one needed for Bingo.  Otherwise its great.  I hope  you find this useful.  I understand  if you can't  fix all three of these but the first 2 are more important  than the last and i understand  there can only be a certain amount of bingos i guess.  Thank you.  Real close to being a 5 but those 3 issues really hold me back as I'm  sure it does others as well."

I played this game with a lot of people.  It was my favorite ga   me.  Want to play again!!!!                            It now works but you started me over and took all my life's I had saved up.  I was on level 700.  I used to really like this game and played it every day.  I hope I don't have to delete this game because I am not starting over!  Put me back where I was with my life's!",

When you ask for help they will always 1st ask \"is this the most updated edition\", even if you already told them you game is on automatic update. Its a good game, just frustrating to deal with",

        "I finished the last castle on garden island. I have never spent any money throughout the entire game. Every game can be won without spending any money. The game is challenging but that is the fun. I played the same game on my smartphone and my tablet and I have been able to conquer all the islands on both. How about another island? When is a new island coming? I scored over 6,000,000 points on the King's castle to end the game. Get a new island, please.",
        "The only problem I have with this game is the need to rely on friends to help you if you run out of money to pay your ransome.  Because if like me you have no friends who play the same games.. This is a problem that needs to thought out or find another way for the player to hook up with other players.",
        "Great challenging fun only bad thing is I beat it twice reset progress again to start over yall need to add more islands I hate to Uninstaller to make room for another game but please update other than that it's good",
        "Should have more ways to win power ups and bills way more often. Would make it more fun without being haggled into spending my hard earned money on a phone game.",
        "Not bad. Shame the characters are not diverse in this day and age.",

I have j3 6 which is pretty bad and still runs well. Very optimized, sleek game. Also alot of updated to keep the game fresh and the microtransactions are very fair.",
        "Very fun game, wish it wasn't energy based, would definitely enjoy it more. The fishing is 'new' right now and i have to say the percentages are garbage. 75 percent is more like 50, 50 percent is like 10 percent,  25 percent is closer to 50. This is just my personal experience. The games is really fun though, expect to get annoyed with the fishing percentages however. Also energy gets spent super fast in this game, very fun yet very limited.",
        "It's good and alot of fun but it's a bit of a tedious grindfest. 150% item find and I found nothing after going through ten dungeons. I want to keep playing but it's just another pay to win type. I understand you need to make money but I can buy a full loadout of epic equipment and run through a great portion of the game in no time. It's definetly worth giving a try but unfortunetly it's not for me.",
        "I fell in love with this game as soon as I opened it the first time. But there is a problem which forces me to give it a 2 star rating. It kicks me out of the game every 5 minutes and that way I can't get any progress done. I absolutely enjoyed the little playtime I got and I want to play it more but it won't let me. Great job otherwise devs!",
        "Fun and amazing game, great time killer for me, I just love these pixelated games so much.. to be fair it sounds like it's more Terraria and pokemon mixed typa thing y'know.. 5 stars",
        "Been playing this for about a week.  It's a lot of fun with a variety of different things to do.  Running out of energy for doing dungeons doesn't matter a lot as there are three or four other things to do in game that don't require energy.  Will be making a purchase to support the devs.  Good game!"

        "This game is rigged!!!!  Get dealt two seven of clubs as a pocket pair.  Get a seven of spades on the river and lose to someone that had two pair.   And I have a pic saved of my pocket pair.   Last time I checked it is impossible to be dealt two of the same card.   And in what world does a three of a kind lose to two pair.   Will never spend money on this app again!!!!!!!    So glad to receive a generic response...   It would have been nice if you actually read the review.  It doesn't matter how lucky you are. You cannot get get 2 of the exact same card dealt in the same hand.  And no matter how lucky you are 3 of a kind shouldn't be losing to two pair.  That just the rules of poker.",
        "Use to be Terrific, last 2 weeks the game froze on my winning hand causing me to loose to Those Ugly Figurines..... No matter how my h or how I play this game is RIGGED to have those Monsters, break you...  Every Time ...... Beginning Not To Respect This Money Vaccum",

        "Greetings Making Fun,  Let me start off by saying that I absolutely love this game. It's entertaining, challenging and addictive. The storyline is engrossing and the graphics are spectacular as well. You can easily tell how addictive a game is by the amount of time you spend playing it at a stretch. Let me just say that I've been playing this game ever since I installed it. Whenever I sit down with my device, I start playing it and I keep on playing for at least two hours before I divert my attention to other matters. It's a really lovely and delightful game. Making Fun seems like the most suitable title of the developers because they've made something that is really a lot of fun. Well done. I highly recommend this game. DOWNLOAD IT TODAY.",
        "Awesome game. Good graphics, great sound and music, intricate leveling up system and character build, easy controls, variety in enemies, lots of replay value, lots of gear to find, and doesn't take much data space. Reminds me of a Diablo type game. The developer's really do deserve a lot of praise for creating such a quality game and not making it a p2w. This is an example of doing it right. I can tell that a lot of thought and care was put into it. Absolutely brilliant. I can't praise enough. A rare gem on the play store, and completely free. Just awesome. 6 out of 5 rating. Thank you so much for such a great game.:) Edit: Thanks for the update. You guys rock.",
        "Good looking game plays very smoothly. Fun to play and not too hard or too easy. Nice little details like the way your hero talks and has other party members. These things help make the single player game seem less lonely. I don't know if I am going to hit a pay wall or loose interest. The story is engaging enough. I just don't give out 5 star reviews.",
        "Good game. Defintely like that you can play offline. Most of my issues with it are really minor except for the fact that the background especially things like walls, trees and hills can sonetimes block your view. There have been a bunch of tines where I couldn't see enemies that were right next to me because a wall was there.",
        "Great game so far! Love the old school feel to the game! Resembles Diablo a lot! But I love the Diablo series so being able to play a game like that from the palm of my hand...GOLD! Tons of customization from characters, skills and equipment upgrades. Most of the better items are obtained just by playing! No need to buy items, save those gems for more skills to adding more companions to fight along side you! Running low on gems...just keep playing! Love a game that rewards you just for playing! Keep up the good work guys! I don't post reviews unless it's worth it so......see you out there!",
        "The gameplay is the best ive seen for an android RPG Diablo type game. Slick graphics, awesome sound track and effects, no slowdown and you can play offline!! Absolutely love the game. Only down side is the worry of repetitivness of the game but i guess only time will tell"

The tap-to-move control is more natural and relaxing than thumbsticks, and it’s also truer to the vintage point-and-click Action RPG experience.The game can be really played for free, as more than 90% of our players do.

Through years of polishing, and feedback from millions of players, the quality of the game has steadily increased, making it now one of the highest rated games on all app stores.As of fall 2017, major new features are in advanced stages of development, including real-time multiplayer, town portal, and a fourth world.Enjoy the visceral satisfaction of responsive, fast-paced combat, with spectacular special effects, pleasing sounds, rewarding damage numbers, all set against immersive backdrops and atmospheric, inspiring music scores.Play as a Mage, Warrior or Bounty Hunter, wielding a sword, axe, staff or gun.

        "As a veteran to games like this, I wish I could jump past all the tutorial steps.  That aside decent graphics, story is straight forward. Would be cool if there was secret rooms /treasures.  Like if you walked in and out of a certain room 10 times consecutively a secret chest would appear. But this is just me looking for something different.",
        "What the hell Its been 5 years this game hasn't change a bit. Same old graphics and even there are players online. Cant play multiplayer battle .  you guys made me wait so much more when will I be able to play multiplayer and all add new stuff . This game is far more better that dh5 plz add more features gameloft guys plz dont make me wait",
        "Dungeon Hunter 4 is one of the best mobile games I've ever played. Its great for passing time, its just endless destruction. The game never really ends, theres always more demonic entities and hell spawn to kill.",
        "Finally after a year of looking, found an RPG game that is easy and fun to play.  So many games are way too busy with graphics and controls are hard to use.  Like that you can play both off line and on line.  Will be playing this for awhile.  Now to explore the online game features.",
        "This is a great game, reminds me of the old Diablo games. But one been having trouble with the events tab. Every time I try to click on it, I get a pop up to play DH5, and then it says the event is no longer available (error 70000021) afterwards it won't get back to the gameplay unless I quit the app and restart it.",
        "Really like this game.  Only one tiny issue; during the cut scenes i can only hear what's happening. .. my screen turns black. Other than that it's great! I'm on a galaxy tab s2."

        "I had to change my rating for this game because I seriously believe it is rigged for me to stop advancing. Everything was great until I made it to pro level and now I'm noticing that whenever I am tied with another player with gems, an extra gem magically appears in the hole making me lose that round. How is it possible that I made it to pro level winning a good percentage of games and now I have played at least 50 rounds on level 3 and can't win a single one?",
        "A great app to download. Great format and graphics. Lots of fun and challenging. Rated everything 5 star other than gameplay. It's good but not great due to the water hazard or out of bounds shots.  Players can hit into the water yet still finish on par. Water hazard should automatically be 2 shots. If this gets changed it would be 5 star no doubt and best golf app.  Single mode would be fantastic to practise",
        "To many play just to attack your ball after you hit. Regardless if they don't play well they win. A bit eh. The way it's done barely allows you to win. I agree with many others reviews. Something fishy about the scoring system and who you are placed against. Won't keep long if it continues. Could be awesome if it wasn't unfair. O.o",
        "This game is ok at best. More about luck then skill. Fun and addictive, yes at times. Ive collected all the trophies from 3 of the maps and was on a roll. Then out of nowhere a 15 game lose streak. You will get to the point past anger. There are a lot of pretty good/lucky players from around the world.",
        "Overall, game quality is pretty solid. Few graphic glitches here and there but can be expected. It would be nice to rotate to see a better perspective and easier to hit.   One must improvement needed is that when you play a bot, it's way too noticable. You need to improve the bot intelligence! I understand why bots would be needed time to time.  Coins could be cheaper too.  EDIT: Game froze on a Pixel XL, cost me lots of coins! Not happy.",
        "Not bad. Sometimes freezes a little during game play but usually resolved itself. The wind is usually fair for each player's turn so that's good. Overall a good little time waster game. The only thing I would suggest is to make it a little easier/more often that gold bricks get collected. I've played for over a month now and got about 8 since starting."

        "Wish the hearts were half price and that I could replay episodes without paying a new ticket. I've spent an embarrassing amount of money, about 900usd and counting. The overall quality of the stories is good. The variety of characters is good, but it would be nice to have more than one female love intrest per story. Go Persephone! 😻😚💘",
        "This is great! The best romance game I've come across. Only thing is maybe more female love interests and definitely have a system that gives you like 5 hearts a day? Just to get those back because I haven't played the game in a week and a half because of no hearts.",
        "Hearts are too expensive and the hearts needed for some choices are way too high. Daily loggin rewards don't have a good enough chance to get them either. Stories are great and I enjoy them very much. Would recommend for others even those who don't want to spend the money. I myself haven't paid a cent because of the high prices.",
        "I really enjoyed reading different stories. Loving this apps.Just please add more tickets... and also it takes forever to waitq for the next season or episodes..it spoils my excitement.. please don't make us wait .. your stories are all really good..just make it more fast in adding new season or episode please please please",
        "I've been playing the game for a really long time now since I was 13 or 14 and am now 17 turning 18 this year and I'm sooooo happy with how it's grown but the one issue I have is the hearts thing. I can't pay the specific amount to get a whole stash of heart and it really bugs me because I love the options that you give us but I don't have hearts...can you please look into it and come up withe something ?",
        "This game is addicting and is very fun I think you will love it.I did so try it out and see what happens.The one I loved the most was gangster love ash so I advise you to try that one out if you want.Also with the gangster love series try out chance he's fun"

Even with the dark matter bonuses and increased infectivity from your bacteria slots it takes too many attacks and nanos. The game desprately needs a way to penetrate shields, or reduce shield strength.",

        "The game is a decent enough time waster. However, when you begin getting into higher numbers the game breaks. I have over 100x the required about of bacteria to destroy a planet but it still says i can only take out 99.48%.  I have currently 75.528 oo bacteria and the planet Esloytis says it requires 47.310 nn bacteria to complete, but im at 99.7%. The numbers being dealt with are literally astronomical and unfathomable as a human, but following the progression of the game so far it would seem i have fathoms more bacteria than should be required.",

I have been wanting a diamond character and now you took it away from me. How can anyone get a diamond level character now. There is no way to purchase them either as they are elite pack exclusive cards. Not very happy. Waiting for this to be fixed until I'm satisfied.",
        "Best game I have played, however after the updates i can't seem to see other game modes like faction wars challenge mode and even quest mode. I have reinstalled a couple of times, I have seen those missing modes in a novice account but whenever I log into my wbaccount they disappear leaving me with normal mode and  the tower mode.",
        "Love the game. Hackers though ruin it, especially in faction wars in hard and fatal battles. For the ones who just updated, faction wars will show up within 12/24 hrs however not sure bout quest mode. Been playing actively for over 2 years, but still don't have All maxed out equipment or all maxed out characters. Hackers have everything maxed out which makes a mockery of our equipment.",

My new phone is a galaxy s8 and I wonder if I can transfer my iPhone account to my galaxy. I don't to start over while my other phone have great and exclusive characters. Please help.",
        "I love the game and new update. But i am soo disapointed, that you promissed us Injustice raiden and klassic mileena, still there are no challenges about them. Please make a new challenge a bout those charecters. Also injustice scorpion, undercover cassie cage and others. Please make this right.",

Even with nothing else, I still have to do a factory reset on my phone to delete everything just to reinstall this game every time they decide to do an update!"

        "It's okay. The graphics are endearing. Controls and gameplay are smooth and easy to understand. A freemium game to be sure. It openly offers over-priced items like they are a great deal (they aren't). Most of it's purchase items are more expensive than other games. It has a gem subscription but for only 10 days, most simular games offer it for the full month for the same price, while offering more gems.",
        "OMG THIS IS AWESOME PEOPLE DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY ARE MISSING THE GRAPHICS AND CONTROLS AND EVERYTHING ABOUT IT IS GREAT!!!!!! Except for the part when you raid somebody and the opponent's team always kills you before you kill them. ANYWAYS IT'S STILL THE BEST keep the updates coming IT IS SO FUN DESPITE NOBODY I KNOW EXCEPT FOR MY FAMILY EVEN KNOWS IT EXISTS GREATEST GAME EVEEEERRRRRR!!!",
        "Multitude of heroes to make your team. Not stingy about giving the player stuff. Potential fun for all, as casual game. Has PvP elements. Energy bar system replenishes when level up and even progresses in size as you advance. Should not be an issue until you get farther in, random energy gains also occur on maps with a little luck. Short tutorial at game beginning is torture to endure but is over in under 5 min. Great free game!",
        "Love the game so far. You could say I'm a try hard because I've only been playing the game for a month and a week and I'm already level 52. With 100% win rate and 83% defense rate  have one of the best teams in the game. And like I said before love it so far but for the next update. You'll should add friendly battles. Such as battling with your friends, clan mates, random players. Etc.",
        "Pretty fun game but I had an issue happy pretty quickly into the game and I'm hoping devs see this and help out.  I bought ten common portals for the 100k gold, after opening the first one the game decided to crash and I am no longer able to redeem my 9 other chest. I change to 5 star if we can this resolved. Thanks",
        "Hi, I don't know if it is a hack or what BUT even if my defenders WON then still it minus my POINTS and it shows that I LOST? Whereas the replay is different. And morover Aria's sand in eyes should also provoke the target. And legendary heroes are sometimes not getting worth. They need Interesting passives. Thx. Plz reply 😘"

        "This is probably the best horse game I have found so far. The porportions and the way the horses move are very accurate. A lot of horses in games I have seen have disporortionate bodies and are, over all, very unattractive.  The art style is similar to Spirit. Which was a big head-turner for me.",

When are the problems going to be fixed. This is worse then my beta tester games. Very unhappy also don't expect Ubisoft to help u",
        "I'm playing this game for almost two years, and never get bored. I uninstalled a lot of game's on this time except Horse Haven: World Adventures. At this moment I think we need a Grand Stable for fantasy land, and another land for exclusive horse's, they are so much now on the game. Thank you Ubisoft for this awesome game. ❤️",
        "I would definitely recommend this game to horse lovers. However, it doesn't satisfy me and the quite some Dutch players since it has our neighbouring countries Germany and France but not our own. It feels as if our country is just being neglected. It would be great if someone could do something about this issue.",
        "So i have a problem with the app.......... After we race we should get the pieces to unlock the horses  the amount depends on the which place u get cuz im mostly at my mums but i only have a ipad at my grans (its hers) kind regards Me and my family 😄😁🤗😂😉💙💙💙💙💙🐎🐎🐎 So... i try to activate the horse breeds for 10 diamonds i have 15.. It says i dont have enough FIX IT NOW 😠",
        "It's a great game, I love that I get to interact with the horses and the graphics is good then only down fall is I can't earn money that much and you run out of it quick, and you can't make enough for crops or upgrading, since you have to upgrade alot to get food for the horses."

Has caused me to not play for a day or two because of this but also what makes me come back it offers that challenge that is often lost in most games like this where is the fun of there is no risk. Not to many tedious tasks after about day 5 no longer logging in every 3 hours to start a build project or something.",

        "Would of given 5 stars if it wasnt for the 300 energies as it doesnt go very far, would be better if it refilled twice a day instead of once. Why do you have to spend money on special scenes they should be unlocked if you picked the right choices not pay for them. Apart from that love the story and the graphics are great if these issues could be sorted that would be great",
        "I downloaded this due to the narrative and the reviews, but I am not a fan of this game. 300 energies (30 sentences) is very short I get through it in about 3 minutes and then you wait an entire 24hours for another. I love the storyline and the graphics so therefore this would be good for someone who is a slower reader. It's a shame but I will be uninstalling.",
        "Wish there was more energy or like an easier way to get more energy. I get 450 energy for the day with the initial 300 and playing the mini game which gives 100 and watching the adds which is 50. But it's not enough I feel like I only get about a couple sentences in and then I run out. Maybe if you could play the mini game every hour or two to get the 100 energy and watch the ads around the same time to get 150 instead of waiting 24 hrs it would be better. The story progresses too slowly with that little amount.",
        "The game has me hooked. I'm big on reading so I fly through the 300 energies. I've spent $10 repeatedly, even $20 for energy and it feels like it was gone in the same amount of time as the 300 energies. If you allowed maybe 4 refills a day, it would be amazing, or some other way, maybe to just keep playing the minigame. There has to be something more other than 20 energies for a video once a day. But despite the lack of energy, this game has me so disgustingly hooked. I love it so much.",
        "I think this game is really good. I just have one problem. Even though it says my energy is full, it feels like I have nothing. And also the mini game 100 energy seems to last longer than the initial 300 you receive. If you could fix this taht would be great. And if it's designed like this can you make energy spending more efficient?",
        "This game really addictive!! The only problem is they don't give you enough energy.😒you either have to buy energy or play a mini game to get more energy. The highest energy points that you can get is 100. Plus the 30 points if you watch a video. Other than that the game is AMAZING. The graphics are realistic. It has a lot of romance too. You should definitely download this game if you're not bothered about the energy points."

        "I was writing about an issue today, and with next time I have looked to see if the issue is resolved, it was.  Thank you for this amazing and wonderful game.  I had been playing this game for almost 4-5 years already.  With my issues being resolved I would say I love this game so much.  Much recommended.  😘",
        "I have waited 30min to see the gameplay after started the game. Very confusing.Bla bla, shiny things all arround, see this, take those, listen to the story and chose your 120lvl character. What is the point for new players to start from 120 lvl? How this can be fun?But never mind, I never understood the games which do that. Sorry, but I didnt find this game interesting for me.",
        "Wow, what do I think? I think this game is all hype took 4hrs plus change to download the game after installing it so to even play it was a joke, then when I finally was able, it froze on the log in screen and took me back out to my home page on my phone screen, only to then tell me the game had not been installed!!! Yeah clearly it is as it's taken up space! Not very good I'm not happy, I will try again before uninstalling this game if I manage to get in the game, obviously the review will change get but until then it's 1 star ass I can not go any lower. Sorry game makers!",
        "I wonder if there will be transcended busters in the future. Or perhaps the current arch buster will be the 'warrior' type and there will 1 of each type for us to mount. Looking forward to the overlord release though!",
        "Love the game been playing for over 2 1/2 years. Only one probably lately and that is my WB scores have been down substantially along with other users. I dont understand how going from a few archs' to having 6 and new gear makes my score down 14 trillion? Im bot the only one this is happening to so im a bit confused on what the problem is. Other than that great game play it everyday. Just dont like losing rewards on my wb% when it should be higher.",
        "After massive update and huge changes, I have to change my rating from 2 to 5.Such a big improvement toward all player,either f2p or whales.Congrats Gamevil, hopefully the community will grow as we see now in this game itself."

        "This game is quite good. The graphics are pretty nice for a kid's game, and I do appreciate how there are vents to win power up. That is a very nice update. It seems like Disney took the kids element a little more into consideration.  The later stages do get understandable harder. But after the 100th stage is almost impossible for kid's standerard, but I don't mind it since other games do the same thing.",
        "The game WAS great..spin the wheel, watch an ad, get a gameplay reward.  Great. But OMG now there's an BETWEEN squares AND for  rewards??!!! After you refused to give me back lost features  & said \"Disney had NO INTENTION of doing that in the future\", I had to think whether to uninstall the game, or suck it up & gimp along. Think you guys made the decision for. Too bad, I really enjoyed the game. Thx for what USED TO BE fun.",
        "This may not mean much to most. After suffering from a head injury, my memory was terrible. Level 250, memory coming back strong. I play daily on 2 devices. Just wish you could win gems, you have  to buy them except 22 in beginning. All in all 3-4 stars.",
        "I love love love this game!  BUT....THE ONLY THING I HATE IS THAT YOU CANNOT SAVE YOUR PROGRESS...IVE HAD TO REINSTALL THIS GAME 3x's AND LOST ALL PROGRESS! Maybe if i wasn't on level 280 it wouldn't be an issue! You should have this as a feature by now! UGH! 😠😭",
        "Impossible to save or synchronize progress! As mentioned in many other reviews, it is not possible to save game progress, even if you link to your Facebook account. App support website confirms this functionality is simply not supported. Absolutely unbelievable. Just unbelievable. Don't waste your time on this game - it really will be _wasted_ time.",
        "This is a great game and you can have fun for hours. I'd rate it 5 stars if a few things were changed. First, you need to be able to sync on other devices, especially if connecting to Facebook. I have other games that sync, no reason why this game can't get with that technology. Just got a new phone, was at level 346, and now have to start over on new phone. Luckily old phone will still be used. Second, it's impossible to earn gems. There should be special events to earn gems. Yes, you can spin to win, but the odds aren't in your favor to earn them. Third, there should be more opportunities to earn helps. The event to pass 5 levels is extremely difficult and there aren't many other opportunities to earn helps. I'm not spending money on this game. Take tips from Farm Heroes! Overall, this is a fun game and the graphics are cute."

Particularly like going back to this title every now and again for a no-pressure, casual simulation game. Surprisingly, Game Dev Tycoon is pretty smooth on mobile, so kudos to the devs!",
        "Just gave this game 5 star everything. When this game first came out on PC I couldn't afford it, so I pirated it. Sorry Greenheart! Now I have the chance to purchase your game and I'm glad I have. I know I'm going to play this for hours on end. It is definitely the best indie game I've ever played. Looking forward to your next project Greenheart!!",
        "Loving the game! Not sure where else to try to contact the devs, but I am having an issue. My auto save is from Year 15. I am currently in year 22, and so is my manual save. However, whenever I try to load my manual save, it only takes me back to the year 15 autosave. I know it's just a game but it's pretty upsetting to not be able to access that lost progress, so any tips or response would be awesome. Great game!",
        "It's good. 80 hours on PC version. This has some extra bits. Just want to support Dev, but am looking forward to playing it more on phone. Haven't had a bug yet either. Controls are great, they really lended themselves to mobile!",
        "Played for days on the PC version. This one is just like it, except in the palm of your hands. No micro transactions, coins, or loot boxes. One price for the full game. Amazing!  In Game Dev Tycoon, you make games and build a company to from your parents garage, to a fully fledged AAA Studio. The controls are awesome. Your first games will be tests to how and what gamers like. You'll develop games for real life hardware (with names changed for licensing issues). Eventually, when you get to late game, you can create your own console and compete with other companies, releasing exclusive titles of your own, and dominating the market share.   You'll easily lose if you're not careful with your finances, but the game is so addicting that you'll keep coming back to it. Like I did.",

        "This game should be avoided. They don't care about what the players think and refuse to make improvements or adjustment players suggest. Progress is slow and even if you spend real money your odds of getting what you want is low.  Avoid starting at a costs. It is not worth your time.",
        "It is impossible to have a good team without spending lots of money.  In order to have a good team you need 4 star level robots which even when you do get a chance to get one, you will end up with a duplicate which will be liquidated for just about nothing. Hence better players get better and lower level players stay at the bottom. Also players that spend alot tend to get better chances on draws that are supposed to be random. Wow that's a surprise",
        "This game is a lot of fun. Great time killer. The only thing I think could be improve is the fact that you can't upgrade your bots with duplicates you get in the space bridge. And possibly better mechanics to see the bots you have walking around your base. Other than that. It's amazing.",
        "Slow, VERY SLOW You have to wait for everything.  After each battle, the Autobots need 7 minutes to recover for the next battle, but I have enough fuel for battle.  And, as your robots get more stars, the more you have to wait.  So it is about 20 minutes per game for me. Slow  Then if you accidentally switch to another apps or shut the screen off for a second, you will have to wait for the game to reload for another 2 or 3 minutes.  slow  Graphics is beautiful, but story suck, and wait time is horrible",
        "Updated. Games are supposed to be fun, if u play this game be prepared for a complete lack of respect for its user Base from the devs and a lack of fun events. Even those spending 1000s are bored  Don't start spending as the game is dying Don't expect good support from the game makers either who seem to be on a mission to put off it's older users to the point of stopping them playing the game. Ps dont expect many players as a deception. Pps #saveferal",
        "First off, if you do not want duplicates, do _not_ spend any money on anything other than maybe another builder bot and don't waste any of your cyber coins on crystals until you get all of your builder bots.   So long as you don't care about getting dupes the game is fun. And you will get so very many many many dupes, often times the same bot in a row. Fortunately, the somewhat new cores help take away the pain of getting dupes.  Personally, I enjoy the strategic and alliance parts of this game a lot and the events are fun so long as you don't care about placement on the leaderboard. Having a good alliance helps a lot by the way. Don't be afraid to look around for ones that boot leaches."

I didn't give it a 5 stars because of some of the programing actions available. The waypoints are sometimes more trouble than they are worth. The programmation is limited to 24 hrs. A ruler would be very useful for projections over 24 hrs. But I am enjoying myself, even if my wife doesn't understand why I should wake up at 4 am to check my course.",

Please look to make driving dial a bit larger, and a bit less sensitive, and possibly a 1 degree up or down feature, like the arrows  but a +1 or minus 1, as feature on present dial is too sensitive and does not adjust so refined.  From a Canadian point of view, can you look to include some races like Vic-maui, Transpac or even more amazing and local to west coast of North America, races such as Swiftsure or Southern Straights... short but very technically sweet races that are very challenging.",

I only have 200 coins daily, thus it isn't for buying songs, it's for just playing them. This update is a money-baiter. I got to say, this game really took a lot of work to Ubisoft and who am I to critize it. But I think that they should let us buy the songs. This game is really cool btw",

This actually isn't valid as I just looked at each option to buy and none give the option of no ads. Plus I've made purchases and still nothing. I just updated the app and received the option of no ads. I clicked it and paid to no avail. Email has already been sent about it.",
        "I really love this game. I downloaded it for mindless stress relief in between classes and it has not disappointed. Some of the levels are really tricky, I think in an attempt to get you to buy more balls. But that's not too much of a complaint. I bought the full version and it's worth it to be add free.",
        "Hi there! I love this game! Im on level1839 and my hubby says i have a problem bahaha. The only thing ive noticed is the levels seem to have stopped introducing challenges and are sometimes just not possible to beat without serious coin. But that doesn't mean I plan to stop anytime soon hahaha.",
        "It's an ok bubble blaster game, it has a lot of pop up ads. When you beat one level and move to the next there is always a 15 sec video. If your not on WiFi this will drag at your data",
        "While its addicting its quite easy. I've gotten 3 stars on every level and I've played over 200 levels already. Ive only had to replay a level that failed 3 or 4 times.",
        "This was fun... Until level 100 when they take away the ability to switch colors of the ball you're shooting. It makes it too difficult. I'm missing clearing it by one ball each time so then I'm watching ad after ad to avoid restarting the level. It's really disappointing how much that one thing has made me abandon the game and uninstall."

        "Amazing game!! I have purchased 1 or 2 bikes already, I would even pay to get new bikes, but it is very expensive. Please consider lowering to prices or making better bikes more accessible. Ive been stuck on the same level for 5 weeks. I want to continue playing but im loosing intrest not being able to advance. Maybe you could trade your old bikes in to get something in return for a newer bike. Im sure you will never read this, but you do have something special here! Thanks",
        "Very fun BMX pump game. Seen a few reviews say it's gets impossible after level 3 when it becomes pay to win. I don't agree I've just reached level 8 in a few hours. If you ride bikes off road and understand how to pump you'll love it",
        "Its way to hard to win and and the stats do nothing.  You have to be perfect and even then they fly by.  Still LOVE this game.  Just takes away the fun when you get left in the dust and you play the same lvl a million times hoping maybe one time you will be perfect.",
        "I loved this game for 3 days. Then it got to the point where I couldn't beat a level without upgrading my bike, but I couldn't upgrade my bike without spending real money. So disappointing. Don't waste your time if you don't want to spend real money!",
        "The game is fun up until around the third level. After that it becomes near impossible to win any races without spending actual money to upgrade your bike. Had a lot of fun with it up until that point, but it's definitely not worth spending actual money on. Deleted the game after pay to win clearly became a necessity.",
        "It was fun for a while - until it becomes impossible to beat any opponents with your current bike. The difficulty spikes around level 7 and the process of buying a new bike or upgrading your existing one becomes very frustrating, as you can't win any races to earn any money."

However, it was too difficult to earn the in game currency. Perhaps you could add in a video where the players are able to earn gems? Even if it's only once it twice a day, I'm sure it'll definitely help. All in all though, this was a great game as usual. Keep up the good work!",
        "I've been obsessed with Sherlock Holmes since I was about 7. Every incarnation of him, be it the books, the TV show or even the anime has left me completely in awe of Sherlock.  So I'm sad to say that I feel this falls short. As it's own game, it's great. I love the story and the characters are well developed. However, I went into it with a certain idea of how Sherlock should act, and it's not what I got. I understand why though, and it's not too distracting from the game. With that being said, I thoroughly enjoyed myself. The puzzles were a fun mechanic (a little easy for my liking, but still enjoyable) and the art style is really pleasing. Overall, I do think it's a game worth downloading.",
        "I really love it. Just like the other \"shall we date\" games you guys made. However, twice already did i not get my free SH points after doing the required action for it. Is there anything for that? Also if you guys are into the idea, you can do a free small amount of gems for watching an advertisement once every day or something? All the rest in the games you guys make is awesome and i love em all.",
        "The best Shall We Date game by far.  The characters are funny,  especially Sherlock and I love the plots.  If you can make Sebastian,  Jack, Hercule,  Jeremy and even Lestrade's routes it would be SUPER appreciated.  Omg, I think Lestrade's route would be the funniest because ALL of them would rip and mock him.  😂  Update: I still think it's the best one.",
        "I just have to say: I love that the MC is not the usual cheerful idiot that somehow makes every guy fawn over her even though she can barely string a sentence together. This MC is portrayed as witty and intellegent as well as beautiful.  All the guys are also intellegent and quirky.  The stories are well written AND well edited. I never have trouble figuring out the plot due to poor grammar or translations.",
        "Great game, I think it's the best game shall we date had. Female lead is independent woman who doesn't make me wonder why everyone likes her. Guys are great as well, plus I absolutely the writing. It's probably the only game were I was bothered to play more than 3 routes"

        "Its a fun game. Still feel forced in the beginning to buy because ofbhow challenging and tough it is. But I think thats what I like about it; challenge.  but its a great game. Probably my favourite TF game. Hope to have new levels come out soon. Maybe another 100 or so? ;)  Update: I recently had to nuy a new phone. I thought meh, and started over again, but then I thought about it and I cant seem to find a way to recover my previous progression. It shows it in achievements but can not actually srart where I finished. Is there a way to do so? Thanks for the help.",
        "Pretty fun. Some levels are very hard and it is no so obvious how to win. VERY different than 1 and 2 where there was a clear logical way to win. Tournament level: I like the idea but some levels are sooooo hard I have no clue how to beat it! Overall fun and challenging!",
        "Freemium Alert!! The game itself is great. Until you get to around level 5 on the upgrades. Instead of coins, you start having to pay with crystals. This is where you have to start paying with real money to get crystals, to then get any further. Disappointing that you can't complete this with paying to win. Now feels like a waste of time.",
        "I got to the point where I couldn't move forward anymore without upgrades. I can do the tournaments to get items for upgrades but the tournaments were the same every week. Then BAM! They changed up the tournament for me and made it more challenging.  I love this game!",
        "I played this before a few years ago, have reinstalled and now it looks different but the same style.  However there are now now skull heads that instantly destroy your towers and you cant seem to avoid that.  The towers get knocked back for energy quicker than before as well.  The skull heads are the killer though as makes it impossible to win.",
        "Is a typical tower defense game... Bit. easier to learn and has it's own unique system for tower leveling... plus watch videos to earn points for the game got stuck and could not beat any of levels up for me top play.. restarted"

        "Some issues, but excellent game play overall.",
        "It just keeps freezing so you can't really play it. Whenever I want a duel or whatever race it never loads...too bad cause it looks like nice game.",
        "Is fun when it loads or is not crashing. The skills and stat points seem useless. Can be lvl 5 in skills and 10 points higher in stats than opponent and still lose with no misses in race.",
        "It keeps freezing and shutting down. It's fun if you can play it. But whenever I duel, the app freezes and quits on you",
        "Such a bias game towards biathlon. Use normal questions, not just biathlon. Just a Nordic game. No interest for people from other countries."

        "I had to change my rating for this game because I seriously believe it is rigged for me to stop advancing. Everything was great until I made it to pro level and now I'm noticing that whenever I am tied with another player with gems, an extra gem magically appears in the hole making me lose that round. How is it possible that I made it to pro level winning a good percentage of games and now I have played at least 50 rounds on level 3 and can't win a single one?",
        "A great app to download. Great format and graphics. Lots of fun and challenging. Rated everything 5 star other than gameplay. It's good but not great due to the water hazard or out of bounds shots.  Players can hit into the water yet still finish on par. Water hazard should automatically be 2 shots. If this gets changed it would be 5 star no doubt and best golf app.  Single mode would be fantastic to practise",
        "To many play just to attack your ball after you hit. Regardless if they don't play well they win. A bit eh. The way it's done barely allows you to win. I agree with many others reviews. Something fishy about the scoring system and who you are placed against. Won't keep long if it continues. Could be awesome if it wasn't unfair. O.o",
        "This game is ok at best. More about luck then skill. Fun and addictive, yes at times. Ive collected all the trophies from 3 of the maps and was on a roll. Then out of nowhere a 15 game lose streak. You will get to the point past anger. There are a lot of pretty good/lucky players from around the world.",
        "Overall, game quality is pretty solid. Few graphic glitches here and there but can be expected. It would be nice to rotate to see a better perspective and easier to hit.   One must improvement needed is that when you play a bot, it's way too noticable. You need to improve the bot intelligence! I understand why bots would be needed time to time.  Coins could be cheaper too.  EDIT: Game froze on a Pixel XL, cost me lots of coins! Not happy.",
        "Not bad. Sometimes freezes a little during game play but usually resolved itself. The wind is usually fair for each player's turn so that's good. Overall a good little time waster game. The only thing I would suggest is to make it a little easier/more often that gold bricks get collected. I've played for over a month now and got about 8 since starting."

But unless you're willing to pay you have to wait for quite a while to get to play again. All of the Criminal Case games are the same way. Never been so blown away by a game insisting on paying money like this before. Very disappointed!",
        "Great gameplay. Colorful and vivid graphics. Smooth gameplay on LG Aristo 2. Been playing this a long time, took a break and came back. Why am I seeing Ads every minute in the game now ?!?!? I've never had that issue before at all. Now its Ads every minute !!",
        "Getting less fun than ever.  Pop up adverts in game very irritating.  Reported glitches in game to get response to follow self help which i already did.  Constantly bombarded by attempts to get you to spend money.     Used to be a great game by now would not recommend.  Will stop when i complete in 6 levels",
        "this game is so addicting. the only thing I hate is that they don't reward energy anymore. No drinks etc. I just wish you didn't have to buy energy to continue . otherwise I love this game. it's a great time consumer when you are borwd",
        "I played this game for a VERY long time. Recently, the creators have made lousy changes, making it difficult to get energy to play and giving us adults some stupid, useless stickers. Most of the regular players feel the changes are to force us to buy energy. Instead, many people are leaving the game, which is very unfortunate. Advertisers take notice! The creators aren't listening to the players and you may want to seriously consider before investing in this game."

Also developers never responded to my email regarding something else. I've spent $40 bucks on this game in the 1st few days I've been playing and I think I'll keep my lil money to myself now since they haven't fixed the issue.",

You still can't get enough fire logs plus still no radio toy for the bear? Plus should give more coins it is a lot in higher levels",

Its a super fun game but so hard to get anywhere. You should be able to stock up shields. Also its stupid that you have to pay to talk. I might get the VIP if some things changed.",

        "This game is so much fun. Enjoyable, challenging and addicting. However the only problem with the game is the fact that in order to play the levels, you have to collect enough tokens to unlock them. Now this is fine, if there is something else to do in the game. But there isn't. You have to wait real time in order to play anything of the game. And there is no option to watch a video to gain 10 tokens. It straight up only allows you to buy tokens with actual currency. Micro transactions can be used as long as there is a way to play the game without them. But apart from that minor flaw. I cannot recommend the game enough as it's a challenging blast. Just a shame about the tokens.",
        "A fun game overall, but there are way too many ads. You can remove ads with a micro-transaction of buying tokens or coins, but I refuse to do that as I have more coins than I need as it is. As others have noted, it would be nice if your time-replenished tokens count was more than 10, as many puzzles cost more than 10 tokens to play. You can spend coins to replay a level and get more tokens, and there is a \"super-hard\" level in the main puzzle that is actually pretty easy and awards 3 tokens.",
        "Brilliant game and the only one I have found that doesn't auto fill the 'x' as you play. Perfect. However, as you progress the chance to get tokens reduces as the cost of each level goes up which means it takes days to get enough from daily bonus to play one level.  Pay wall doesn't pay out so waste of time. Very disappointing.",
        "The game is truly fun. Can't play very long because the tokens don't regenerate fast enough. I was winning tokens on some levels but since I purchased some tokens I haven't won a single one. Now that the tokens I paid for are gone I'm still not winning tokens (only coins, but it requires tokens to open the levels) so it's back to not being able to play very long",
        "This game was great untill it became unplayable. Every level or square on the puzzle needs to be unlocked with tokens. As you go through the game all levels start costing more and more tokens. At the start around 4 tokens per lv now after 234 puzzles 16 tokens. That is total b.s. so at best I can play a single game a day. So only play if your not planning on finishing or playing them a lot of money.",
        "The cells are too small to click on without accidently pressing the surrounding squares. Also, on the Galaxt S8 with the curved screen, the edge of the playing grid goes too far over the side of the phone, making it impossible to click on any of the cells in the last column."

No explanations on some features, you have to figure it out by trial and error wasting resources. I'm at castle level 15, dragon level makes no difference so far only troop level does. Events are useless because the top spenders take everything before you can even find the location. Misleading descriptions in-game costing you resources. This is utter BS and far from anything tactical as advertised. Drains battery faster than any app/game I've ever encountered",

        "With daily events and online 3v3 matches; not to mention the addicitve meat farm and egg hatching. It's another GREAT game for the digimon fans, both new and old, to enjoy!   On a side note: I do wish they would add abit more to/continue the \"story mode\" but add abit of a cpu challenge to it.",
        "I love this game, I've been on almost everyday. It looks great, there are many Digivolution paths to take, and battling is a ton of fun. My only real complaint is the chat.. my friend and I use a private chat to talk all the time while waiting for stamina to recharge, but it's pretty buggy, censoring a lot of really common, non offensive words like anything with an \"ho\" or \"is\", and for some reason the word \"ready\" is censored too.. if this could be fixed, it would be great.",
        "It's a good game, really easy to play and yoy get the hang off it but one of my biggest complaint is the grind! The whole game is about grinding to get good digimon but the drop rates are so freaking low! The game would be more enjoyable if the rates were higher. I don't want to be spending so much time for me to save up stamina just for me to use it in seconds and get nothing. Hopefully they change it if not then this game is probably going to be forgotten soon",
        "Great works. As a big fan im really looking forward if Bandai can also bring back the classic old school dot digivice game into modern one. Not mmorpg.. But just that classic nostalgic dot nostalgic game. I really like digimon unlimited that a fan made before where we raise one digimon in many ways. Too bad its not bandai work. I definitely play if u make one",
        "The games is really fun and i love how the systems work. There are some issues however, for example WAY WAY WAY too grindy. Thats the biggest because during events you have to commit your life to the game to progress your gamestate. Additionally if you use stones in someone else's hosted co-op game they're gone despite it not being your fault and with the tiny amount of stones you get after 3 10 captures it adds up. Needs reworks but is good over all.",
        "Most people will say that it is kinda hard to get to mega. And I think they got a point but well in my own oppinion, this game comes with its own strength and weakness. I manage to get my rosemon and wargreymon and now I'm working on my taomon. My point is. This game is good overall but it can be better if there are feature that we can do to enhance our interaction with other player. A clan or guild or something like that. Keep ap the good work and I'm looking forward to the next update."

If it requires spending money I don't have in order to go further into the game, it too will be uninstalled and I will lower the star rating.",

You can only buy hammers with gold which you only get TEN pieces per level no matter WHAT you score OR how many stars you get. And theres a lot of ads. Every time you you play a level.",

        "Awesome game, awesome graphics and gameplay! Controls I rated four stars due to sluggish firing it seems....or...it could be my device too. Im not exactly sure. Also, not a deal breaker, could we shut off the verbal commentary during battle and keep the sound effects? That'd be awesome. Great game all around though.",
        "When I first started playing this game a while ago it was great. Alot of fun. But after every update it gets less enjoyable. Originally gave it 5 stars but I honestly can't agree to that any more. Especially with the tokens and duplicate planes. I have no reason to spend any money, the tokens are useless and after 18 duplicate planes I just won't buy crates. Not worth it.",
        "Game is a POS. They used to work pretty well then they started upgrading everything and now it doesn't work hardly at all. Massive disconnects tons of unplayable lag. So far the only thing I found that works well in this game is the buy me button.. they don't seem to have a problem with that part of the game it works very well the rest of the game sucks.!",
        "I like this game, its the best WW2 Airfight game. I play many WW2 Airfight game in android, but this is the best one. Good Job War Wings. Can you make more than 4 vs 4 or 8 vs 8 in big map or something more than 4 vs 4? It will be look like war games not PVP, just advice. Keep the good work.",
        "The game is great but the enemy planes should have a health bar or something like that. You could also introduce clouds where there is almost no visibility and some power ups based on experience pts of a plane.. But still a really nice game"

        "Not bad at all! Awesome strategy game , it's all on how you decide to use your  resources (diamonds) . Don't even have to Recharge much and still move up in ranks & power. Got hooked on it more than Coc.😃😀🖒🖒",
        "You guys might want to consider making occasional, if not regular update for the game, especially on the events. At least keep up with the regular, basic ones. It was enjoyable. Missed the old days even tho so many changed drastically for good or for worst. The difficulty in everything is not really bothersome but if the minor rewards are slightly helpful, they could bring a fortune to you guys and us, players. Conclusion, please give us what we deserves 😊",
        "Great game but when i tried to use gems for instant research it didnt work and spent my gems and i tried to do it about 3 or 4 times and it spent all my gems without doing anything. I tried reopening the app and i tried resetting my phone too, to see if it was just a glitch. Please do something about this. I would like my gems back",
        "Used to be a decent game. The game developers have basically abandoned it and only use it to get cash on the side. No game updates for months. Small problems have been popping up now and then. Not worth the time, the game's just going downhill from here",
        "Too brutal and hardcore for new players. 100 times more powerfull players attack your base when you level up to lvl 6. You loose all you troops and you don't have food to develope new troops and it takes forever to get enough food and train new forces. And you are attacked again and so on. Unistalled game right after that. Alliance is no help.  They have copied whole game from the Zgirls game. Just a little different graphics",
        "Loved the game, except for the bi-weekly slaughter fest, until they stopped updating the game and stopped supporting the players. Spent money to upgrade the bank, but it keeps reverting back to level 0. Been trying to get it unlocked for weeks, but support doesn't respond. Don't waste your time and especially don't put any money into the game!"

Example: upgrading fridge, adding order to telephone system. The button can easily clicked and cause the time spent to earn cash gone within seconds. Thanks.",
        "I love this game it serves us my boredom reliever. I love the graphics the design and all. My complain is only about the vouchers and the expansion problem Can u please give us lot of expansion voucher bcoz i always use my cash to expand my cafe. U know that it is very hard to earn a cash. And can you lower the prices of avatar like 50 cash only bcoz 100 cash is too much.  Thank you i hope you can consider my request",
        "Amazingly fun and addicting! But really needs a confirmation button for spending cash (\"Are you sure you'd like to spend X cash?\") There are buttons everywhere and I've already wasted so much cash by pure accident. That's my only complaint though :)",

That is the reason I will probably quit it. :( If you dont start spending money it will be really hard to expand, you wont be able to build machines and that is the reason customers will leave negative comments... And some of the coments you get from customers are really mean and offensive... I wish they were more subtle. The prizes you can win by watching ads and inviting celebrities over are usually not helpful and dont change the situation that much. Like I said, you MUST spend money to enjoy the game. It is a great option for those who have money to throw away on frivoulus things...",
        "Game is fun, but its hard to get all that the game has to offer without spending some real money.  Not sure if I'm going to continue"

Upgrades cost a fortune and collecting boxes are few and far between and earning cash with off-road challenges is just a drop in the bucket of money you'll need for an upgrade. I'm not saying everything should be cheap and easy, but should increase cash values or offer other ways to earn cash.",

And the camera (free camera) followed the truck perfectly in order to see the suspension moving with the terain. Now the camera does not stay where you want it. Now it moves out of place in (free camera) because it touches rocks, trees etc. Physics have become so fake. Please change back the camara and physics. I unistalled other games because this is all I spent time with. But now I dont know?",
        "nice! im waiting for long time for the game like this... and this is it. but, please add more common truck like nissan navara, toyota hilux vigo & revo, mitsubishi triton, ford ranger 3.2, isuzu dmax.. and also please fix the mud graphic to more realistic.. thanks..",
        "Hey devs, great game, I think a winter map or just more maps would be awesome as well as an option to sell vehicles rather than just collect them. Overall I gave everything but the controls 5 stars becuase id like to see custom placement of things like the gas, break, shifter, etc. Great job overall",
        "This game suck because it never work it always lags out and every time it says loading trailer it goes back to my home screen. In my review i mean all of this and hope ypu make your game better so it doesn't suck but for now it does suck.",
        "This game is literally what I have been looking for. This is the perfect offroad game. I just wish that there were A LOT more maps and vehicles to chose from. It's boring to constantly go to the same maps. Also the multiplayer is pretty fun. Expand the maps and create new ones please!"

        "One of the best sports games available on the market right now. The graphics are awesome. And the player realism is good. The challenge of acquiring Elite Players keeps you going.    EDIT: This game is a perfect example of how not to screw up a top notch game. Used to love it to death before the update, now every aspect of the game has been worsened; Auctions, Gameplay, Teams. Just name a feature and you can be sure that it's been screwed up. Just hope they resolve this the next year. Will just uninstall till the new yearly reset.",
        "YO IS IT ME OR BEFORE THE UPDATE I HAD CHOICES TO PICK BETWEEN 5 TEAMS I WORK SO HARD TO BUILD? DEFENSIVE LINE UP, SHOOTING LINE UP, AND SO ON. Listen Whoever made the game. I know what type of tricks u tryna do ok. I'm smart enough to know. And I know what y'all doing with that MONEY. So I would appreciate it  if I can use my teams again✌",
        "I can't see myself EVER giving EA mobile games anything but a 1 star rating, the game is geared to cheat unless you're spending actual $ on paccs & players. How many times can an event rob you of stamina to only rob you again by redundantly giving you the same fucc'n collectables over & over & over again!!! By the time you actually complete the set either the seasons over, or there's better players @ the position that you'll probably never end up getting either... Unless you spend some cash. EA succs man, SINCERELY!!!",
        "I think i'm dissatisfied with this game of rule. You should change this rule... when the all people can feel comfortable, and can be feel happy, free and enjoy it. This is so very very bad news with you EA. If you still use this rule, i think... this game can be game over forever. You should back this rule like before. if you can't, everymonts, weeks, days, hours, or minutes, this rating of Nbalivemobile always down, decrease, and fall, hopefully you can understand if you feel this game very important for you! Trust me!. Thank you. Tru",
        "EA, the game is official and is above average as far as graphics, gameplay go etc. etc. but food for thought and I think it'll be a gamechanger really...it'll take the game to new heights on a consumer level. It's the only thing missing aka Commentators/commentary as part of the in-game gameplay and the rest will speak for itself. 🔦"

        "The game is fun to play casually. Just open it up a few times a day and level up the heroes or whatever. Now whenever I open the app, it functions the same except the graphics are glitched out. Some icons are missing completely. It is making me not want to play it as often. Wish I knew what to do to fix it. Tried reinstalling it, and that fixed it for a few hours.",
        "The game itself is fun, but there are two major bugs I ran into that ruined the gameplay:  1. Starting at zone 500, some of the idle ancients stop working entirely. Then when you reset after reaching 500, they continue to not work even at earlier waves. Incredibly disappointing.   2. When I spent 500 rubies to activate the \"double damage permanently,\" it immediately and permanently reduced my damage output 10x. Ruined all my progress and wasted my rubies.  Fix those two things and you've got yourself an excellent game.",
        "I'd give five stars except for a serious bug after about zone 130. The idea is that your heroes fight for you while your away, so you progress a bit while you're not actually playing. That's the nature of clicker games. This works as expected before zone 130, but after 130 it glitches a lot, removing a lot of your current progress.   It seems to only remember cleared zones, but not the progress within zones. For example, if I'm on zone 181 and it's moving at a rate where it looks like it would clear the zone after 20 minutes, it will reset the zone to zero if I open the app before that. Oddly, it still pays out the gold, but the progress is lost.",
        "It's really nice not too laggy at all. You get new characters all the time to help tour team and upgrade them. And it's very fun to get a boss so much gold and if your away for 2 days for example you wold come back and the monsters would keep dieing.",
        "Use to play it years ago, tryed it again now. Transcend and that Ponyboy really ruined the game I think. Progression is oversimplified and lightning fast to a point it doesn't feel fun for me at all. There is one build that is way to obvious and better then anything else.",
