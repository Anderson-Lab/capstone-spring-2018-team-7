        "Thank you Bluehole and Tencent for making the best mobile game I have ever played. I tried the PUBG mobile clones before this official version was released and I must say I'm extremely impressed with the entire experience. This is as close to a console or PC game as you are going to get. Superb graphics, easy to figure out and implement controls, the ultimate battle royal game for mobile. I have never loved a mobile game so much. There is a reason this is a 700mb download. This Game is 5 stars across the board. PUBG for mobile is EPIC.",
        "The gameplay is so great so far! There are stil a lot of bugs though, like mic doesn't work sometimes, aim and reloaded ui is gone, and I don't know if it's my phone but when I use 8x scope, the frame rate drops; like a lot. Hopefully the game will get fixed, and get optimized for low spec phones on a further update, oh and also a suggestion make the hud mini map a little bit big and also make the map itself hd. Anyway you guys still did a great job and thank you for this! :)",
        "I think this game is really good compared to the Xbox and PC versions of the game. It also adds a few other options for the game that aren't on the PC/Xbox version such as distance from your marker, dotted line to your marker, and it tells you how many poeple are in the plane. The aim assist really helps balance out the phone controls to keep gun fights running smooth and everything works really well. There is the occasional lag spike and stuff but the game works really well for my 2 year old Samsung  tablet.  10 out of 10 would recommend.",
        "Umm i loved this game on my pc but on mobile I belive there are some serious optimisation needed I am using a Samsung j7 prime and it can't run this game on low too. Means are you guys serious? You wrote that it works on Redmi 4a having a much less specs as compered to j7 I know its a samsung phone but we can expect a smooth experience at low setting I will change my rating once I get a smooth experience. Hope you fix it soon",
        "Nvrmind I'm starting to understand this game. It's not bad but could be a lot better. Still say u should get to keep wat u find. Unlocking is kool but should be only for better than basic gear. Just my opinion. Guns and melee weapons it's understandable to have to find them over again each game but the clothing I just don't understand y I gotta be naked unless I unlock crates to get clothes. Weird really.",
        "It is a super good game. Probably the best from all other battleground games, even fortnite. You guys should put a game mode where teams of 4 can conqure land on the map. And once a person dies they cant respond. Put checkpoints all across the map to be able to claim a section of the map. The only way to win is by eliminating every enemy or taking all the land. This mode will change the game play of pubg and will be another unique thing compared to fortnite. It is also something new and very interesting. Please take this into consideration."

Overall, good job.(Edit**) Great job on the addition of new content with the last update, however with this latest update the game will glitch. The glitch makes the ball not land and resets the game to the pitching of the ball.",
        "I liked the game before. I did pay to remove ads. The game was simple and fun. However the current update has the game broken. The ability to get new characters is a nice addition but the game at higher levels is unplayable. The game keeps resetting because the ball is hit so hard and high it goes out of the playable area even if you hit it \"perfect\" once this issue is fixed I will adjust my review",
        "Fun off the bat... But then it slows down to a brutal snails pace. It's a great concept, it just needs a lot more updates!  *Slow claps* great work on the \"updates\". I shouldn't have updates in parenthesis.. The characters are cool, leveling is also a cool touch, and a whopping 7 new bats? Killing it!..? But come on, way to go extreme overboard on the speed! All the other bad reviews cover it better. I just wanted to also sarcastically congratulate your update.",
        "pretty good game, glad they're updating it and adding in more bats. I play it when I'm waiting at the airport. the new update sped things up, made it really buggy. resets your hits at 44000 M and isn't really playable at this point, hopefully it's fixed soon",
        "Latest update totally destroyed the game. Even using the basic bat hitting it perfectly straight it takes the ball 2 seconds to fly 100,000 meters and then the game resets back to swing again. Without even getting to actually make any currency for upgrades",
        "UPDATE: Every time I hit, the game resets it's self. I hit the ball the meters get up above 80k and then the screen goes black and then I'm back at the plate.   Any upgrades coming soon? I have all the bats and am over 30,000 meters. Need some more upgrades."

        "Could be better. I dont like the fact that anyone can just waltz up to you and come in your house. There should be a setting that allows you to keep your house and sims private from other people. Also its a bit weird that if you tap on any sim without talking to them, they come into your house and do whatever they like without permission, even if you have a bad relationship with them. And it would also be nice if doors could be locked.",
        "It's fun so far! Can't wait to play more and see what else is in store! P.S. the sims, I wish they would not go off on their own and make doubles. Like if you want to make it a real life interaction type style, you should probably fix it to where the actions are more real and not computerized. I would like the option to do more with my kid sims, like more clothes options.  I also dont like the fact that when your sim retires, yoy no longer have control over them. Yhat jind of sucks. Alot...but Keep up the good work. Thanks!",
        "After playing for three days, this doesn't feel like a Sims game, some actions and interactions with objects are meanless, why do I need to use the toilet? One of the key factors of the Sims is to fill their needs, what are the needs of these Sims? It doesn't care at all if I decide to not pursuing one of the stories with friends, hobbies or career. And where are their feelings? Their aspirations? If I follow two romantic stories,  those Sims don't seem to be jealous even if I'm dating them in the same room! This is a game for the money,  not to play a simulation.",
        "PLEASE  HELP!!!!! So i uninstalled and reinstalled the game in my phone but there is no prompt that ask me if i wanna continue my progress when i play it again and it seems that im link to my google play (bacause there is no option to link it in the settings) but i still start back from the very beginning. And didn't really recovered my previous game. Love everything except for this.  P.S. i did the troubleshooting in the forum but nothing really helps.",
        "Edit: I just had my latest infant boy \"evolve\". My question is, why did you all give me a caucasian kid when my family is black? My other 2 kids are black too! I don't mind (since he's here lol) but this is odd.     I love this game! Already have 2 kiddos and a big house!",
        "So after about a week of gameplay there are some things that I think can be improved upon. I understand this is not the computer version so automated actions are probably not going to be included. I feel like when I'm done using a product such as getting married, I should be able to return those items and get at least half my money back. I noticed that when I'm deleting items I'm not getting anything back and then item is completely gone.   This review won't be all negative though. I really like how you can meet different people from different countries, and chat with them via parties. I think the ducky bucks function sucks. And while I can understand the effort that was made when creating all these different tickets, I think it's just too much"

        "Awesome update! Make the game worth again, when it seems Nintendo had abandoned Super Mario Run, they back and release more content for the half of the price. This is the kind of update I was waiting for, once I didn't paid the game yet, I think this could be a great time to purchase. Probably in the future they will release more content, but the price will back to 9.99, so the best time to purchase is now! Great job Nintendo, I love your games since my childhood.",
        "Was pretty short to begin with but Nintendo has supported this game well, adding additional content, even a new mode. The simplified game mechanics to fit Mario gaming on a phone work great and feel natural. The story with it's additional challenges to open new courses are fun, toad run is addictive, the remix 10 is somewhat redundant content wise but also good. I'd rather pay $10 up front than have in-game purchases, the reception to this game indicates that I'm very much in the minority on that. Great game, very fun for a quick session of Mario.",
        "Awesome and all, but you only get 4 levels for free. To go to world 2, WHY IN THE UNIVERSAL WORLD RIGHT HERE IN A CITY (lol😀) DO YOU HAVE TO BUY WORLD 2, 3, 4, 5, AND 6? TALK ABOUT A RIPOFF! 😞 (Warning to Nintendo: If you dont fix this soon, I'm deleting. Sorry!)",
        "I absolutely love this game. I make it a point to not spend money on mobile games cus they typically turn out to be a cash trap, but this was just like buying a regular video game. No adds, and even before buying the full game it doesn't shove \"buy our product\" notifications down your throat. Nintendo has always had good games and I have no doubts that I will keep playing this every day.",
        "Favorite game. It has a one time cost for full version and not a monthly fee or several different things you have to buy to enjoy it. I like the updates with the remix, and the star courses. I didnt like that there was so little to do before I bought it. I got bored quick. But was surprised by the cost, and love it after buying it. I do wish we could see our friends land and share things we don't need and give rally tickets to others.",
        "This is just proof Nintendo can make amazing games no matter the platform. All the bad reviews are people's mad you gotta pay for the game. Lol wut? It's a great time killer made  by the best gaming company in the world and you're mad it's not free? Funny. There's no IAP.  It's not pay to win. But it is the most fun 5$ will ever buy you."

        "Why is it difficult to get daily challenge without using data?  And one can't see other users scores without data. Can't that be possible at least for a week if one on it to her their records it shud be like that for the rest of the week. Most importantly  subway surfers consume too much data. But wen updating every month and for that reason I humbly demand that this game company provide physical cash reward for those who are consistent for us to tell others who are asking us who subway surfers help. If we tell them benefits we derive I bet u more people who are lover of games will wanna be part of subway. Trust  me....  Tnx in anticipation",

I tried repairing the game many times, reinstalled it too many times, but the same problem persists. Hope your team will look into the matter soon. Thank you!"

I therefore uninstall, only to find myself in no time at all missing the game...the challenge & reinstalling the app.  👍👍👍  Good job to the developers.",

Sudden barrage of loud commercials has ruined the experience. It has actually resulted in me playing less and therefore has had me watch less commercials. Go figure.",

        "It's a good game, but it makes ads randomly appear on your screen even when the app is closed. Let's say you're watching YouTube for a while. Eventually, an ad will pop up for no reason. This is the only quality that ruins the game. The app opening randomly to show ads. To the creators; that's not ok. ONLY have the ads appear IN GAME",
        "Fun game but even when my phone is on sleep mode, I get adds. If the game isn't open, I get adds from it. I look at my opened apps and there's the add under the game. It gets really annoying so I unistalled it. I do not sugest you download. I had music playing at it got interupted by a add, mind you that my phone was in sleep mode, and it scared me half to death cause all I heard was a roaring sound come from my phone.",
        "They put ads on your phone without the game even being open. I would be watching youtube with this app not even on and I would get a full screen ad.  Gameplay wise, it's a decent idea. The puzzles are very easy but the struggle of trying to initially move the ball is a little annoying. The graphics seem unfinished at some points (such as the level select) and it just overall seems empty and bland.",
        "One word ADS. The game doesn't even have to be open. I will be watching YouTube and the retarded ads pop up. While I was creating this there were already 3 ads.",
        "At first it really helped me relax and get on with my work but then one day while I was in a test an add on this app all of a sudden started playing even with my silent mode on and I had a detention for it I hope u can sort this out. If u do I would love to download this app again although it did annoy how every time I finished a round I would get an add straight away and that ment I didn't finish very many",
        "It was good but the game glitches and its WAY too easy. I, a 13 year old, finished in 1 and a half days. I thought it would ve harder, but it isn't. Also, only like 40 levels? It makes it easier. Only good if you want a quick, easy game."

Cues length and force controlled to games advantage even when reloaded. I had 6,991,000 and my win percentage was 61.3 and lost 1 million 5x in a row. How do I have a 61.3% chance of winning and lose so easily by these 40-50% players like nothing. If you don't actually buy stuff with actual money on app game will treat you poorly.",

The Irish and Indian flag are kind of similar so im guessing thats where the issue is coming from.  I cant seem to edit my location either.

        "Hey miniclip.. good morning.. i am from india.. i was playing 8 ball pool dubai match. I was just about to win when i hit my solid ball and then last black ball was left but the ball goes in opponents hand said that you didn't hit your ball.. what was that? Can you please stop all these hacks and all for other users. There is no fair gameplay between each other.. please do some favourable to all users.  Hope you will take quick action in this manner Thanks.. Apoorv",
        "The game is very good. But that spin wheel is not fair at all. I've been playing this game for 6 years now (I know there used to be 1 coin reward there) and I've never got anything more than 2500 coin reward. My point is if you are keeping other rewards on that wheel atleast give equal probabilities for each reward. If not, just remove those big rewards and replace them with small ones but atleast with same probability for each of them. Hope you will do something. (P.S. i know it's a lucrative strategy developers play so that players will stick to the game. But you know just trying.✌️)",

And I was about to uninstall it..     2_one of the question was you can play with other users offline. This is not correct!...     3_ need to add \"Edit and changing names\"     4_Game rated with 5 star.. Than you all 🎱"

        "Love it.  I kept seeing ads for it and thought it was just another crappy rip off game, but I figured I'd give it a shot, and I'm so glad I did. Game play is fun, there aren't ads every 30 seconds, the app runs smooth, and the artistry that went into designing this game and the characters in it is absolutely flawless. Can't complain at all. Great game, I do recommend to anyone who likes puzzle and strategy games.  10/10!",
        "Awesome game. Sadly motivated by profit grabbing providers. The cost to buy extra lives is astronomical. The only way to buy on a more viable basis was via the piggybank and guess what. They removed it. When I questioned this I got standard fob off bull. I questioned that and guess what no reply. A shame, it is a great addictive game. Just don't get tempted to get you wallet out..........",
        "Zainy!  I can understand the addictivity of it, however, just as I was getting into each level, surprise!, is was completed! This spoilt a bit of the fun for me.  The catchy music, oddly I never got tired of hearing... Great game!!!  This review is after my first experience of the game which I played upto level 20 before stopping.",
        "Sounds boring but I'm loving it! Sucks you right in. Starting to get a little complex (actually using some real brain power) but still very much doable and no charges as of yet and I'm up to level 10 atm. I am no gamer by any means but I'm really enjoying this.",
        "After my anti-matter laboratory had a slight malfunction and destroyed half the houses in my town I discovered that I had a lot of time on my hands. So I discovered Toon Blast. Been busy ever since! Thanks guys",
        "Awesome game! Thanks to the developers for not only making this fun, but doing it in a dignified way (i.e., no annoying ads). I love this game! It's fun, addictive, and challenging enough that it's still entertaining 500 levels in! Love it, can't say enough good things about it."

        "Ads after ever single try, even if you only play for 5 seconds before you die. If you're trying to complete a challenge, every couple tries it will reset to free play mode and you have to go intentionally kill yourself which sometimes takes way too long. Then if you don't tap the challenge button exactly right, you have to free play again. Then every time you get back into the challenge screen, you have to scroll all the way through every one you've completed. The game would be fun if it wasn't so infuriating.",
        "I paid the 2 odd dollars to remove the ads since i really enjoyed the game. If you are thinking about doing the same DON'T. Paying the money removes ZERO ads. It simply allows you to skip most of them after 5 to 10 seconds rather than watching the whole 20 to 30 second ad. They still pop up just as often and are just as annoying. Personally I would wait for another developer to make a good clone of the game, shouldn't take long it's a simple engine.",
        "What I couldn't even get taken to dinner before being forcibly bent over with ads? I mean with in 45 seconds; I downloaded, opened, played 2 games, and BAM! There it is. What, you couldn't even butter a brotha up? Hell I'd even been fine being lathered up with 10 minutes. Soo ok, I bite, i watch the ad. Attempt number 3 is going well l, bam I die. Tap to continue, well there's a 5 second cool down for revive I didn't notice at first. So I think to myself \"well that's probably what I watched the ad for.\" Wait the cool down, tap to continue. So I tapped, and BAM! ANOTHER AD. Hmm welp you wanted a rating and here it is. Give me about 5 minutes of gameplay before two back to back ads and I might consider having the game installed longer.",
        "DO NOT PAY TO GET RID OF ADS!! IT'S A SCAM...IVE PAID AND IT DID NOT WORK. EMAILED THEM TWICE NOW OVER A MONTH. NO RESPONSE AFTER THOSE ATTEMPTS. Great game but deliver to customers when they give you money VOODOO. And a simple email would be nice jeez",
        "If you're a sucker like me then you paid the $2 something to remove the ads. Doesn't work, obviously a scam. Helpful Hint: If you play with data and Wi-Fi off the ads actually disappear regardless of whether you paid to have them gone or not. Although this shouldn't have to be necessary it's the only way you're gonna enjoy this game as there is and ad Every. Single. Time. You. Die.",
        "Paid to have add removed, no add were removed! Reading though the comments it's seems like I'm not the only one who feels this way. Bit of a shame as I wanted to like this game but it makes it impossible to tolerate for more than a couple of goes as the add pop up every time still!!"

        "Awesome game! Only issue is on season 7. Race with save 8 seconds on perfect drift.... it says 3 laps but one lap doesn't count so you have to do 4 laps and you can never save 8 seconds. When crossing finish line game keeps playing and doesn't finish, time runs out and you've lost. Please fix",
        "The car will control itself... If you hold left it will turn left for a period but will start to try and straighten up... To test is on lvl 1 first corner accelerate and turn left (any set of controls tried all) it will start turning right seems to be when the prospective changes. Looks like it would be good if it went where you tell it to. Might be due to latest patch so will try again if it get fixed",
        "Awesome Game... no need to spend money to get best cards you can easily earn them... Can play offline too... There is a glitch though in season 7 - save 8 second stage... even after finishing it wont give 3 stars and fails me.",
        "Good game, really fun. On season 7 the 6th drift game you cant pass it. When you cross the finish line it says wrong way and doesnt let you finish the gane to get the last star. You end up doing 4 laps, even with 20 secnonds still on the clock. Please fix the issue so I can complete the season",
        "Kinda hate the drift feature, like the car just auto drifts in the direction u turn. This gets annoying too since u can't turn normally when needed and the car just starts drifting, making u hit more obstacles. Graphics are good, my phone can handle the very high settings so I haven't played on the lower settings.",
        "Love the game. However, after finishing the race, an ad pops up and after closing it, the screen is all black and it stays that way. It happened to me a number of times. The stage is complete but I didn't get any of the cash rewards or the cards. Please fix this or at least give me the rewards I didn't get. Will give it a 5 stars then."

        "Game sucks donkey *****. You play maybe 10 beginner holes and get chests that open in 12 seconds. THEN you play a normal hole and get a chest that doesn't open for 4hrs. You only get four chest slots so that means you can only win four holes then you have to wait 4hrs (or 8 or 12hrs depending on the chest you choose to open) before you can get anything for winning a hole. In two days, I haven't even played 18 holes. Guess you gotta have money if you wanna play. Thought I trusted the \"Editors Choice\" games, guess not.",

It's a game...it's supposed to be fun not rocket science!! It should relax you but when you're played a level 6 or 7 times and you get down to needing1move to win... yet again... you get stressed!! And the levels should be concentrated on tasks to fix the house not on things like starting a new day or talking to someone to fix something! PLEASE fix these things so it's fun! I like a challenge but this is ridiculous!!!",

The basic control problems u have w/ ne downloadable games.",

It is a fun game but why are there pressure limits sometimes I don't like it but this game is it for teens it's for everyone it's really fun and well sometimes I don't like it when it takes me a long time to get money for a shark",

I cannot play the game at all with it not freezing and making me start over.. I don't know if it's a virus or what but I wish it would get fixed."

You drop $70 for Premium only to find out the best features are still locked because now there is Premium Plus for ANOTHER $150. You are not told other than here by me that what you get when you buy Premium is a Premium-lite. You hear about Premium Plus for the first time after you have bought Premium (lite)",
        "I do liken the game. Here are my pros and cons. Great graphics, wide variety of levels, and ease of controls.  Weapons are too expensive, the game stays one step ahead of you as far as when it offers you deals on weapons. You will either not have the points or coins to purchase and then when you do it offers one level too high at your point in the game to purchase.",
        "Nice game. So far I've noticed only critical hits count. Taking out a knee or a shot to the gonads usually fails. Upgrades are like any other game, spend money to get the good stuff. Hopefully it doesn't get to the point I can't unlock the items to keep playing.",
        "Sinse last update when playing when get killed it will show score screen but spawning back to game locks up and won't play just have to watch myself lose or stop and start over losing my life??????? Please fix...... Would like to know when you are going to fix can't win for losing life and diamonds and not even getting to play!!!!!!!!!! Don't know what you have done to the game getting where it is no fun getting killed before you even get respawned"

        "I've love playing this game since I began. The main issue I have is that when you buy a new device to play on, none of your progress is saved and you have to starts back at the very beginning. I had more than 80% of the venues open, over 1.2M coins,  and nearly 100 gems. I bought a new phone and nothing was saved. That sucks! Can someone respond, find a way to save your progress so if you switch devices to play on,  you won't lose what you've gained and maybe return my earnings!",
        "The game is awesome, as for the loyal players like myself your game isn't fair with the diamonds on the casino spin 😢 I play everyday at least 8hr or more and only receive 15 gems every two days or so. Please try to rectify the situation I have never received double or triple diamonds on a spin and I've been playing for a year or so. Why?????",
        "UPDATE 4 the NEW BUILDINGS PLSSSsss? TY... Cant Wait. Hope its coming real real soon and REALLY hope theres MORE to come after. U HAVE A WINNER GAME HERE. i bought ALOT of games, & this one is on the top 5 list. Keep up the great work guys/gals. Awaiting the new buildings. lol.    :-)   TY",
        "This game is good and addicting it just sucks with the fact you need to use gems from everything. I wish it was more things to use just money for. I have all this money and run through gems quick and it takes too long to obtain so I end up not playing for a while. A good way of doing this is through earnings that you collect from your restaurant. You can receive 1 gem",
        "Game is very fun and addictive. But you shouldn't have to spend few hundred dollars to play through the game and play all of the restaurants. Yes you can earn gems for free but would take an insane amount of time with each restaurant requiring more and more for each upgrade as you go on.",
        "There's no way to contact customer service for this game. I just bought the new restaurant with the noodles and duck and my sauce cooker doesn't work. I swipe it and swipe it and nothing. I'm doing it the way the tutorial showed but mine doesn't work. I might get lucky and it will come on but I'm losing all of my customers. I think they need to change it so we just have to tap it. I hoping they'll see this so they can work out the glitches for this new restaurant."

        "Simple, Nice and Addictive. Almost perfect! But the game build lags from when the log records too many life events, which could be solve with a clean log record button. Another Thing is the name your child gets when your child is born in korea but you are from another country, the kid gets your name instead of your surname as his/her surname",
        "I love it! The only thing I would say is to let is have the option to transition without being diagnosed with gender dysphoria. Or at least give us an option on the action board(with the profile of our person) with the option to identify as a transgender at schooling age of 6 or 5. Also, can we have the option to go to early schooling from 2 years? Some people do this. I love this game! It's very interesting and fun.",
        "After so long Google will actually let me review this now! I absolutely guarantee you will have fun with this game. There's so many choices that affect your life, you can be so many different things, and no life is like the other. If you're looking for a quick life simulator game to pass the time, or just play any time at all, this is the game for you.(P.S if you want to transition, you need to be diagnosed with gender dysphoria. Very rare.)",
        "Overall Its time killing for me, and, just some advice, we should have a Save state, because im kinda upset like.. i have played these game for 3 hour to age of 60 and retire and having a 7/8 mansion bedroom but i accidentally clicked back and then its started over again.. I wanted to see ma kids grow lol, but then i clicked it :(",
        "I love this game and it leaves a lot to your imagination. I do have a few things I would really love to see in this game. I would love for there to be 5 bedroom houses. 4 bedroom houses just aren't big enough sometimes and mansions cost WAY to much even if you're making over 100k a year. Also if you can control your children as well as make suggestions to your spouse to get a job, work out, ect. Would be amazing.  I would love to be able to have little grand babies on the game as well as step children. Even though this last one is a small request I would love to have my children in order by age if I adopt an older child then the children I already have without them being at the bottom of the list. It already states that they are adopted in their details tab so they shouldn't have to be at the bottom.",
        "Great fun little life simulation with a lot of potential. Their need to be more career paths other than work, painting, music or ceo. I want to be an athlete, a career criminal, drug runner, politician etc. And the UI needs to be cleaned up. There's no reason why clubbing and holidays shouldn't be under leisure."

        "This is my favorite game on my phone. I only got it for something else on a different game, but it turned out that I loved it. It is a really fun game and the controls and stuff are easy. The only thing I don't like is that when you shoot sometimes in attacker defender, the other person jumps up and blocks the ball when it's already almost to the net. Please fix this. Overall though, it is a great game.",
        "U guys need to give me like 10 billion dollars. Every time I'm winning in the game it cuts off, it says \"connecting\" like seriously. Iv got the best WiFi in the world and it says connecting. Like really, iv just been loosing due to this. Fix it. Or give me 10 billion dollars in the game. I wont play it anymore if I get cut off 1 more time.",
        "The new update attempts to force you to buy gold bricks I'm order to unlock your gift bags. This may force me to delete the game as it's annoying when your winning multiple games . They could at least adjust the price of the gold bricks. Use to be one of my favorite games and I am not one to play to many games .",
        "Good game. Balanced controls. Thanks to the developers 😀. However the game shows constant network connectivity issues. Even though I use a very high speed wifi and data it still kicks me out for bad connection which leads to losing the game. Pls Fix this guy's. Apart from that an awesome game. Thumps up to the developers",
        "It's great but the new updates suck..Why now you have to wait for the bag you won!!! in a game? You have to wait almost 2 hourse to get one of the bags open? Also you mussout on the other bags you've one because the space is full and you cant het anymore bags until the load or you pay your golds!!! i see that your trying to make money and thats sad because i believe this game is a gold mine with in itself!! but dang the bags!! really? We have to wait for the bags we won!!! to ready itself for openings!! that's stupid!  i think yall should put it back to where the bags just open when you win a game!!and get rewarded a bag. That's really like hey you won a $1000 buck but oh wait you need to pay your taxes first before you can get whats left of it!! Sad!! Put it back to the way it was!!!",
        "I think it's a good game and it had an awesome foundation up until the latest update. I am completely and utterly dissatisfied with the newest update. What happened, Mini Clip =(  Now it just feels like I'm waiting to play instead of playing. I'm alright with change just not coping Clash of Clans terrible waiting system, for prizes I won..."

One of the reasons that I  love word games is because the screen is without animation. It would be great if this was an option that could be turned off in settings.",

        "Challenging, fun and interactive! Great app for those who likes brain and vocabulary challenges :D Down side is that after the update, the butterflies run out in daily challenge even before i finish the puzzle so I always end up with 2 stars... please fix this bug or error...",

        "Where did the free hints in exchange for ads go?  They had recently moved to their own button, found by hitting \"Shop\" then X-ing out.  Today, they are completely gone.  I'm going to stop playing this game without them.  It's no fun to get stuck.",
        "Ok. This is my THIRD review of this game and I'm getting a little upset. You put the clues back. Thank you very much for listening to us all. Now I have a new issue with the way you have changed this game. Before People Fun came along, when we put a word into the puzzle, sometimes we would see things like, \"Excellent!\" Or, \"Spectacular!\" pop out at us. I noticed this morning that you've taken away that feature. Why? This game was absolutely perfect when you came along. Why are you changing it? Who are you, that you would take a perfect game and then take away the best features? Those words popping out made the game more fun, and they encouraged us to keep going, and yeah, I don't mind saying it. They made us feel good about ourselves. It was a pat on the back. Who gets many of those these days? And you took that away from us. Now this game is dry and boring. Please put the pats on the back, back. Thank you."

        "I like the game its fun and engaging but the premium choices cost a lot of diamonds and you don't get a lot opportunity to earn them. 12- 18 diamonds for more then a couple  choices in a story to make interesting choices that wouldmake the storys better but you only earn 1 diamond a chapter witch you have to wait an hour or more to unlock or buy keys.  So you pretty much have to spend real money for this game to really enjoy it. Ill be deleting this app not worth my time.",
        "While the game is enjoyable and the stories are intriguing, it is way too expensive to make certain choices. There is absolutely no need for choices to cost 20 or 25 diamonds when you only get 1 diamond for each chapter completed.  This game is in no way good enough to warrant spending real money on it, especially considering the ridiculously high prices of making certain choices which would require making a purchase in every single chapter.",
        "The game is great. Great graphics, nice music, perfectly cued entrees  for new characters, amazing story line.... But they don't give you enough keys or diamonds. I mean, y s its understandable that the chapters are long but 2hrs for a recharge on keys? Really? Either make the waiting time shorter, give us more, or both. Now as for the diamonds, they give you 25 of them. But each special choices is always way to much. And you never really know when your going to need them for something serious. With that said either give us more keys, lower the cost of the choice, or give us more diamonds per chapter. Not like 2 but 5 or more.",
        "It's a brilliant app, though sometimes I wish there wasn't as many gem choices. I fully considered buying gems until I realised how quickly they'd be used.   My favourite story was It Lives In The Woods, though most of the choices are gem choices. The story itself is fantastic, and I love the diversity of characters.   I had a problem with a story playing up and after a chat with the team was told to restart it. I didn't mind but I didn't get any keys to compensate what I'd already spent (I don't buy them I just wait for then to recharge, but it did mean I had to respend keys on one story because of a issue out of my control)   Overall its a great app and highly playable without spending.",
        "Diamond choices come up way too often for how much they cost and how little you get. The keys have an unreasonably long cooldown to get them. Options like watching ads to get diamonds would be a great option, especially seeings how you have that option in HSS and HU:RS. All that aside its a good game. Lots of the stories are enjoyable and its visually pleasing.",
        "Great graphics and great stories. Right now they have like 30 \"books\", so there are lots of options. I've been playing since 2016 and the app just keeps getting better. Can get a little pricey for the preminum choices, but otherwise it's a fantastic app; very additive and entertaining"

Because when I click the restart button then click the screen I would always end up behind the starting point even though I didn't move yet I die immediately why is that? pls fix it, everyone who played this game of yours would appreciate that.☺️😉 (btw I kept on dying on the first part of the game because of that so....I deleted the game!😀).",

The game is too hectic and the gravity is too much compared to the last update. It's a really good idea but I hope this isn't just a quick grab for cash.",
        "Having to restart the app every time you want to play instead of being able to hit RESTART sucks.  The app won't let you restart a game without a glitched ball each time.  Also, the speed of the ball is ridiculously inconsistent.  Sometimes you get games that are at a reasonable speed and other times it seems like the ball speed has increased an unreasonable amount to play.  Why even bother trying to load the game each time anymore?",

        "Poor quality game that wasn't tested before release! After your first death you can't land on the platform upon restarting and immediately die, the only way to have another go is to completely close the app first."

No complaints... No p2w... and the graphics if you set them to full are just phenomenal!!! Keep it up guys!! But fix the loading issue so we can get back to akademia!!",

I had a character on some other server and it seemed to be erased when the new server opened? Its fine though, previous character did not have too much progression. Music is not the greatest though, would be good if you could include more classic FF music in the game.   Dailys seem a bit overwhelming. There are so many quests to complete each day to get all the chests.   Other than that im quite enjoying it. If you can't load the game after update clear data and dl again",

        "Lots of fun. Unfortunately, the other day I had to do a factory reset on my phone. When I installed Design Home afterwards, all of my designs, progress...all of the money I've spent on the game for over a year was/ is gone. It created a totally different designer number (profile) for me. It wasn't connected to my Facebook for privacy reasons, but now? I don't know if I can keep playing, if I have to start all the way over. If you want to play, you'd better link it to Facebook.",
        "This is an awesome game.  Especially since I love decorating.   Few things though,  how about pillows on the plain sofas, modern pictures for modern furniture,  traditional scones, etc, for traditional designs, and more diamonds or stop using extra sofas and expenses that take away our diamonds. We need more accessories for the tables like books, vases, and flowers, also how about some better pictures because your choices are by far not worth $1000.00.  Last but not least, more colors in furniture with two or three toned designs.  That's what designers look for.  Thank you! Still love the game.",
        "The game is addictive. I wish that we could see who we are up against in the voting to better understand the rating we receive. It would be great if we had the chance to buy limited accessories 1 more time. I love the new challenges that we have received in the last few weeks. I've noticed every time you make an update that I have lost some furniture why? I do not like that you have increased the dollar value of buying the highest amount of gems. I won't buy again. Losing intrerest real fast.   Thanks again.",
        "I super loved this game and I am glad tapjoy is back.  I just have an issue lately.  I completed an offer lately but never got rewarded.  It says it might take 24 hours for the submit button to appear so I can contact customer support but it's been 3 days now and it still says pending.  I have no other way to report it.  Please look into this. Voting is an issue but it's the players who are voting and they vote for whatever they think has a better design no matter if they follow the requirements, you can only use a furniture for a limited time and will have to purchase it again if you want it.  I understand those things but I hope the reward for every design completed is higher than 500 so we''ll have more to spend and make the furniture more affordable.  Otherwise, this app is one of the best!",
        "I love this game concept. I also like the \"borrow\" option but I don't have anyone to borrow from because everyone I know stops playing because it's too difficult to advance (achieve 5 stars, which is the quickest and nearly impossible way to do so. Impossible because your advancement is based on user preference). A \"sort by price\" filter would also be cool for those of us who enjoy this game but are on a limited budget.",
        "I wish rating took into account the design assignment. People design completely different styles than the description and as long as they design in black and white or a neutral palette it will win votes over a design that is actually following the instructions. Contemporary design beats Mediterranean or Eclectic every time. There's no point in even entering those contests because people who do a contemporary design will cancel your design out."

        "The game is a bit fun, but the ball physics can be frustrating when they hit the corners of a box and behave in unpredicatable ways. It's most frustrating when it clips a corner and abruptly shoots off to the bottom instead of correctly bouncing around.  I also suggest you not spend money on the \"No Ads\" feature. The developer update notes says there's been a fix to the no ads thing, but I'm still seeing ads everywhere. I can't even open the game without an ad being shoved in my face that I have to skip before even seeing the game. I paid for the no ads thing, and got even more ads than before.

        "Just downloaded this app.  So far a very well executed app with excellent layout and controls/easy and fluid to use.  Much better than other Sodoku b/c no ads during actual game play!  The only \"con\" is that I cant put graphics behind gameboard. Only suggestion: Would like to see options for backgrounds like in Solitaire. This would truely make it a 5 star game!   Ps. I was not paid/reimbursed or otherwise incentivised for this review in any way.",
        "I'm addicted to this game especially the daily challenge boards. Pros: pencil feature, all instances of the number Are highlighted when you fill in a cell. Con: the timer starts when board opens, would like it to start after filling in 1st cell. As others have said the ads are right below the numbers, too easy to tap when your on a roll.",
        "I like this app, but it feels like it could be more educational. I get stuck on the expert puzzles and often have to use the hints, the way the hints just tell you the number in a selected square doesn't help me work out what I'm missing. If the hint could show me how I could reveal another number would be more helpful to me. Otherwise top notch app",
        "It's a pretty decent sudoku implementation, far better than a lot of the other ones out there I should say. The only issues I have are firstly I do find the \"penciled\" numbers to be a little on the small side (on a 5.5\" screen). I'd also say that for those of us that don't find the \"expert\" setting particularly difficult (without meaning to sound arrogant), it would be good to have a step above that. And finally a Google Play leaderboard would be a nice addition. None of these are massive problems, it's a good app as I said.",
        "Great app. I can do Sudoku on the app with the 'write' facility for numerical notes and I like how it removes them automatically as you fill in other areas. But I still find it very difficult to do paper Sudokus because I can't fill in the right answers without loads of workings out on the more challenging puzzles. The app makes this aspect easy.",
        "I would greatly prefer to start by touching a number rather than touching a cell.  I have to hunt for a cell with the number I am working with, touch that to show where all instances of that number are, then touch each cell and the number to place either the number or a note that this might be the number.  If I could select the number first, I would only have to touch each cell to place that number, then turn on \"note mode\" and touch each cell for a note.  Only half the taps per game, saving both time and the muscles in my arthritic hands!"

        "Ok best game ever. I always dreamed of playing games like pubg or ml something like that but its just not my thing yknow? How its hard to control and super annoying to play. But this god this takes the trophy. Easy control, fun game play, get to live again after dying so no need to be sad so yeah well done gi",
        "Update: Game was fixed very fast and is my favorite game. Everyone should download and play this game. It's simply amazing with great graphics!!! Only thing is why can't we have a woman character? I'm a woman in real life and want to play one online too!!! When are you all going to add women characters???",
        "Graphics are good an Gun play is pretty fair. When battling the game goes on runs where I get matched against teams whos members are way stronger then my team an I. Then it goes back to fair match making.   3 Month UPDATE: The game has turned into a money grab. You have no chance to compete against players that drop a bunch of money an have 4 an 5 star guns. This was the top shooting game in my opinion, but turning it into a pay to compete killed the fun with this game. Havent been match fairly against players in a couple weeks now. I would recommend trying a different p vs p shooting game.",
        "Amazing game, however there is one small problem, but not enough for me to not give it 5 stars. Recently when I've been watching an ad to double the reward at the end of the battle, the video has played until the end and it says the reward has been doubled, but I only receive the regular reward? It has happened 15-20 times and it's getting slightly annoying, as I'm about 4000 gunbucks short of what I should be now. Anyways, thanks for making such an awesome free game with little to no adverts!  UPDATE: video watching for additional rewards does not work with anything. No extra crates or supplies",
        "One of the best fps I've played. Graphics is cartoonish but fun, Remedy is underpowered in the sense that it doesn't generate a decent HP on each hit. On lower levels, it's decent but on higher levels against Porcupine, Ranger, Thunder it doesn't stand a chance that could be balanced out by either increasing the rate of fire or increased health generation on each hit , Lifestealer is pretty darn awesome but could do better with a bit smaller crosshair and little bit more accuracy",
        "Initially the game seems super addictive but once you hit level 16 it gets ridiculous. You have players who have spent money on guns and you're practically no match. Also the teaming of players should be balanced out. Another thing is even if you win a match you win around 30 trophies, if you lose there's a loss of 60 and if by chance you're internet is bad and you automatically get kicked out and cannot reenter you lose a 100 .Eventually you get sick and tired of all this and the game gets boring."

        "Well this is a surprise. It does not have much story yet but a good read if you've every played pixel berry's \"choices\" game. Same concept which means choices are going to need diamonds. Meaning you need to pay to do them. I really find it a nice read but since the books are few i'm on hold on purchasing diamonds. I guess once a series is completed i'm willing to buy diamonds to replay that game. For now i'm just browsing the game and taking notes on how many diamonds are going to cost per book.",
        "This game is amazing! The graphic is pretty great, plus the story is super ADDICTIVE. I can't stop reading this story but because of I have no pass left. However the problem is the pass, the pass is too little and the time is pretty long to wait. I hope this app would give much pass and please make the time shorter. But still this game is awesome, I recommend this game for you. You should download this app and try it.",
        "Love story games but it requires me to pay so much. It would have been decent if i spend only $3 or less for a game but pay almost $10 to play it especially if you want the characters to grow into liking each other. Its way too expensive. Need to reassess and sell the passes n diamonds cheaper! Otherwise it would have been a nice game. Its too much money.. cos they only let you play first 1 to 3 or so episodes for free n the remaining ones need passes n diamond which cost money. At some situation some diamonds requested are way too much...",
        "Great game! Awesome and enjoyable storyline, alongside with great characters! My favorite series is for sure the Campus Hacker books! Definitely recommend this app. Ads come up every so often, and you don't get very many passes, but other than that it's awesome!"

How are we supposed to play these games when most of these slots by default are asking us to bet several hundred thousand credits at a time? And yes, I do buy coin packs on rare occasions, but I shouldn't have to just to play this game! 😒",

        "This is my favorite game on my phone. I only got it for something else on a different game, but it turned out that I loved it. It is a really fun game and the controls and stuff are easy. The only thing I don't like is that when you shoot sometimes in attacker defender, the other person jumps up and blocks the ball when it's already almost to the net. Please fix this. Overall though, it is a great game.",
        "U guys need to give me like 10 billion dollars. Every time I'm winning in the game it cuts off, it says \"connecting\" like seriously. Iv got the best WiFi in the world and it says connecting. Like really, iv just been loosing due to this. Fix it. Or give me 10 billion dollars in the game. I wont play it anymore if I get cut off 1 more time.",
        "The new update attempts to force you to buy gold bricks I'm order to unlock your gift bags. This may force me to delete the game as it's annoying when your winning multiple games . They could at least adjust the price of the gold bricks. Use to be one of my favorite games and I am not one to play to many games .",
        "Good game. Balanced controls. Thanks to the developers 😀. However the game shows constant network connectivity issues. Even though I use a very high speed wifi and data it still kicks me out for bad connection which leads to losing the game. Pls Fix this guy's. Apart from that an awesome game. Thumps up to the developers",
        "It's great but the new updates suck..Why now you have to wait for the bag you won!!! in a game? You have to wait almost 2 hourse to get one of the bags open? Also you mussout on the other bags you've one because the space is full and you cant het anymore bags until the load or you pay your golds!!! i see that your trying to make money and thats sad because i believe this game is a gold mine with in itself!! but dang the bags!! really? We have to wait for the bags we won!!! to ready itself for openings!! that's stupid!  i think yall should put it back to where the bags just open when you win a game!!and get rewarded a bag. That's really like hey you won a $1000 buck but oh wait you need to pay your taxes first before you can get whats left of it!! Sad!! Put it back to the way it was!!!",
        "I think it's a good game and it had an awesome foundation up until the latest update. I am completely and utterly dissatisfied with the newest update. What happened, Mini Clip =(  Now it just feels like I'm waiting to play instead of playing. I'm alright with change just not coping Clash of Clans terrible waiting system, for prizes I won..."

        "Love this game. My only issue is with an update a few days ago that gives the background animation. I  have visual issues and the movement is making this game less enjoyable for me. One of the reasons that I  love word games is because the screen is without animation. It would be great if this was an option that could be turned off in settings.",
        "So good I've finished it! Great game for stimulating the mind. Waiting for new levels but at least I can still do the daily puzzle. Only downside is that some of the words are extremely obsure but the dictionary should help with those. Please hurry and add new levels.... I'm addicted!",
        "Challenging, fun and interactive! Great app for those who likes brain and vocabulary challenges :D Down side is that after the update, the butterflies run out in daily challenge even before i finish the puzzle so I always end up with 2 stars... please fix this bug or error...",
        "Very good but log in or if u change phone u loose ur game & start again! 😂 very frustrating when so far in lol! Also why is lea not a word i thought it was a meadow in the english dictionary? Am i wrong?",
        "Where did the free hints in exchange for ads go?  They had recently moved to their own button, found by hitting \"Shop\" then X-ing out.  Today, they are completely gone.  I'm going to stop playing this game without them.  It's no fun to get stuck.",
        "Ok. This is my THIRD review of this game and I'm getting a little upset. You put the clues back. Thank you very much for listening to us all. Now I have a new issue with the way you have changed this game. Before People Fun came along, when we put a word into the puzzle, sometimes we would see things like, \"Excellent!\" Or, \"Spectacular!\" pop out at us. I noticed this morning that you've taken away that feature. Why? This game was absolutely perfect when you came along. Why are you changing it? Who are you, that you would take a perfect game and then take away the best features? Those words popping out made the game more fun, and they encouraged us to keep going, and yeah, I don't mind saying it. They made us feel good about ourselves. It was a pat on the back. Who gets many of those these days? And you took that away from us. Now this game is dry and boring. Please put the pats on the back, back. Thank you."

        "App is still super buggy. Tried the update and nothing got better. Have weird red rings that appear around mini game and event fruits at random and make the game glitch. Extra blades that just appear and sit in a corner of the screen.  Ads wont count down, and entire app needs to be restarted to get back to home page. Also have the app freeze just after I enter games and lose all the starfruit/gold apples it cost to play, but never even got to open that game. Super pissed and dissapointed.",
        "Don't get me wrong this is a really fun game. That said I it drives me crazy that my account keeps losing it's settings. I will level up, get my Sword and dojo of Choice then two weeks later for no  it is gone.  I have Stopped playing because I am tired of Starting over on a saved linked account ever couple of weeks.",
        "I'm a great fan of ur game but I don't know why I'm not getting any dojos or blades from daily challenge. I got 1 dojo and 3 blades from daily challenge after that I played 15 days continueosly but I got only 5000 star fruit but no blades or dojos. Please solve this problem I really want to give 5 stars for this awesome game. 😞😞😢😢😩😩",
        "It's a good game.but unfortunately I launched the app once and when I left I couldn't get back.it just crashes over and over again...also when I tried to login to Google play it was an error,even though my internet is fine.thats why I don't want to reinstall it,because I'll loose all my progress:(",
        "Of course I love the game, but I can't get my free star fruit because the videos aren't playing. I can't redeem my free golden apples because of the videos not playing. I've lost out on more than 300 star fruit and 100 golden apples. Please fix this.",
        "Would have given 5 stars but ads are so annoying and far to frequent. I'd accept ads maybe every 5 games but theres an ad after every game and it's a good 30 second ad everytime."

        "I thought this games was amazing. Spent a ton of money and it was fun. Then one night, after putting up a 24 hour shield, I was zeroed. Requested IGG look into it and requested reimbursement. Unfortunate that their glitches cause so many issues. They have so many glitches that they cannot find any abnormalities in my 24 hour shield dropping after 6 hours...  will not spend another dime on this game, and I do not believe anyone else should either",
        "The game is good but very expensive.  There is not much scope for a free to play players.  Paid players will keep burning you all the time unless you spend money to be able to survive.   However,  the most annoying thing is that the game has become too crowded. IGG needs to make new servers and there should be limit for the maximum number of players in any particular server.  It is really difficult to survive even for paid players with so many castles everywhere in the map.  You don't get enough tiles to farm and nowhere to hide.  I give a 5 star rating if IGG works toward this problem. Thanks.",
        "This is a war game and you expect any transactions to be equal but it is not. Chinese guilds pay less for ingame currency (gems) than others which skews the game to favor Chinese guilds. It's a fun game but I dislike their transaction motto.",
        "Play this game only if you can spend THOUSANDS of DOLLARS for in app purchase otherwise this game is not for you...and all your money will go to CHINA. This game does not require any skills, that is why players who are super rich and spending MILLION of $ for in app purchase like Bren Chong are owning everyone in this game.... 》it is a RACIST GAME- In this game in app items are super expensive for you if you are not a Chinese, coz IGG is a Chinese company; and Chinese players will bully you coz they get in app items on 1/10 cost compare to you, so you will be bullied by Chinese guys until you start eating their ass.",
        "Some times its boring because after. Reaching castle 17. There is nothing left special. No skirmish no nothing",
        "I Don't normally play war games or any pvp games, but this has so much more than just pvp and war, or those build it and wait games! There's basically games within your castle that you can play while you're waiting  to build stuff and so much more!"

        "Great fun game. Only reason I didn't give it a 5 is because you go through your money pretty quick buying boosts to win levels to then upgrade your garden. I like the game a lot. Also I think that at the end of your board if you have undetonated items they should detonate at the end of that level. I've lost too many levels because of not getting one item that was next to something that was undetonated.",
        "I Love Gardenscapes and It Is Fun Way to Be Creative.  A Recent Update has Made it Definitely Better.  The Support Team Has Been Exceptional With Quick Responses and Answers!  There is Room for Improvement in the Amount of Coins Obtained in Completing Tasks, as Well as Eliminating Repetitious Tasks Requiring More Moves.",
        "I love home scape but it can be quite spendy. Both games are fun.  Love graphics animation laughter now free gifts.  Gardens cape is even more fun doesn't get boring like home scape when pay to win is obvious.  Gardens scape takes 1 or 2 coins with easier quests.   Still favorite.  Home scapes got greedy please return again where its not pay to win.  At times we need a color no bonus and lose because home scape didn't offer the color.  Spending hundreds on home scape so thinking of my budget and returning to garden scape.  Gardens cape started it all. Please lower prices",
        "Either make the puzzles easier or give more Passes to actually be able to pass the level ....make it easier to get to other rooms, too many attention to details..also so many tokens should be able to buy a few stars... I've been on the same room level since I started playing and way past level 100. Starting to get bored at this point.",
        "Much has improved since my original review (see below). There are special events going on quite often to help with earning coins and powerups, and the levels don't seem to be as tedious. Keep it up, guys!   \"I love this game but the levels are often too hard to beat without power-up help, and it takes so long to earn coins. Most of my friends have quit playing\"",
        "The reward for finishing a puzzle is around 50 to 60 coins. It cost 900 coins for 5 extra turns, and 1200 for the next. It has taken me up to 3 weeks playing all my lives as much as possible to finish 1 puzzle. This game is designed to frustrate you into spending money so you can complete the puzzles. Which I wouldn't mind if it was rewarded more fairly. Play Monsterbusters, it is by far more fun, you earn better rewards, and you can buy new lives and power-ups with your coins at a much more fair rate."

        "Everything about this game is great, but this company/developer really differentiate themselves from the competition with their customer service and support. Any issues I've ever had with adcap or any kongregate apps were handled extremely quick with the most professions experience.   Try the game, it's addicting, challenging, and very fun. It is a freemium game but don't forget to support the devs but purchasing a gift pack or even just downloading a game you like for $1.  Thank you for the hard work guys/gals",
        "About a few years ago, I had this installed on a Droid phone. I never was able to open the app to play. Recently, I glanced through the apps I had & remembered this one. After thinking it over, I decided to get it. Now, I am happy the developers decided to upgrade the game. This is fun. I am contemplating letting the 💰 accumulate for one full day just to see how much I earn. Thank you developers for providing a fun little time waster. I recommend this if you are the type of person who 💘 s making fake money. Try it out & hopefully you enjoy it.",
        "Yes this is addictive, yes it's fun, and it's great because you can spend 12 seconds or 12 minutes on it and still get the same amount of enjoyment. BUT, and this is a very big but, this game is a HUGE drain on your battery. And no, I don't have an iPhone - I have a proper phone - a Sony XZ Pro. So it's not the weedy battery. No game I have ever played drains the battery away as fast as this game does, so it's clearly an issue that I wish they could fix.",
        "Was having fun until the game decided to take about 30 of these megabucks from me for no apparent reason. Took me a while to get them considering how far I am. Not sure if I want to play anymore knowing this could happen again. Other than that it's pretty good.",
        "Way way WAYYY too laggy. It's an easy casual game though. I wouldn't say it's \"fun\" but it does pass the time and make you want to achieve the little goals. Only goal, make more money in game. That's it and you achieve that by not even playing the game so there's no challenge whatsoever. Uninstalled after first day reaching about 500 Trillion and force closing 100 times.",
        "It clicks on adds with out me hitting it at all. Then when I get back to the app it forgets that I watched the add at all even tho I watched all the way through. It happens repeatedly. It only forgets half the time but it almost always clicks on the adds. Other than that it's a good time killer with easy ways to get through it quickly as long as you watch some adds."

        "A great app to download. Great format and graphics. Lots of fun and challenging. Rated everything 5 star other than gameplay. It's good but not great due to the water hazard or out of bounds shots.  Players can hit into the water yet still finish on par. Water hazard should automatically be 2 shots. If this gets changed it would be 5 star no doubt and best golf app.  Single mode would be fantastic to practise",
        "OK I really love this game but all if a sudden I can't play it anymore. I try to set up a match and it just hangs in the loading screen then boots me to the main menu. I have sent 2 emails to support within almost a week and more than 48 hours apart. I have not received any responses. Other than that it is a great game and for the time I was able to play I enjoyed it very much and hope to receive assistance in this matter soon so I can continue to play this wonderful game.",
        "I had to change my rating for this game because I seriously believe it is rigged for me to stop advancing. Everything was great until I made it to pro level and now I'm noticing that whenever I am tied with another player with gems, an extra gem magically appears in the hole making me lose that round. How is it possible that I made it to pro level winning a good percentage of games and now I have played at least 50 rounds on level 3 and can't win a single one?",
        "To many play just to attack your ball after you hit. Regardless if they don't play well they win. A bit eh. The way it's done barely allows you to win. I agree with many others reviews. Something fishy about the scoring system and who you are placed against. Won't keep long if it continues. Could be awesome if it wasn't unfair. O.o",
        "This game is ok at best. More about luck then skill. Fun and addictive, yes at times. Ive collected all the trophies from 3 of the maps and was on a roll. Then out of nowhere a 15 game lose streak. You will get to the point past anger. There are a lot of pretty good/lucky players from around the world.",
        "Overall, game quality is pretty solid. Few graphic glitches here and there but can be expected. It would be nice to rotate to see a better perspective and easier to hit.   One must improvement needed is that when you play a bot, it's way too noticable. You need to improve the bot intelligence! I understand why bots would be needed time to time.  Coins could be cheaper too.  EDIT: Game froze on a Pixel XL, cost me lots of coins! Not happy."

        "This game is really fun and addicting. However, the omission of \"not nice\" words including \"sex\", \"damn\" and many other legitimate words makes it hard to take its learning value seriously. The word \"sex\" is on driver's licenses, passports, and all forms of legal ID. Oh, and the word \"queer\" is not recognized. Why? If the game could at least recognize words accurately, I'd give it 5 stars in a heartbeat.",
        "I just received an update yesterday  (2/1/2018) and now where you can watch videos to get coins, the videos are not playing.  It just goes to a black screen or boots you out all together. Please fix it,  for this is a great game, thank you",
        "Somewhat 'addictive'. I do enjoy this game, BUT, like other \"make words\" games, even if you have a large vocabulary, some words are too obscure, like \"burin\", \"carer\", \"cine\", \"doyen\", \"olds\", \"prig\", \"weal\", and \"weir\" (I have a list of 52 such words from the game). Can be frustrating when you have found a word that falls between two other words, only to have it be an \"extra\" word instead of THE word in the list. Really irksome when I spend tons of time on one last word, only to find it was one of the words in my obscure words list AGAIN. Maybe those really obscure words should be \"extra\" words.  At least you can get $ credit for those extra words. The Daily Wheel spin is nice, but when you press STOP, a random speed up or slow down occurs, so the predictable-ness that the wheel would seem to offer is useless. Old treasure chests were better.",
        "Awesome game!  I can't put it down. There's just one problem. Last night I had almost 500 points, but had to go to sleep; so I quit. This morning I had to start from scratch.  I've played this game before from my old phone & could always start where I left off, but playing it from this new phone, where I had to download it anew, I can't do that. Every time it's the same thing. HELP!!!",
        "This app is amazing I honestly don't know why you get bad reviews the only reason why is not always the apps fault. I would be grateful if you guys would sponsor my YouTube channel called night virizen",
        "It's a cool game to occupy your time. I'm hoping it will get a little more difficult as I go on but it's ok for now"

        "This is by far the best chess \"trainer\" for me.  It's got a nice flow and the game isn't \"stupid\" like most other chess apps/games I've played.  I plat at least a few games every night and I feel like it give me a nice challenge and makes me really think about the moves I'm making.  Especially at the higher difficulty levels.  Overall a great chess app with no glitches and a good brain inside of it.  A must for a chess player with any real skill at the game.",
        "I really was worried it would be too easy or too tough. tho I am not a master, yet, I know my way around the board.  I realized it has been making me a spectacular player ..the computer does not just do the same dumb moves over and over its almost like its stalking me like prey around the board! ha great game!!!-!!",
        "I love this game and the best brain exerciser game ever in the history.  The cool 3d view makes the game as if I am playing on the real board, very good graphics. However, it doesn't show the list of killed chessman during game play the only drawback. I am expecting this upgradation and this will be the perfect Android chess.",
        "For the non experts, let me tell you that 5his game cheats. I sat with a real chessboard to analyse why wasn't I  able to crack master level.   And what i observed was it didn't allow you to make actual moves when you show high levels of intell8gence. Sometimes it makes moves which are faulty. I think there is some mistakes in coding, perhaps deliberately made.  So not a fair play but a foul play.",
        "So far it's o.k. I like the fact that it is simply a chess game with no fancy sound effects or graphics. I see no real reason to have the higher difficulty levels locked out until they are beaten but they are. I got it to practice with. It is useful for that. It's not bad...Just a simple down to earth chess game",
        "The game has been drawn because the other player has no legal move and is not in check. If they can ot move then I win because they cannot move to a legal position. The computer ends the games too early because they cannot be bothered to chase you around the board. You cannot unlock the higher difficulty games because it just says draw."

If you're trying to complete a challenge, every couple tries it will reset to free play mode and you have to go intentionally kill yourself which sometimes takes way too long. Then if you don't tap the challenge button exactly right, you have to free play again. Then every time you get back into the challenge screen, you have to scroll all the way through every one you've completed. The game would be fun if it wasn't so infuriating.",
        "I paid the 2 odd dollars to remove the ads since i really enjoyed the game. If you are thinking about doing the same DON'T. Paying the money removes ZERO ads. It simply allows you to skip most of them after 5 to 10 seconds rather than watching the whole 20 to 30 second ad. They still pop up just as often and are just as annoying. Personally I would wait for another developer to make a good clone of the game, shouldn't take long it's a simple engine.",
        "What I couldn't even get taken to dinner before being forcibly bent over with ads? I mean with in 45 seconds; I downloaded, opened, played 2 games, and BAM! There it is. What, you couldn't even butter a brotha up? Hell I'd even been fine being lathered up with 10 minutes. Soo ok, I bite, i watch the ad. Attempt number 3 is going well l, bam I die. Tap to continue, well there's a 5 second cool down for revive I didn't notice at first. So I think to myself \"well that's probably what I watched the ad for.\" Wait the cool down, tap to continue. So I tapped, and BAM! ANOTHER AD. Hmm welp you wanted a rating and here it is. Give me about 5 minutes of gameplay before two back to back ads and I might consider having the game installed longer.",
        "DO NOT PAY TO GET RID OF ADS!! IT'S A SCAM...IVE PAID AND IT DID NOT WORK. EMAILED THEM TWICE NOW OVER A MONTH. NO RESPONSE AFTER THOSE ATTEMPTS. Great game but deliver to customers when they give you money VOODOO. And a simple email would be nice jeez",
        "If you're a sucker like me then you paid the $2 something to remove the ads. Doesn't work, obviously a scam. Helpful Hint: If you play with data and Wi-Fi off the ads actually disappear regardless of whether you paid to have them gone or not. Although this shouldn't have to be necessary it's the only way you're gonna enjoy this game as there is and ad Every. Single. Time. You. Die.",
        "Paid to have add removed, no add were removed! Reading though the comments it's seems like I'm not the only one who feels this way. Bit of a shame as I wanted to like this game but it makes it impossible to tolerate for more than a couple of goes as the add pop up every time still!!"

I would appreciate it if there was more background options like allowing me to upload my own background and more emotion options in the mobile version of create a story. Please make that happen and keep up the good work!",
        "My only complaint would be the gem choices. Although the app allows you to earn gems by reading episode official stories, most choices cost 15-20 gems. You would have to read an entire story (sometimes more) to gain the ability to get ONE gem option, and most stories have multiple gem instances. Other than that, the game is addicting. I would enjoy it much more of the gem costs were more reasonable (5 gems), or if you could earn gems by reading user stories too.",
        "Goes to the home screen with the stories, then you try and play and it never loads. I was highly into the game, even started to pay for more passes because well it takes forever to get passes and the episodes are to short but I still liked it until now. This game is officially trash and I will no longer get on it until the game is fixed. I know its not my internet because I have the BEST internet. (Google Fiber).                                            Update : I am very happy with the changes that have been made over the past two years thanks."

Not sure why that happen. Also don't like how you have a truck and the grass and or sand will slow you down. Also wish there were more color options for your vehicles. Other than that its a fun and addicting game.",
        "Love the game but cmon guys, how many times are the race ranking going to get messed up. Finish first... But says you were second, second but now I finish third, third but wait... Fourth. Not cool at all. Once or twice is whatever, but its happened at least a dozen times. Please fix this!!  Just dropped my rating again because its getting worse! Idk if its people cheating or what but this is ruining the game! The race rankings are a complete lottery, doesn't matter what place you come in because its gonna change... For the worse. Had it with this.",
        "Well it's ok but you are always underpowered I literally but the next 2!! Cars and I couldn't even get in 2nd place it's ridiculous I mean come on and I wasn't even up against real people it was bots. And the ramps using nitro on them is a deathtrap and the driving is Soo weird.",

It's exactly how I remember it being on our old computer, and it is SO ADDICTIVE. The very day I got it I played for like 4 hours straight. Literally. Honestly I love the game. A little unhappy about the ads but honestly you get what you pay for, and this was free, so I can't complain too much.",
        "I have completed 3 rounds in the past on this game and wanted to play again not having to watch a video after every level is too time consuming. Years ago not as bad. after 5 levels deleted. EA took a good game and turned it into a ad seeking game. UGH AND UGH. Do not play unless you love ads. Other games you can watch ads at your leisure for prizes but not mandatory. Good luck but if new to game RUN..Lots to choose from.",
        "It remains a classic, yet some parts are just too screwed up. After paying to remove the ads, the ad hoes with the play button still show up. The vase breaker was my favourite in the past. Now it is broken. 65% of the time ir reads actap like a double tap making it utterly unplayable",
        "Irritating. At first it gives you an option of playing a video to receive additional help. Which works only for the first time. Next time onwards no way to cancel the video in case you don't want to install it. It is so frustrating. Either allows to cancel or tell the users what to do next. Worst way of promoting other apps.",
        "It was good but then this happened. I was playing just like any other day. My phone had died while I was playing, so I charged it and left it untouched for about an hour or two. When I signed in, all off my progress was erased! Please respond and tell me what happened.",
        "The game was great than EA got to it with there sticky fingers and put adds everywhere, it isn't the same game I enjoyed ages ago. It's just another add infested game now, even if you do pay for it l. The charm is gone"

        "Its a super fun game and I liked it. But for some reason every 5 seconds an internet browser would pop up saying I had a virus on my phone. Checked my phone but nothing. It never did this with any other app even before downloading this. Only ever happened when playing the game.",
        "I actually like the game, but I got all the guys in 3 days.... Now what? There are no upgrades or any other options to use the money on. Also the same thing is happening as others said, where the browser keeps popping up saying there is a virus. Pretty annoying",
        "Fun game, very entertaining. Ads pop up too often, it opens my browser saying i have a virus. I cant avoid it and it happens very often. Im only keeping the app bc i hope the next update fixes this issue. Other than the stupid pop up its a great game and i enjoy it. Please fix it so i dont have to uninstall.",
        "I wanted to enjoy this game. The advertisements randomly open chrome browser windows with a fake virus scan saying \"your device is infected.\" Its ironic in that the software that you're prompted to download is terrible adware that an actual scanner might flag.  It's quite persistent too, happening only after I installed this. 30 second video ads midgsme and adbars that just so happen to pop up and hover where you have to click in-game.",
        "I love the game as a whole, and I just barely redownloaded it and it saved my progress, but I can't even get through one whole throw without it opening up chrome with a fake survey or whatever. I'm not joking, it's really bad. That's why I can't give this a good rating. I understand the need for ads in a free game, but for whatever reason, mine is nothing but ads.",
        "I did not play this game for a long time. I download it and I only played it for maybe 2 hours. I tried to play, but when I  was in the middle of the game and it froze and sent me back to my home screen. The controls I like. This is not the greatest game I have seen, but It's ok😐😐😞😞"

But good game I would try it. One question for RobTop games, though, what is with the \"buy full version\" how is there a full version. Reply to me robtop. I need to know. Not sure about it but worth a try and see if you like it. # Amsam production review.",

Please fix this and I will rate 4 or if it is better,5.  it was 2015 when i said this. now it is 2018. NO CHANGE. all the ads were still there!!!!! so everytime i want to try again, AN AD WILL POP UP AND BRING ME TO THE PLAY STORE AGAIN.",
        "Addictive & Fun I think GD Lite is super awesome and addictive. I think it's fun because it's challenging and there's super fun things in GD except hacking because that's no fun. Anyways GD is addictive because everyone gets it they beat a level get super happy and boom there into the game. And I'm super happy because I beat every single level in GD Lite! I hope there could be even more levels!                                                        Challenging levels in GD I think Clutterfunk is the hardest even though I did beat it :D! But the most toghest is       Clubstep, Theary of Everything 2, and the one and only Deadlocked the three demons in GD! GD is awesome!!!!! :D :D :D &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 I love you GD!!!!!! 😎😂",
        "Well, I admit, I'm addicted to this. The levels are SO FUN, and also quite challenging. Sometimes,yes, I rage, but it wouldn't be fun if it was too easy.The animation is sophisticated, the music is AMAZING (my two favorite songs are Clutterfunk and Can't Let Go) and they give you a TON of levels for a free trial. I LOVE THIS GAME!!!! Thank you Robtop!!! 🙌😎😍",
        "The whole game is very amazing. Listening to the soundtracks can make you get motivated on playing the certain level until you pass it. The game can sometimes make you rage a little, and the colors can be little bit to neon and flashy for you. The whole point that I think about this game is that it tries to make it very challenging. The colors are beautiful in my opinion. The ads can me sometimes annoying, but you can turn on the airplane more so that they won't annoy you too much. Keep up the great work, RobTobGames!   Cøokie",
        "It's a real cool game, I do recommend playing this game because not is it only fun bit addictive as well. There are loads of levels so you never get Bored but warning ⚠ the levels do get harder as u go further on. But yeah I do recommend playing this game it's super fun, super addictive and i would rate it a 4 star."

        "I like it.   The fish are friendly and encouraging.  I use the game to help me keep calm and relax.  Please consider allowing us to select another of one of the earlier aquariums when we get to the point where we are waiting for new aquariums to be developed and have finished everything.  I'd like a place to put new fish and decorations, but none of the old fish want to be sold.  They are still my favorite friends.  The game uses a lot of memory, and I had to uninstall it from my tablet because it kept making it crash.  Works on my phone, but it's still a lot of memory.",
        "Love this game!! I love the challenge with completing levels. There's days I can't get enough of this game. I play every day. I love decorating my tanks. I love when I get infinite time, but It would be nice if we had control over when to use it or the time would stop and be saved for when we return. Sometimes 6 hours is impossible to sit there and just play. One thing that would be nice is if we didn't have to wait 30 mins for a life to renew and could have more friends to  receive more lives and got to use the diamonds we earned amd not be stored in a bank to buy. Other than that I cant complain😉 best game out there and I highly recommend it to all ages.",
        "It's a great game. I play it with my daughter on our freetime it's quite addictive. Its great that you get rewards if you have to watch the movies. The only thing i would change is the reloding of the lives. Half an hour for one life is too long. Every so often you get a few free hours, but you need to have free time to play.I love the fact that we can play using my phone sideways (landscape ) as I have a problem with my wrist. I highly recommend it!",
        "Fishdom is a fun game.  The puzzles are challenging. I would love to see a change to the gifts we can give our neighbors . Such as, the lightening, or fireworks, or an ornament for their aquarium. I would also like to see the diamonds we earn to be available, not stuck in a bank, to be paid for.  Limits could be put on it, of course, but the free one here and there only help once in any puzzle sequence.   Overall, though, its a nice game.",
        "I love this game I just wish it was more interactive with the fish in one's tank. Like when you pet them little hearts appear and one can earn happiness points with so many touches. I also wish that one could still earn something for previous tanks. I have no real reason to visit my first and second tank. I don't earn anything for more decorations and it doesn't get dirty and the fish don't get hungry. I feel bad for them, but I focus on my current tanks.",
        "Got a new tablet for Xmas.   Had game on sd card. Wouldn't transfer to new tablet.  Was on level 105.  Have to start all over again! TORTURE lol. Other games I would just stop but not this one.  I love It!  EDIT...STILL LOVE THIS GAME.  Highly reccommend it!  Some levels are SO difficult but still loving this game Oct 9/17.  DEC 2017.  Still adore this game.  Now my husband plays too.  Best game EVER!"

        "Great potential, but there needs to be a way to earn free gems for the abundance of chest I have... Also there needs to be time to clean up the map once The main objective is completed and definently more chalice for chances to complete levels, I only have a certain amount of time to play so I need to fit it into my time, not yours.... Ok game but not a great game for the players, micro-transaction heavy and very little chances to complete the levels.",
        "Really enjoy the game. Relaxing and addicting. However, i dont like the large amounts of lock chests taking up my camp space. I think the lock chests are too much of a push to get me to buy crystals. Chances of getting crystals seem slim and with the small amount of space available for other things, this is a down side for me. If i have to pay to open chests that i have been rewarded, why play? That might be  something that causes me to quit the game before too long.",
        "When I first downloaded this game it was fun...now, all the dragons only have a stamina of 1 and now you need trophies to play levels. These trophies take f-o-r-e-v-e-r to accumulate. These things have made the game drag on way too long. And accomplishing any thing may also cost actual money now. I have read other reviews about the money system of this game and I will not be throwing my money down this drain.",
        "Loved this game at the start. But since last update it has crashed on me several times. Today alone it has crashed on me 3 times. I lost all my camp progress each time and had to start again and of course each time is different because it is impossible to duplicate. Today I also lost my dragon gems and dragons I had created prior to crashes. There fore I lost my money spent. I also lost my daily chest which  contained 2 life trees and a super egg fragment.  I am very upset and dissatisfied now and regret spending money on this game that I loved prior to all the crashes.",
        "Please remove The Challenges. The timer runs out too early on all of the challenges, all the way up to challenge 20. I have all the standard levels finished. I have been waiting for you to make new standard levels. The timer is cheating people in your challenges. There is no way they can be completed. I am not buying 50 gems to add 2 minutes. That's a waste of my money.",
        "The game is great but customer service is non- existent. I bought the 30 day gem special that was supposed to come with an egg and fountain. Got the gems (so far)but not the extra items. Tried contacting customer support several times but following their M.O., they never respond."

I downloaded your great game TO PLAY it. Please try to solve this issue. I will definitely give you 5 stars if you fix this. Please listen to us and read our comments. Most of us are mentioning this 1 -ve point. Thank you",
        "Great game but seriously?  The feul tho.  It takes 30 minutes to charge and it's only 5 as the limit.  Cmon that's bad!  I love this game and it has great graphics and it's a great time killer but please make the fuel like to 10 or make it 10 minutes to recharge.  If so I'll rate 5 star$",
        "This game deserves to be the best game of the year. Its so simple and yet mesmerizing. It is also very fast so you won't get frustrated and could play this game for hours (or until the fuel runs out :-P). This game is quite exciting and the visuals are also nice. This game deserves more than 5 stars. The music blends in quite well and jobs make it more fun. Their are many sources from which you can get rewards which makes it easy and challenging to play. I love this game. Also you can buy more fuel slots in the shop for 100 diamonds. Its expensive but I don't need it beacuse I have to keep track of the time and only play until the fuel runs out.",
        "Really good idea let down massively by the developers. Progress is extremely slow due to fuel taking so long to recharge and having to use gems to buy new vehicles. So unless you want to spend all your money on a free game, it doesn't really feel like you're getting anywhere.",
        "Not too bad. I would have like to see the car while playing, and the graphics could be a touch better. I would honestly like an option between dragging your finger and using buttons on either side of the screen. That alone would have given this a 5-star rating from me",
        "It shouldn't be easier to level up rather than actually playing game. I wouldn't say that the gameplay is difficult to play, but the purposefully placed trucks that shoot you is a bit ridiculous. Other cars are in the way which ultimately eliminates you before you can attack the shooting trucks. There really is no challenge except trying to beat your previous score. I give this game an eh out eh."

Why have a cloud save or play the game or spend moo pney when it's erased. I still love the game but now frustrated I will think about uninstalling.",
        "The puzzles are interesting, the animations are generally enjoyable. It quickly becomes a grind, though, where you aren't enjoying the gameplay, you're just trying to get past the timewasters of the daily challenge, or fighting the arbitrary points of the arena. The clan battles and Mighty Eagle challenge are the best parts, but you can't play them all the time. You have to grind away in the Arena.",
        "I just purchased a new phone. And being I'm using the same e-mail address i would have thought it would have started me at the same level I had been on prior to the new phone. Kinda sucks because i had spent a near fortune and was at level 64 ! Unless they can fix this I will remove the game for good. I mean I had every hat except the ones that cost 25,000. Now I'm at zero!",
        "RESUBMITTED: Arena games were sucked up by those high-card players or maybe cheaters. My power cards are the same, just like my opponent, or higher than my opponent's cards. When I slinging those piggies or blocks, it gives me lower points like 4 hundred thousand. But if my opponent slinging them all, it gives higher points like 7.5 million. I lost my winning streaks so I had to play again but it gives me same points so I lost again, sadly. I thought your arena games are really much fun, but they're not.",
        "GAH! They've over complicated this game with unnecessary graphics and gifts and prizes etc. I couldn't even figure out how to get into the levels for a while haha. I'm sure if I had the patience to go through and understand it properly it would be fine, but I didn't want to. Old angry birds setup was better. Wish you didn't change it. Uninstalled after 1 day.",
        "Classic gameply bogged down by aggravating fremium distration. Havent run into any energy bars yet and already on second world. New birds add interesting gameplay elements but spells are an automatic win that add no semse of achievement besides skipping a hard level. If you want some classic angry birds but dont mind clicking through to get to it then give this a download."

I earn for attack/raid master and the counter doesn't update. Freezes in the middle of spins. Don't earn coins for watching videos sometimes. This is even after the most recent update"

This is the only quality that ruins the game. The app opening randomly to show ads. To the creators; that's not ok. ONLY have the ads appear IN GAME",

It gets really annoying so I unistalled it. I do not sugest you download. I had music playing at it got interupted by a add, mind you that my phone was in sleep mode, and it scared me half to death cause all I heard was a roaring sound come from my phone.",
        "They put ads on your phone without the game even being open. I would be watching youtube with this app not even on and I would get a full screen ad.  Gameplay wise, it's a decent idea. The puzzles are very easy but the struggle of trying to initially move the ball is a little annoying. The graphics seem unfinished at some points (such as the level select) and it just overall seems empty and bland.",

If u do I would love to download this app again although it did annoy how every time I finished a round I would get an add straight away and that ment I didn't finish very many",
        "It was good but the game glitches and its WAY too easy. I, a 13 year old, finished in 1 and a half days. I thought it would ve harder, but it isn't. Also, only like 40 levels? It makes it easier. Only good if you want a quick, easy game."

        "So, what makes this one of the best games made?  Let me start by saying the game play is fun.  Try to get the top medal each round. The game on its own is smooth and simple.  Graphic and physics are decent as well. But what makes this the best game?  Ads are not intrusive. You can simply back out of them without the \"wait 30 seconds to continue.\"  I've actually watched ads in this game since they aren't forced. I keep them up because I wanted to.  This does not mean they aren't there or have little countdown timers, but you can simply hit the back button to close it. Next, you don't deal with \"you didn't get a perfect score, want to try again? Buy more lives.\"  Exactly. NO IN APP PURCHASES. None!  Thank you!  Keep playing until your heart is content. Lose all you want and retry. They aren't looking for your money. Trust me, try it and you'll see. You also may find yourself more interested in the ads. I know it surprised me that I was. Every developer can learn from them!",
        "Actually it is much easy and had very less features. It is not like a competitive game. In 2hours I have nearly unlocked 31 levels.  Make it a tough one....graphics is good but lots & lots of ads, very annoying ! And add scores there rather than medals",
        "This is a very fun game, even though the screen freezes almost every time I go directly to the next level. I have to close it completely and then reopen it - Please fix this then I will rate it 5 stars.",
        "Fun playing. Passes some idle time. Habit forming. How much more do I need to say before get something free? Lol...",
        "Meh!!! It not what i expected I'd like to do the training but also the 1 on 1 competition. If any1 know of a pool app. Hit me up.",

        "Absolutely love all of the geometry dash games! Colors and graphics are awesome, game play is challenging but fun, and the music is perfect! Only thing I can complain about is that I wish all of the levels from these free versions were in the full version. I own the full version and would much prefer to be able to play these levels without ads and with all of the cool characters and colors I have unlocked. Other than that though, amazing work you guys, keep it up!",
        "Woah. WOAH. WWOOAAHH!!! Oh. Another Chllenging game but thhe only thing i like in it tha it has Dantdm's Old Intro at the press start! Wow. I am pro at Geometry Dash Games and another one oh yea and there is Sub Zero(MK) name there like i saw them quickly. And i would say for the creator: plz. Creator keep the good work! Ok!!! And make more Geometry Dash and can u make something more fun for more people to play with!!!",
        "Oh my god... This is the best geometry dash free game I have ever played,  and is almost more fun than the full version.  Robtop, you have regained full respect after what happened with meltdown. I'm just speechless, at the amount of work that was put into these three levels, going from the camera angles to the animations. This game is not like meltdown,  which is three short amateur levels, but with three long, harder levels. This game is like a preview to 2.2, and I know it's going to be good.  We'll done, Robtop! Keep up the great work!",
        "This just blows my mind... one thing I would like to see in the future is some rob-top made tutorials on how each editing items works in the game so other players can feel more comfortable making their own levels and not be intimidated by all the other fan made levels... I am one of those players who is intimidated by the other fan made levels... This could help young and creative minds to create their own levels their friends can enjoy. Thanks 10/10",
        "I love this game so much.  Some of the effects and colours added into the game make it so fun to play and watch. Its challenging and thats what makes it fun. Its not like one of those games that are so easy you finish it in an hour. This game takes time and effort. Also the backround music is pretty cool. Especially nock em with headphones. controls are very easy to use, just tap to jump and usually hold to use the vehicles, so easy! This game is perfect and absolutely fun. I would highly recommend downloading geometry dash subzero.",
        "I've been playing this game since the last lvl was ToE. First time when i was surprised was an update with three or four new maps, also demon levels, but that was actually nothing, i felt at this moment ''Wow, update, ok''. I got more admired by new update with this walking thing, still dunno the name, but things they have added, i still love it. Animated trails, new wallpapers that was awesome. New updates have arrived in mini-games for free, also awesome, but now i guess they have no idea what to add, because what they've done this is the biggest and greatest update. I love this game so much, so i can't just put 4 or less. Gg RobTop, Gg."

        "Wow! Just WOW! I had been very skeptical about downloading this huge gigabyte and pay-to-win game, BUT after finally \"trying it out to see\" I am now hooked and now a believer of all of the hype! I have gotten pretty far so far and have a pretty decent crew and I have not had to pay a red cent at all. The grinding in this game is actually fun and I do not mind watching an ad or two for fuel. Simple concept, EXCELLENT execution!",
        "Wow, I'm extremely impressed. The gameplay is very fluid (as it runs on a 60fps on my s9+) lagging and unrealism is unheard of. Also, the soundtrack throughout the games retains just as much excitement as you'll feel beginning the game, viewing car selecting and racing. A must have game for car/racing/gaming enthusiast's. Very additcting.",
        "Ok, my game is back but I'm missing a lamborghini 700-4 that was decked out completely with fusion parts maxed out and stage 6 nitrous and tires. So, you owe me a what, 4 start or 5 star car decked as my car was you took from me. I bought crates with money real money for that car. So I want the closest thing to my car the same as it was. Thank u",
        "I used to love this game. But now all it has become is an ATM for the developer. Every good car in the game must be bought. Winning special events costs money. In game rewards have become useless. There are plenty of other racing games out there that won't require you to refinance your house to play. If I could give it zero stars I would.",
        "Sound could use tweaking, I've driven some of the t1 and t2 cars and they do not sound like that. The grind is real in this game but the developer adds events on a frequent basis to over shadow this. Which would be great if the events didn't expect you to either have the devils luck with silver key crates or a never ending supply of cash.   Over all, great game. I still enjoy playing it even when I hit a \"pay wall\" and that says something about the game. I've only put $5 into this game (bought a $4.99 special pack) and I've still made it pretty far.",
        "This is by far the greatest racing game I've played on a mobile device! The graphics are amazing, the controls are solid, and it keeps me coming back for more. The only issue I've found with it so far is the live races. Its sometimes hard to find a race and the races themselves seem unfair at times. Other than that, its a great game! Highly recommended!"

        "Just started.. but I must say the experience is fun and bonuses are good. I dont spend money until I have played a few days and played several slots.. so right now all I can say is I am not sure... graphics are good smooth play.. with good pays and many ways to get coins to play.. kudos! Will update this review when Ive played a little longer... made wins at first, but quickly gone... not a fan of tournaments should tell us which have tournaments so we can avoid them! Ty",

        "Awesome Game!! Really I like this game. I dont even have words to describe it. Totally Fantastic... Whatever you say, this is totally cool. But I have a request...please add a column of legendary bikes. Like there is Common, Rares, Epics, and Specials , there should be a column of legendary. Waiting eagerly for the next update. Thanks a lot of making this fabulous game. And I would also like to appreciate the colours and graphics of this game. Thanks to the team for making this game. I advice this game to those who are looking for cool new games. Please install it and have FUN!!!! Dont just look at the pics, install and you'll be amazed.",
        "Unless you have 16 hrs a day to put into this game to learn the track you will never have a very high score. Sometimes your vehicle doesnt respond the same as other runs also you may land on your tail and survive and the next time you die its up and down with the control if you keep going or die. And sometimes it tries to flip when you try to take off resulting in a quick death",
        "Great looking game, and good idea. I give it 4 stars because the tracks are not consistent. One time an obstical will work and the next run you hit an invisible bump and die. Also, a lot of the time it won't register your flips. These aren't huge bugs but considering the gameplay is based entirely upon these two premises, it makes the experience frustrating.",
        "Would and will give 5 star. But would like to see a gem counter. It gets rather tough keeping count.  Also I noticed sometimes that when come across the areas that have the 4-5 flat spiked walls that you have to time just right. When I die and revive they all seem to sync up together making it impossible to go under. I'll try and screenshot it next time. All in all great job and awesome game. Maybe a custom map feature for future. Possibly added to the no ads fee. Would be worth it then.",
        "Way much room to improve                                 So first you could get more bikes in there and add more levels and make the resolution better like 1080 or something add more achievements and more of those levels that you get when you are just playing that game outside of the levels. But other wise great stuff great stuff keep it up. Also some missions are impossible, unless as someone else's comment said you play 16 hours a day",
        "This game is my favorite game ever. The graphics are amazing, the controls are great. I can't seem to find anything wrong with this game. Me and my brother love playing it. I also like that it is available on Google Play Store and the Appstore on iPhones. My old phone was an iPhone, and when I got my new phone I was worried that I wouldn't be able to play it, but thanks to Ketchapp and Google Play Store, I can still play it!! Also, I would like to suggest that you add a feature that allows you to create your own level, but it's not something you have to add, it's just something I think would make the game absolutely perfect for me. Then again, you may already have that feature and I haven't seen it/gotten to it yet. Anyway, it's an amazing game, and I hope Ketchapp keeps making amazing games like this!!! (BTW, Ketchapp games are my absolute FAV.) Thank you!! 🚘😊🚘"

Wasted 3 years of time and data on this worthless app.... recommend not installing or uninstalling it... customer service sucks",
        "Ive played this game a long time. New update and instead of making the game better you screw your customers. I lost all my boosters and you expect me to continue? If nothing else its a matter of principle. You punish me by taking everything ive bought and earned, ill punish you by never giving you another dime and i will let everyone i know who plays or asks about any of your games ro stay away.",
        "EDIT: Update on 3/22/18 fixed NOTHING! New levels still locked as well! Worst update in candy crush history. Riddled with bugs. It didn't add new levels like it should have. Unlimited boosters don't appear on level when they should. And boosters are no longer allowed on lower levels. I'm at level 2100 something. I should be able to use boosters when ever I want! And I should be able to have unlimited boosters appear on all levels, not just when they feel like it. Fix and I will give more stars.",
        "Would love to give a better rating, but after the most recent update the game has very bad lag, worse than the usual lag it's always had. Updating this. Was hoping update today would fix the lag. It didn't. Also, adding 2 extra steps in order to replay a stage sucks. You know the old saying; if it ain't broke, don't fix it.",
        "I am getting 2 hours unlimited gift daily but i cant use it because after 5 minutes its goes up i dont get it for actual time which it shows pls fix it",
        "Just got new phone a few days ago already I had uninstall the game twice wouldn't get off load screen and then I have to turn on data just to get it started. Then after all that all my progress from 2 Day's is gone and puts me back on level 7 and I was on 15 or 20.... Still no fix as my last review on 3-17. Can't just play without using my data every time I push play can't cause the log on with Facebook is flickering and the only way to play is to turn on data and play"

        "Had friends refer me to the  games. At 1st I wasn't  happy I couldn't  just  select  the games I wanted to play I had to earn the level it was on to open them. It's  actually  been kinda fun trying to advance  to get to the games  I want to play  . Been a HOF \"groupie\"  for  3 years now and enjoy the bright colors,  games & especially  how fast technical support will respond  when the. System  jams up. . Thank you.",
        "I like the games but.. I would rather go to a real casino if i wanna spend and win REAL money, so buying coins with REAL money just for innocent playtime is a Big turn off for me. You lose coins fast like the real slots, unfortunately. I just start playing the game for the first time and I'm already out of coins. I believe they start you off with a low amount because I'm already out of coins in 30mins of play. The games and the graphics are fun though, which makes it attractive to play. My only complaint is paying for those coins..",
        "The variety of games are great, and I would enjoy playing them if I didn't lose all my money within 30sec... It's totally ridiculous to only get $800 every couple of hrs when the cost to spin one time is $250! Also, the big spin wheel sucks too... Instead of the normal $800, I get close to $2000. Big woop. Give more $ or make the spins less!",
        "Short reviews are tough as any gambling game if ya win it's fun & great. If you lose it sucks! Cash purchases of chips & extras disappear super fast! The 3 hr wait to collect a few coins is very long. Then the SPIN has not given me a BIG pay out ever & I've been at x 2.0 forever. I hope you listen to your patrons & investigate & consider meeting our concerns at least some of the way. We know you make TONS money also! Consider smaller costs on packages if your not going to ever let us win! Tyvm",
        "Have so much fun playing this. It's nice to be able to have a \"flutter\" and not use real money. Good fun, great graphics and so many different slots to choose from, plus the rewards are well worth it. Thank you hof! Awesome!! Love this game! Though only one thing to gripe about, the adds are becoming more invasive. Despite this I thoroughly enjoy myself! So keep it up!",
        "Hardly play anymore. The higher the level the bigger the minimum bet becomes and there goes your coins. Bonuses the are low.The only good payouts happen after you purchase coins. I haven't gotten rid of it because it is something to do while waiting for other games to be ready.  Update.... It has gotten somewhat better, however the payouts are still low even with a larger bet"

        "I enjoy this lifetime favorite with people worldwide, and Uno Dare is my most favorite mode. I understand it will be discontinued in June and I wish it wasn't so.    ...Hey Uno & Friends, could you please not ask me to rate an app I've already rated??? I was asked to read it again and then I came back to find I had made that specific request not to ask me to re-rate something. Your app needs to be reprogrammed so it knows if someone has rated it or not. (sigh)",
        "Tokens take too long to refill. Level up gives a few coins, why not a token refill? Tournament champion gets 4 tokens. 7 tokens for a day? Cheapskates! When do you want us to play, every 5 days? So cheap in giving prizes, guessing you want us to buy eh? I'll give myself a few weeks playing this game and am out. No daily prize wheel, just a daily \"less than 20 coins\" reward. Sooooooo cheap!",
        "It's just ok.  Hard to see your entire hand at times and some of the rules are different than the actual UNO game itself. When I contacted this apps tech support, they sounded as if they could care less and said they will not be making any changes to the game.  So I play until they want me to buy credits then I stop.  When they give me more free credits I play again.  I like the game UNO, just not this one so much.  Why do I still play?  Hmmm, that's a good question.",
        "Greatest game ever~~¤mean it.  The Updated game even better.  Need to be easier to play with Friends that you JUST made ~~maybe REPLAY!!!  😬 😲 😠 😐 😭  Friends where are you? Great for tablets.   I am UNO happy . Happy New years  .Oh don't terminate the game unless you just have to, I well try finding something other to do. Nothing Good ever lasts anyway.   Thanks for reading.  UNO POWER.",
        "LOVE! Please DO NOT end the game! This app is perfect all the way around. Best card game app ever. SOOO many people are gonna be upset if you take it down, so leave it up! These uno players are ready to rock this app! You will never not have people playing. It would be kind of cool if you could create your own avatar though.. & pick outfits and such. Not necessary, but a fun little quirk (:",
        "Classic UNO with a couple of modern twists and turns. I have never spent any real money in a game and I don't ever plan to, but here you also don't really need to. I've won many tournaments and got really far in the game without buying anything. You get extra coins by winning and completing daily tasks, as well as watching ads. But you're not forced to watch them. It's not just about luck. You have to play smart to win, just like any other card game. I love it."

        "Such a Blast to Play. App never seems to grow boring like some other games. Also the apps not constantly hounding you to spend on Upgrades and Advances which is nice. Your character jumps higher, flips and twirls faster as U advance further. I play it once or twice a day at least. All in All a great/fun app....ENJOY !!",
        "The game is very fun and progression is steady as you get better, on the downside once you get through your first play through with the app and come back later there are 30 second adds that pop up after every other round or so. A little disappointing but no biggie the game is really quite fun.",
        "I feel like I would really like this game but it is not working on the Android phone. So I have never actually played the game but I have tried to open it up like 50 times.  Every time I tried to open it, it would just lag out right when it was going to show me the home screen.  If this gets fixed then I will play this game and most likely enjoy the game but for now it is awful.",
        "In this game once you have all of the flips it gets really boring. Also there are way to many ad breaks. This game was really fun but now that it's newer it's boring. It lags to much and kicks me out. I give this 1 star",
        "Ads ads and more ads. And really pushy ads that you can't just close straight away too. You spend more time watching ads than playing the game, and honestly you can't advance in the game without watching ads for coins anyway, so it's basically an advertisement with a mini game in between. Scummy sell out app.",
        "This game is great but I would only rate it a five if there were less adds. Every game I play, as soon as I finished it said \"add break\". This is very annoying as the adds are up to 30 seconds long. Please get rid of them."

        "I absolutely love this game. The music is good, the challenges are really fun and... well, challenging. It has taken me several days of being asked by the game if I would like to review it because I was having so much fun and didn't want to stop playing long enough to review. But here you have it. This game is well deserving of a great review. I'm going to go back to the game now so I can keep on rushing.",
        "Awesome game I had ever played in my life... although I'm 20 just..😉😉 I just loved the game.today 21/02/2018 I installed it on my phone.within 1 hr I played 100+ times. Till now my highest score is 74 & I'm in challenge 25. Really loved this game very much. I recommend this game to my each & every friend...(even my enemy also...😂😂 Just kidding) I wished that I will cross 1000+ score on future.  Loved this game. Lots of Love to this game & ketchapp. 😘😘😘❤️❤️❤️",
        "A simple, addictive yet hard and raging game. I love how you can customize your spheres and roads--and to turn off the ads just turn off your WiFi or data. Honestly, after 250 it gets a little impossible to play lol. Keep up the good work, Ketchapp!",
        "Enjoyed, On a overall basis i really enjoyed the game. And i also finished all the 100 challenges within a time of 5 days, as the game is really captivating i kept on continuously playing it. But now i am kind of bored from it as there's nothing to do after i have completed the 100 challenges. If there is an addition of another 100 more challenges that would make the game more fun to play and i would enjoy it thoroughly. Also i am not sure how will i earn the other spehers and roads without any challenges, so if anyone can help me how in figuring that out it would be really nice. At the end the game is really good. Cheers to the creaters.",
        "Minus another star because it's now glitchy and no longer gives daily bonus. I'm on challenge 89 and the point accumulation is taking forever. Minus one star because the ad at the bottom gets in the way while playing. I'll be on a good run and barely graze the ad space and it stops the game and ends the run. Very frustrating.",
        "I'm obsessed with this game. It's not just playing to beat your best score. There are challenges that you can beat as you play and it makes it okay to have a bad run sometimes because you can still beat the challenge lol. Not frustrating, just so much fun. Not sure if my review makes sense, just play this game ok."

It's so awesome and I absolutely love how everything is pixelated and that makes it more charming. Not to mention that the music is fantastic as well and I never get tired of listening to it!",
        "Love this game because you don't have to spend real money, just tap the screen to get coins and also diamonds then upgrade the guns, rinse and repeat but it never gets boring. Only trouble I've had is a sore tapping finger. LOL",
        "this game is basically an app for watching ads. you are forced to watch ads in order to progress. on the top of that, when you upgrade your stuff, the game randomly starts an ad. to have double money, you have to watch an ad. to collect diamonds.. guess what, watch an ad. to start idle mode? yes, watch an ad. utterly disgusting, terrible design.",
        "This would be a fine time-waster if they reign in the ads, until that happens, about like the plague.  They started out as a means to (optional) easy buffs. Fine, annoying, but not that bad. Suddenly, random ads are popping up in the middle of the game and you get nothing out of it. Totally unacceptable way to run a game. Don't bother, there are thousands of other time wasting idle/incremental games that show an ounce of respect for their customers. These guys simply don't.",
        "A great fully free game. It is a bit ad heavy but absolutely no microtransactions so I'm fine with supporting them that way. Very fun game definitely worth a play",
        "Holy ads! Intrusive ads every few clicks. EVERYTHING is ad-based. Good gameplay, but obviously an app created to generate ad revenue."

        "The game is good (played like 5 missions so far) but i feel like there should be a jump and crouch feature, even if its just a jump feature. Maybe make some levels where you gotta utilize the jumping, maybe throw in some jet packs during some missions/raids to get to a certain area to either continue the mission and/or find some hidden crates. Also, maybe add some melee weapons too?  Besides that, the game is fun, the graphics are beautiful, the gameplay could improve tho.",
        "Literally the best mobile game I have ever played. All IAP so far is cosmetic, which is great. Very similar to destiny with it's own flavor. I do wish you we're able to jump though and shotguns in pvp are OP. Game is optimized well for my mid-grade device. However, it won't run on my gf's ZTE Grand X Max which is very unfortunate considering it's basically the same phone as mine. Hopefully this changes soon because we really looked forward to playing together. Download this game!!!",
        "Giving the review after 24hrs of gameplay. Have to say that it's awesome. Cudos to the creators. Loving the gaming experience. Graphics rendering should be calibrated more. Make sure to do that in next update. Coins and slots are hard to obtain. Many of them don't want  to spend real money so better give some daily tasks to complete and earn coins.",
        "Its actually pretty good for a starting mobile game. Its a little buggy, but thats because its new. If y'all want a mobile Destiny, this is where its at. Shooting is relatively comfortable (can't figure out how to jump), and movement isnt too bad either. Not bad at all dev team, good work! I expect good things to come of this if you don't try to go the dumb pay2win route.",
        "Good game but I expected it to be the best.  No loading issues or bugs encountered so far. Game loading takes about 6 seconds so no big deal. If madfinger sees this please add new maps and skins and weapons in SGDZ and enhance the game experience at FB as playing the game at gameroom sucks. I promise I will bring you about 100 new players if you did that.",
        "The graphic is awesome.But the game sometimes crashes when entering the casino full of people. Also, add chat system in co-op modes. It's hard to make people understand the puzzles without a chat. Add jump,crouch. It will make the game more attractive and the things are also needed for a game like this. I love the game. Keep adding new things, just don't turn the game into mostly pay to play game.Thanks."

        "I up my rating to 4. After playing 5 years, this game is really fun to play. I cannot give 5 star as i still having issues with the gem price too crazy expensive. Hope igg can revise gem price back, so many player can support this game, not the rich guy only. I believe you guys has realise many p2p player already quit, so better to revise the germ price again. Overall, i love this game^^",
        "Decided to edit my review to clear things up for people that says this is a money making scheme etc. To the people that say that, do u understand that this game is Free? The devs spend a ton of money making a game enjoyable for people, adding new content such as, new heroes, new events, new upgrading features etc. It's only normal to lock some heroes behind a paid service, and the heroes behind the pay wall isn't even game changing or op. U don't have to spend a cent on this game to make progress. Rolling heroes takes time but it's so rewarding when u get that one hero u were looking for. This is a great game and if u complain about ingame purchases for a game so well maintained then rather go play another free game full of bugs and zero updates.",
        "I really love this game, i've been playing it for nerely 5 years now and although it can be hard to progress without paying money it is possible. I am free to play which can make it hard but for the people that are not willing to pay money igg is there for you, every week i can earn up to 1500 gems which is probably the reason i have yet to quit. Other than that the leveling and many heros makea the game that much better.",
        "Holy cow, sitting at 100k might but leveling goes so slow now. Please do something, and new quary is really annoying and sitting in the way.  Edit: everytime I open the game through notification is doesn't load the game.",
        "I hate it. It's always connected to those fake link downloads ugh and if i donwload this game and run it for 30 seconds, the link will open BUT NO it's a lie. This game just wants to be seen as a game with millions of downloads and I HATE IT.",

        "I absolutely love this game and have loved it since it came out. I was never too much into Pokemon but this game has made me love everything about it. It's great meeting new people when doing raids and the new gym system is much better. My only improvement would be maybe to make it a little easier to do raids in rural areas. Perhaps lowering the CP, or giving a person more time to complete it alone compared to in a big group. Can't please everyone though! Keep going Niantic, we love you!",
        "I impatiently waited for this game for nearly 2 years. I play it with my 2 best friends and it's changed our lives for the better. We get out more and get much more exercise these days. I love collecting Pokémon and I intend to play Pokémon Go forever. Niantic hasn't yet delivered on all their promises, but they're working diligently and I'm very happy with the game so far.",
        "The battle is rudimentary like always, but that's not what I'm writing this for. Add the pal pad to the trainer menu please. It was an item that the games had to keep a list of your friends. I think that would be a great addition. Have your friends from around the world registered via usernames something to keep an eye on their level up and medals and even pokedex progress. It would be a nice addition I feel the game misses as an often times multiplayer game. I.e. raids and community events",
        "Pokemon Go is a pioneer into the world of AR. This game was a hit despite its incomplete composition, and this is why many people left. However, the game now is more complete with features such as raiding with others and dynamic weather. If you are looking for something new on the move, give it a try! Or if you left after launch, give the game another try and see how the game has updated over time. This game is recommended for suburban/urban players, as in-game features such as pokestops are not abundant. This game is still very buggy so patience is required. Thanks for reading!",
        "I enjoy the game play and weather mechanics and new gyms quite a bit raids are also awesome great idea. I think what would bring alot of original players back is trading pokemon. Then later down the road pvp battles. I hope you take my reveiw into consideration Niantic Inc. From one person who grew up with pokemon these would be great features for the game.",
        "It runs quite smooth and gives me an extra reason to get out and exercise. My only beaf now is that it is impossible to acquire any of the legendaries. If you live in a small rural town you will never have the numbers to take on anything beyond 3 star in raids. Everything else is awesome though."

It's most frustrating when it clips a corner and abruptly shoots off to the bottom instead of correctly bouncing around.  I also suggest you not spend money on the \"No Ads\" feature. The developer update notes says there's been a fix to the no ads thing, but I'm still seeing ads everywhere.

        "Suggestion:  Have your developer(s) move the \"In Game\" volume icon to the bottom left corner.  If youre appealing to the masses. Remember that roughly 90% of the world is right handed.  While holding a phone with two hands; sideways. I cannot be the only one that accidentally keeps hitting the volume button with their \"Thenar Eminence.\"  The part of your palm below your thumb.  That and I paid for your game. Stop making me watch adds for an extra life. Haha 🤙",
        "This will probably sound cliche but- Too many ads! I wouldnt be complaining if the 'No ads' payment had worked. Yes, it went through, And sure enough the money was taken off of my card, But the ads stayed. Otherwise, I like the game lots.",
        "Purchased the game with no ads for 2.99 since the ads seemed to make the game run slower. I recently switched devices and the iap button doesn't do anything. I have to watch the ads, deal with the lag and loss my 100% acct. contacted the devs 2 different ways and haven't heard anything back. Google wouldn't refund me either. I played this game multiple times a day. It's one of my favorites but since they won't honor my purchase I won't honor a 5 star review. Shame on the devs",
        "Personally I love this game but be prepared to fail A LOT but once you had the game for a while you kinda get better!It's so much fun and addictive!! The only thing I don't like is all the ADDS there is soo many but still love the game 👍",
        "Honestly, i had to change my rating cause this app caused a heck of lag on my phone while it was sleep. Like simply i turned off the screen while playing the game and then tried to turn it back on, the phone was just simply non-responsive, took a while to turn the screen on and eventually caused the lock screen launcher to restart. Like really the app shouldn't be doing anything when my phone is sleep. Nexus 6P is my device just so u know.",
        "The game is fun and a great time killer, but it just lags too much, and there is too many ads. One second im on top of the leader board and the next, a person spawns on top of me! If these bugs were fixed, I'd gladfully give this game 5 stars, but for now, HORIBBLE!!!!"

        "Can you sponsor a video for me? I've introduced this game to several people and I have yet to hear it be exposed on youtube. As a creator I can give the game the exposure it deserves.",
        "The recent changes to the game bother me, you can no longer see how many points you get as you go or when you fail. Now it seems that they limit the amount of points you can get at the end for the moves you have left. The only time you see points is the total at the very end. Seems like they're screwing the people who want to get 3 stars on the levels...",
        "I enjoyed playing this game but I was to reset game to beginning.Tried clearing data and cache but didn't work.E-mailed developers to ask them and they e-mailed back saying they would but only once which I am still waiting for them to do.What is the big deal about wanting to start over the game again?Better that than once getting to levels you can't do to not play game again surely!!!!"

However when game is buffing or out of range they take the coins or if in bonus it kicks you out and money is lost and never returned nor does it place you back where you left off. PLEASE FIX THIS PROBLEM IMMEDIATELY! thank you. I still rate it 5 star cause I know you guys are going to handle it.",
        "at first was a blast but as any new slot game it tightens up and harder to level up. graphics are great but i will not buy coins on a daily basis in order to keep playing. so sad that this game turned out to be like the rest of them.",
        "Gameplay is interesting and sort of a hybrid of a Big-Fish-style game and those other too-many-blinky-lights and too-many-mission games. What irks me, though, is that you can't revert back to lower limits when your chips shrink. They may think that will make me buy chips, but they think wrong. One other thing: A game associated with NatGeo should be able to hire proofreaders and copy editors so that grammatical errors don't show up in the game.",

        "This game has been great to me forever, and I never had a complaint but this recent update has driven me here. The trophy cap is a real kick in the nuts and ruins the game for casual gamers like me. You now HAVE to advance through the games prestige system and keep resetting all your work just to help out a gang. And if you are in a strict gang like I am, they require 100 trophies a day. If I keep advancing, I won't be able to keep up with that. This is all a money grab by zepto now. They want you to have to pay to keep your machines strong so you can compete.",
        "I love this game. I have been playing it for a very long time. I play it every single day. I like the new updates however it seems you are getting away from the original game and focusing more on ultimate machines. Increasing the prestige levels was awesome but you need to also add additional upgrades with them as well. I have over 100 paw upgrades that are completely useless to me at the moment.",
        "Look this was a great game, worthy of it's previous accolades. Sadly since then it's been progressively ruined by an ever more aggressively enforced attempt to move to a pay to win model. Previously you could achieve anything in the game with a bit of hard work, then they tweaked it and you could achieve anything with a bit of hard work and team work. Sadly though what's happened is soft paywalls have been introduced, things you can't outright buy, but will only manage with financial outlay and change after change is being introduced with new soft paywalls and new ways to try and cash grab. The game is on a steady but rapid downward decline and to any new players I would avoid picking it up and investing your time in it now.",
        "Great game, easy to play and a good time waster. One thing I would like to see in a future update  is a scroll bar for the parts in your garage. It would make it a lot easier than swiping through them, especially for those who have a lot of spare parts like myself. Other than that, awesome game.",
        "This game sucks. First it is really hard to get good equipment. Then it is also very laggy. Everytime im playing the game it freezes right when im doing something. (Mainly when im customizing my car). Think about it when you are getting ths game to take up storage. If you'll excuse me now I've got a game to delete.",
        "I had a bad day but this game fixed it,... Well enough. I've bin looking for a good game to play for a couple months now but until, like 2 days ago nothing had shown its self to me or caught my interest! This game is 11/10 to me! For probably about the next two month!"

        "Whoa. I'm not a huge fan of the starting level, but the retro level is so perfect. I love the style of legacy, but It's too busy, so I can't tell where the obsitcles are. I love how you guys do the ads. If there's a car or level I want and I want to be lazy, I can just watch a couple ads to get it. Not only that, but It's my music. What a great idea. Kudos. I'm 100% on board.",

I also recorded myself playing because I would live to show this game up to the world and give a review. Really enjoy it and think it deserves to be spread out",
        "wow ! why is this game so good!! addicting I got a problem ! to many ads! I under stands u need money but you should put purchases so u get some more money !! and also I want to have new characters and themes that will be cool course I nearly got all but I haven't! also change rating to pegi 3 I know there's the characters can be a vampire but srsly IT'S NOT SCARY what is with wthat!  sorry it's long but thanks for taking time and reading bye!😀😀😀😁😁😁",
        "This adorable & addictive game is very fun to play at any time of the day! It is definitely a close competitor of the infamous\"Candy Crush\" trend. For such a simple concept, it never ceases to amaze me; especially since I can't seem to get a long enough winning streak to increase my stack count. I admit, I suck at this game... Yet I can't stop playing it! 4/5 stars for me. Loses a star for excessive ads and lagging during the game.",
        "I really liked it at first. But now all I get are ads. it's so irritating to be playing and then ad pops up at the bottom. You're clicking on your character to jump & you click on the stupid ad than every time you die you have to watch another ad so annoying. But I could get pass the ad      after you die but not at the bottom of the screen. Makes me not want to play it anymore. And I'm only on day 3. It was a cute to relieve stress and now it just gives me stress.",
        "Very very addictive pass time. Only a lil disappointed with the adds popping out every now and than. I know its a free app and adds are inevitable but try reducing the number of time it should appear not after each and every round.",
        "It's a very good game! I got my boyfriend hooked on it, but my problem with it is, sometimes when I start up the app it sits on the beginning stage of the app?? Like when am I going to be able to play again? Was just updated? So I'm going to have to delete it and start it all over and re gain my high score??"

        "I love to play hold em, but it's just to hard to round up the posse for poker night due to simply getting older. Life takes everyone n different directions. Not too mention, having kids and getting married, doing the family thing. Don't get me wrong, I absolutely love living the family life with my wife and kids but I will always miss poker night with the fellas. Now that I have stumbled upon WSOP I have been able to invite all of the fellas to join and we can all play together still once again. THANK U!!!!",
        "Seen to many players leave because of this. Players with over a billion in chips. Goes to a small table with players having 30k or 40k. Goes all in every hand and kills the table. Players ask him why he does it and not play bigger tables. His answer because game allows me to and I can knock out player after player. Regulate players if they have X amount of chips play on bigger tables. Let the smaller players gain chips and enjoy the game.",
        "It appears that I have reached a certain point where my free play is being met with bot resistance. I've gained over ten million in one day and lost it all and more in suck outs. This game is super fun whilst the going is good, but I fear the algorithms are programmed to entice you to pay real money, which of course you'd have to be mental to do once you realise how loaded this game is. Play for free = fun",
        "Win a bit and loose everything in a few hands...  Once you win a good hand, leave the table.  Dealer will not give a a chance.  After this review, I received an e-mail from the designer assuring me, that game is fair.  I have been losing several hands with pocket KK, QQ, JJ, and so for.  So I stand with my original review.   Win on a good hand and leave game.  Or else you will lose it ALL!",
        "This is a good game , only prob I have is there seems to some hackers/botting which makes it a little hard to play. Now as far as some people's comments even if the  people with a billion chips come to smaller tables , if you all knew how to play you wouldn't have to worry about them taking your chips. Trust me the majority of them started out at low tables also having to have to fight the ones with more money. I have been playing this game for a few years and love it.  Like I said only problem I have is to many bots/hackers.",
        "I really enjoy this game .At first I just added it for one of the games on app like to gain points for gift cards.And of course to learn how to play poker. Now if their no points given for this game I would still play it. I totally enjoy this game , and the people that play it. Its truly an enjoyable game. This game is a keeper know matter what.tthe only thing I wish is that their was more coins given ."

All other puzzle improve your skills but this isn't since you have no time to caulate the expression it's more a test of memory then calculation because you can only 3 star it if you know the expression by heart if you try workout you answer right but run out of time. You should make is so each correct answer adds time so you can accurately l improve. Also most games are broken with not enough time to do the given task and workout same as previous has no buttons so you can't play it.",

Star ratings give the game good replay value, and the workout mode is a nice addition for something short and sweet. Ads can get a bit annoying, but there's not too many and the pro version isn't that expensive anyway. As for the skill-building element, I can definitely see a difference in my attention and reflexes since playing. Overall, I would definitely recommend this game.",

        "The game sets a new high standard in bland average. THE DEAL ISN'T TRUE TO LIFE, IN ALMOST EVERY SINGLE HAND DEALT (in tournaments) THERE IS MULTIPLE ACES & PICTURE CARDS. However for a poker fan that doesn't know this game it's worth the gamble lol. The game play is good, poor player avatar customisation options as it's simply a small selection of picture options with zero options for using one's social media profile pic. This means frequently there are multiple players with the same profile pic. It struggles a bit as a social game of cards because conversation is limited by time, you can sit at slower tables allowing for better chat but not in tournaments. It has nothing to stand it out & above other poker game apps for either negative or positive reasons. If you just want to play a game of poker with random people from around the planet though it won't disappoint. It does give the option to buy top up chips and a daily option to get chips for free from both in game buddies and a poker machine. From the entertainment point of view it ticks all the right boxes but it's not the best poker game on Google's app store. If it was food you'd spit it out because it's bland, not sweet nor spicy but porridge without sugar or sweeteners.",

        "I enjoy this game a lot for their variety of games. I will say the starting bonus is very generous. The clubs are fun if you find a good one to be a part of. My only issue is the payout system... It seems when you make a decent win, your chances of winning anything are greatly reduced for a period of time,on any game or slots. No jackpot yet. The ads are not bad.. At all. I won't give up.. And I'm not the only one who notices the payout system.. I won't put my own money into this game just yet.. And if I run out I'll uninstall. But definitely give this one a try if ur looking for a good Casino Game.",
        "Warning careful with this game!  It's ok....hard to win anything. I 've spent quite a bit of money in this game. In the last week ALOT!!!! Both my Husband and I play I explained I could no longer seem to win anything . My Husband played on my device and his own, same room same exact bet. He spent a big sum, my device lost he could not win anything at all but he win 6 billion on his device. We had club members play exact game we was exact same bet, they won big my device won NOTHING AT all. Seems odd. Be Very Careful with this game. I do not believe something is right. After spending a VERY VERY LARGE SUM you would think a person could win a good sized jackpot. NOPE. I will not buy anymore.",
        "This game is very well choreographed. I like the theme music it plays . I like the fact that it give lots of hi winnings. The backgrounds are nicely colored. Very  adictive games. My favorite\"ZEUS SLOTS\". Not fair, I'm not getting some of my winnings. I will take off a star for that. But I still love this game. Although I have been playing this game for a while, and it has improved alot. Now my favorite games are HERCULES, THE MUMMY, and the DIAMONDS SLOTS, and the FRUIT SLOTS. Now I LOVE this game. Some of the game slots needs to up beat the music. Some games are slow, sleepy music. I have always loved this game. Its a lot of fun. It keeps me motivated. My newest favorite game yet is\" WILD STARS\"  . However, \"ZEUS\" I feel that it need to update its amount of pay. And add different characters and music. Love the action😄. This is always an exciting game.😉Ah, always an awesome game.😆This is a wonderful game to play when your on vacation. Just awesome. I love this game, exciting wins. This will always be my favorite game.",
        "Enjoyable game, lots of freebies.  I now need to change up my review.i had made a purchase in the game during a \"Spin and Win\" promotion, that purchase stated that I would receive 10m chips for every 2k league points, at end of promotion, I did not receive any of my chips as promised per promotion advertising. I followed the process of getting in touch with Huuuge Casino and was told once that someone would be in touch with me, as of this listing I still have not heard back from anyone.",
        "So i liked the game enough to over look the constant in app purchase ads and advertisments that are timed perfectly to get you to accidently tap them. But what just made me uninstall this game was this: Twice now i have hit raise or bet in texas hold em' and instead the game folds my very obvious winning hand. Whether it is a technical issue or not, i dont care. There are better games out there that dont have this issue, and i suggest you play those instead of this one.  Phone Specs: Galaxy S7, fully updated OS, apps, etc., Verizon service provider.",
        "I have always been a loyal player at huuuge casino and can safely conclude I will continue for a long long long time. Why I said this? Simple - huuuge casino has such a wide varieties of games to satify all sorts of players. Huuuge from my experience not only practise fair play policy but also quite generous in giving free chips.  My plea to the great support team - please do the needfull to bring back Merlin Casino, Melbourne Casino and Singapore Casino. Texas hold'em held there were really superb and loved by many players. I don't understand why they vanished after maintenance works were completed.  My many thanks to the support team - you guys are good! Keep up the good work and CHEERS to all of you."

        "Love it. Been playing for over a year. You can earn gems slowly to get premium characters or spend money to get them. However you do not need premium characters to play the game. I think people forget that your \"FREE\" games have to make money some how to pay developers, animators, IT support and more. Either they have dozens of ads everyday (DK has a few but not dozens) or premium paid content.",
        "Most addictive game! Playing it since it 1st started. Love the new mystery event it's so adorable except your missing one vital character!!  I think there's a couple points to improve on... the send home button in the characters actions list I think should be up the top and smaller instead of scrolling down for it cos I use it often. 2nd all of the sounds in my game are very poor, it's nearly always silent and music is always late. Haven't heard the high 5 sound in ages 😔 please fix the sound!",
        "This game is amazing! I love it so much! It just reminds me of my childhood, and of all of the TV shows I used to watch. I have only 1 problem with this game, it does not count time when you go out of the game or close your phone. It might just be me, but if it wasn't for the bad saving, I would have given this game 5 stars, since it deserves it, or even more.",
        "The game is fun and all, but do you think you guys could get this game optimized for the Lenovo tablets? I had to get a new tablet since previous one broke. Now the game keeps closing out on me when I'm trying to do something. Think you guys can fix this somehow?  I'd appreciate it if you do. Thanks in advance.",
        "Fantastic graphics, great controls, overall great game.  Recommended to my friends child.  Some tasks  (i.e., leveling up a character, waiting to clearing a curse, waiting to open a chest...) take too long and their is nothing to do while you wait.  Game has improved tremendously! Love the game, won't stop playing. Thank you Disney!",
        "This game has given me nothing but problems. Every update has to have a glitch. First there was a problem when ever I tried to open a chest. Then an update came and After that update now the consetion stands close out the game anytime I want to view. Now with winnie the poo update the whole dam game is slow. Seriously thinking of quiting. It doesn't matter every update has a glitch. Can't u guys fix it? Or is just me?"

        "Great little game except i downloaded it to play in a quiet place but after turning off music and sound it over ride the settings. I also put my phone mute on and it still played music on ads and when pressing the arrow button in the game. Not impressed",
        "The ads in this game made it unplayable. I used to love this game and I downloaded it to try playing again and I would get minute and a half ads after every third attempt at a level. It felt like nearly every time I failed a level it would ask me if the level was too hard and I needed a hint. This game is incredibly obnoxious to play with ads on",
        "Well i would give this five stars but you cant watch an add to get a power up! And you should lower the ad mount of adds i cant go in for 10 seconds without an add popping up!! Overall good great game",
        "Way too many ads after every time I lose or go onto another level an advert pops up. Verry annoying. But the gameplay is decent.",
        "Look, I understand that you have to make money somehow, and ads are how you make money on a free game. But these ads are way too frequent and obnoxious. I listen to podcasts while playing games and every minute or so my sound cuts out completely to prioritize the ad. Earn the ad by giving me a decent amount of playtime before it and stop overriding my audio.",
        "I like the game itself but when you have 3 adds coming up after one game you hardly can enjoy the game. Super annoying, so if you download it for free be prepared to buy it otherwise it will drive you crazy!"

Why cant you put an option to watch 5 ads a day for 10 coins each ad or something? Its annoying being interruoted every ten seconds by something i dont care about. Other than that, the game is pretty good itself and its fun to play.",
        "Cheetah Games, I hope you see this, because I've got a complaint. I've been playing piano tiles 2 for about 2 days and I'm level 11 or 12 I don't remember. However when I was leveling up I noticed that a song I like was missing from Level oh I don't know 5, 6, 7, I don't really know. I was looking for a song called the swan, and I could not find it. Then I went to a different tab in songs and I found it it wasn't in level 5, 6, or 7, but it was in level 65. When I found out about this, my favorite song being in level 65 which I will never get to because I'm not that patient, I nearly broke my phone for I was so enraged because of this change. Please change it back it's my favorite song. I hope you got this  but I know you don't.",
        "Great time killer! On those nights I can't sleep, which is too often, this is the best app to turn my would be long night into an extremely short night. The time literally flies and before I know it morning is here. Couldn't ask for a more fun,challenging and interesting way to pass the time. But be careful, you will become addicted very quickly!",
        "It is amazing no matter what I play this alot and still love it. Has great graphics great gameplay and I will never get bored. If I had to have one game on my phone except YouTube this would be my number one game so keep going but one thing you should make lots of more songs like really new songs",
        "This app is great for passing time, I also love how you can play offline. Its very addicting as well. The only downside is that there are way to many advertisements, I can't even play one song without there being an ad",
        "I mean the game is great! But all of these add-on power up stuff always being added ends up ruining the classic game for me. I love the good original design, no power-ups or anything too extra. I don't use them and find them annoying. It's a great time killer, and a real challenege.  But, as said before, the game is going too extra and I don't really like it.  Playing it is fun, the add-ons are not."

        "HI SUPERCELL . some players ruined the clan because of Clan Games. Why? They will join ur clan and check if we already achieve the reward like book. They will earn 50 or 100 points and leave the clan. Pls do something about this issue. The CG rules should change like They will get the reward depend of how many points they earnd. Sample: 1500 points they get the reward from tier 1-3 even though the clan achieved the last tier. Pls fix it. Thanks",

The game is too hectic and the gravity is too much compared to the last update. It's a really good idea but I hope this isn't just a quick grab for cash.",
        "Having to restart the app every time you want to play instead of being able to hit RESTART sucks.  The app won't let you restart a game without a glitched ball each time.  Also, the speed of the ball is ridiculously inconsistent.  Sometimes you get games that are at a reasonable speed and other times it seems like the ball speed has increased an unreasonable amount to play.  Why even bother trying to load the game each time anymore?",
        "The game is extremely broken. I can't start a game without falling off the map, and there are times when I don't even play it's a blank screen and my points meter goes up. It's a very broken game I'm thoroughly disappointed.",
        "it is extremely broken. after the first death, it starts you out right in front of the start platform and you cant play it again unless you completely close the app. its a shame that they dont even test the game before they launch it and that google play cant prevent it from launching in the first place. great game, but extremely broken.",
        "Poor quality game that wasn't tested before release! After your first death you can't land on the platform upon restarting and immediately die, the only way to have another go is to completely close the app first."

Also 9 roses a day is not enough roses should at least rollover if only 9 are going to be given. There is also a lot of account trading and account merging going on. Clans are bullying other members into taking over their account and forcing members out of their clan leader positions. This is a very expensive game and these are very unacceptable things that members should not have to deal with",

I have requested a working link or a copy of your refund policy on the 15th of March 2018 at the time of purchase. Google have advised me to first make a review to speak with you direct before taking further action.  I have contacted your company via email, fb line and attempted whatsapp. You have responded a little to fill surcharge on account and then performed malicious and negligent to any other request I've made. Google have also tested your refund policy and witnessed it's not there or working. I look foward to a response that meet my requests.  As reported before edited I have contacted your fb, your whatsapp, your email and line contact and have been ignored. I have copies of all conversations.  I love how you deny any request for your refund policy and sanction bans. This is unlawful activity and any customer who has been threatened of a ban or banned should report this app.",

After you collect everything, there's nothing else you can do, I believe there are many ideas that Voodoo can implement.",
        "I love this game. It really helps if you have anxiety problems like i do. Plus its too adictive not to play. If you could add more powers then that would be great. Plus i love the way you can upgrade your tank and choose what perk you want. My favourite is power as it helps alot during sticky situations like when you have three layers of 13K health blocks!!! Altogether a fun addictive game that kills time!!!",
        "Every now and then the application would randomly shut down and have to be restarted. You cannot have more than 2.15 billion points to spend at a time but you can earn as many points as you would like, but you still don't have more than 2.15 billion points to spend. This game is still very addictive, I am level 1,000 for shooter speed and level 600 for shooting power.",
        "It's a great game but there is too many ads. Every time a games ends, it pops to and ad. The game is s good play and you can just sit in the middle, do nothing and not move to collecting points to up grade. That's because the course repeats, not very challenging.",
        "WAY TOO MANY ADS.  What ever happened to the basic app based games with a banner ad, and that's it?  This interrupts game play so badly, its No longer fun.  See 2084 for the way these simple games should be designed.",
        "The gameplay is pretty good. Although it doesn't feel like you're .aking any progress because the game will just keep getting harder. The reason why i rated it 1 star, is because of the ads. There is an ad every single tome after you die. I just couldnt take the ads"

        "Great game This is a wonderful game, with great gameplay, amazing aesthetics and highly addictive. Totally worth the $2 for the premium version. I do have one problem though: even though I am pretty decent at the game, Google Play won't give me any achievements even though I'm sure I have earned some. It won't even let me open achievements or leaderboard pages. Is anybody else having this issue?",
        "I came across this app while I was browsing for more games. Looks very well designed and I've decided to make room for this app. The very first time I played this game my mind was literally blown. Awesome music, fantastic design/graphics and very creative gameplay. It gave me a very good first impression that within 30 minutes into the game I've upgraded to premium. The different game modes accomodate various type of players. The challenges are reasonable. Literally every aspect of this game is a success. The premium upgrade is worth every cent. Who need ads if you can give a very good first impression. A simple yet sophisticated game. Very well done indeed, a must for time killer!",
        "There are so many good things to list about this game. First, the graphics are extordinarily beautiful. And how much this game can relax you is AMAZING! When I play this, I swear my stress is gone. This game is never stressful. I find it amazing how satisfying this game is. I also love how realistic this game it is. The veiw and echoing is what really make up this game. Every sound is perfect for the setting. You need to download this NOW!",
        "Really fun and addicting! The first time i saw this app was when my dad told me about this game, he said that it was very good. Literally the first 10 minutes i played this game my mind was blown and i beacame addicted. Around 2 years later(now) i found this game again and instantly installed it. I love this game and I have played it for a long time. The graphics and music are amazing. This a really good game and you should install it! Who could think that glass could be so fun. However I think this game would be better if some of the thing you have to pay for would be for free.",
        "Great game, but premium is almost a requirement. The game itself is great, with an uber-cool, never-seen-before concept of smashing glass with metal balls in mysterious dimensions. The only problem is that getting premium is almost a requirement if you want to do well in the game. You can't continue the level once you die without paying. I would rate this game five stars if it weren't for this.",
        "So fun Great graphics and its super fun and addictive especially if you like beating your own score. I gave 4 stars because I paid the 2 dollars for the full version but I find that it doesn't save where I'm at very well... Like if I leave the game and come back to it the last level I completed won't be saved. Other than that its really awesome and challenging. Hope I can get past level 8!"

        "I'm not a downloading games on my phone or tablet kind of person but I saw this game and decided to try it out. I loved it and played it all the time but then one day it suddenly stoped working when I was doing so well. I couldn't open the game anymore I tried many things and didn't work. I started a new game all from the beginning I had 55 cash in my town and all randomly it showed I had like 20. This game just wants you to keep making purchases. If you don't it will block you out.",
        "I love this game. I dont play a lot of games. Township just keeps getting better. Some things are a minor downfall to this game, like how you can usually get great items from the store, untill you need a product or item for a task or event item. Then unless you have the township cash to hire the dealer then its hard to get things done in time. Plus in order to complete some tasks, you have to sell everything in your barn to complete the task. You should be able to just harvest than sell without it subtracting it back from your task. But either than that its an awesome game...",

Greetings we're all gussied up for the holidays. It's Easter season 2018 still playing.",
        "Loved this game but I can't seem to get on the game now. I wait for a long time for it to start and have to sometimes uninstall and reinstall and wait for it to start again.  If It I do make it on I can't help other players by going to there town. I paid money on this game and play faithfully everyday. I'm feeling some kind of way about this. Please fix this.  Update: The bugs are fixed..Thank you",
        "It is fast pace and complex good for ny age,but it with it ads and constant up daes it is hard on your device. It can be played with out any cost, if one has the time and the patients. Other wise it can be costly.  If it a child playing it I would highly recommend supervision,not because of any other reason other than updates and complex issues.  But it is a thnking ame that is fun.",
        "This is one unique blend of many things made into a game that makes me feel obligated to keep coming back and keeping everything running in the game. It doesn't feel like this when I played HayDay. One highlight I have to mention, game cash (township cash) is generously given away in many form! No more worry of being unable to achieve this and that due to no cash available..."

        "Great game. Everything you could want in a game. Castle building, PvP. Unique equipment with special stats. Different attack types, economy classes. Rewards are rewarding enough. So far 5/5. The theme is good. The balance seems reasonable. My only suggestion is making to character limit for name changes bigger for the dwellers/subjects. Only thing I can constructively suggest. Or be able to type first and last name.",
        "After playing for a few hours this I find this game good my only problem is that you need to pay for those epic drops? I mean in a game if you defeated the boss those are supposed to be yours without paying, I can accept paying for 1 dollar but the second boss requires me to purchase it for almost $3 I already paid for premium I don't want to pay for other things. Please make the drops free for premium members or have them cheap or totally free, or else after my premium I'll quit this game.",
        "I loved this game very much, I had a lot of really nice things and invested nearly $60 dollars into making my guys 5 stars and diamonds and other level up promos... I was the clan leader of the \"Bananna Kings\" my main complaint is my phone rebooted and now I've lost everything... my game, my victories, my clan, and all the money I invested in this great game... please help. ;( my username on my good account is \"Skylark\"",
        "Loved playing the game, I just wish there was a balance in the PvP Tournaments, can't find a tournament where everyone else isn't 20000 Points over my guys. Please fix this!! Just put a bloody +/-5000 points deviation on it! Make it more enjoyable for people who don't buy everything they see",
        "best game on mobile i think. just make sure your account is linked to your facebook and google play so you dont ever lose your account i almost lost everything when my phone broke. luckly i got it to turn on for a bit before going off and linked my accounts. now im fine..",
        "This game is all pay to play. You can't compete without dumping a bunch of money into it. So like an idiot I put some money into the game and sure enough. It matched me with guys 10 times stronger then me. There's no winning unless you plan to put a lot of money into it. Which I will not be doing. Uninstalling"

        "Amazing game!! I have purchased 1 or 2 bikes already, I would even pay to get new bikes, but it is very expensive. Please consider lowering to prices or making better bikes more accessible. Ive been stuck on the same level for 5 weeks. I want to continue playing but im loosing intrest not being able to advance. Maybe you could trade your old bikes in to get something in return for a newer bike. Im sure you will never read this, but you do have something special here! Thanks",
        "Very fun BMX pump game. Seen a few reviews say it's gets impossible after level 3 when it becomes pay to win. I don't agree I've just reached level 8 in a few hours. If you ride bikes off road and understand how to pump you'll love it",
        "Its way to hard to win and and the stats do nothing.  You have to be perfect and even then they fly by.  Still LOVE this game.  Just takes away the fun when you get left in the dust and you play the same lvl a million times hoping maybe one time you will be perfect.",
        "I loved this game for 3 days. Then it got to the point where I couldn't beat a level without upgrading my bike, but I couldn't upgrade my bike without spending real money. So disappointing. Don't waste your time if you don't want to spend real money!",
        "The game is fun up until around the third level. After that it becomes near impossible to win any races without spending actual money to upgrade your bike. Had a lot of fun with it up until that point, but it's definitely not worth spending actual money on. Deleted the game after pay to win clearly became a necessity.",
        "It was fun for a while - until it becomes impossible to beat any opponents with your current bike. The difficulty spikes around level 7 and the process of buying a new bike or upgrading your existing one becomes very frustrating, as you can't win any races to earn any money."

        "Oh my gosh. This game is one of the best. It literally like a normal school. You jave schedules. You can do ballet class, hip hop class, latina class and finally jazz class. You can go to diffrent places to get outfit,makeup and hair done. They actually give you a report card with all your classsess and grade. You can peform in front of an audience and you can battle people at the battle arena. Finally my favorite part of this game BOY DRAMA AND GIRL DRAMA it's amazing. DOWNLOAD THIS GAME RIGHT NOW!!!!!!!!!",
        "I love the quality of the game. Great time killer.Brings out my inner Ballerina lol. Easy, Fun.Game The only thing so far i dont like is wadrobe. For example If your swiching btwn classess its hard to complety take off i.e jacket, tights or pants from previous classes. If u pick certain outfits there stuck on you. Please fix. Other then that good game.",
        "I'm not much of a dance gamer but I love simulation games. This one in particular is very innovative with their design and gameplay. I was skeptical of how I was going to like it at first but it proved me wrong and I immediately took to it. The controls are easy to learn and I don't even mind all of the ads. Honestly, a really great game.",
        "I love this game! It is really fun and if you like dancing then this is the one for you! Personally I like gymnastics more but that's because I've come a long way in it. The only thing that you could change is the amount of ads are! There are so many of them! But over all this game is great! 😉😉",
        "Honestly, one of the best games that I ever played. Dont care much for the ads. Just turn off your data and none of the ads will come out😉 But just like what the other reviewers are saying, the option to choose and take off certain clothes are limited. But other than that, great game.",
        "This game is actually good. The biggest downside is that there's A LOT OF ADVERTISEMENT to watch during playing. I know this is a free game, but c'mon! Waiting and watching minutes of the advertisement is longer than playing the game itself. Not to mention the conversation between characters in the game also took too long to wait and there's some things need to use real money before it can be explored.  This kind of game supposed to be fun and gives the cha cha feeling, but instead I get frustrated of waiting for the advertisement to finish before I can continue playing.  Out of all that, this game is great."

        "I've liked this game for years. Some adjustments needed: realistically if gas goes empty and you're still coasting or you're in the air you should be able to coast until the vehicle completely stops or lands before the game stops. You've had the nitros in now which is great. However, you still haven't fixed the previous issue. IF I CAN COAST OR NITRO BOOST MYSELF TO A GAS CAN THAT'S LOGICAL. However, you stop the game before the vehicle stops moving which is in a sense, removing logic, and the law of motion!",
        "The best racing game ever, I've played this game along time ago. the first version it has 4/5 cars it was so fuuun.That was 5 years ago now I want to play it again.I feel the nostalgia ooohh the good old days.Now I'm going to install the game.U guys change my life Thank u guys soo much guys. I hope my tears will help u guys. :)",
        "Maybe some new vehicles? Taxi. Limo. Tow truck. Hearse.... maybe some new stages too? Under water. Race track. Bridges. Derby. Graveyard.  I originally posted this way back in 2015 and yet you said you are constantly improving the game??? We try and give you the developer new ideas but it seems that no one bothers to read our comments? I guess it's just a lack of interest. Hopefully this time someone will read it............",
        "For this game to be so simple compared to todays games and grafics, I love it. I spend hours sometimes playing this.  Not to mention they keep upgrading and making it beter and better, keep it up fellas....i havent experienced any of the problems mentioned withthe updates others have but until then great game",
        "Best game ever. I play it all the time even at work but people look at me stupid because im trying to keep from dying and tilting my phone like a moron.. Please make my efforts not be in vain!",
        "Its a very good game without any tension of wining any difficult task...I like it very much and its not much addicting I have played many games but its very different. controls are also good but this game needs some practice . I am enjoying this game because the tasks are not very difficult but at the same time not very easy its a perfect game and the main character of the game is very funny he always sleeps in the vehicle.....so finally.... I like this game very much"

        "Awesome game! Only issue is on season 7. Race with save 8 seconds on perfect drift.... it says 3 laps but one lap doesn't count so you have to do 4 laps and you can never save 8 seconds. When crossing finish line game keeps playing and doesn't finish, time runs out and you've lost. Please fix",
        "The car will control itself... If you hold left it will turn left for a period but will start to try and straighten up... To test is on lvl 1 first corner accelerate and turn left (any set of controls tried all) it will start turning right seems to be when the prospective changes. Looks like it would be good if it went where you tell it to. Might be due to latest patch so will try again if it get fixed",
        "Awesome Game... no need to spend money to get best cards you can easily earn them... Can play offline too... There is a glitch though in season 7 - save 8 second stage... even after finishing it wont give 3 stars and fails me.",
        "Good game, really fun. On season 7 the 6th drift game you cant pass it. When you cross the finish line it says wrong way and doesnt let you finish the gane to get the last star. You end up doing 4 laps, even with 20 secnonds still on the clock. Please fix the issue so I can complete the season",
        "Kinda hate the drift feature, like the car just auto drifts in the direction u turn. This gets annoying too since u can't turn normally when needed and the car just starts drifting, making u hit more obstacles. Graphics are good, my phone can handle the very high settings so I haven't played on the lower settings.",
        "Love the game. However, after finishing the race, an ad pops up and after closing it, the screen is all black and it stays that way. It happened to me a number of times. The stage is complete but I didn't get any of the cash rewards or the cards. Please fix this or at least give me the rewards I didn't get. Will give it a 5 stars then."

        "Great start! No glitches. Performs smoothly! One of the best games on Android!! Must download Belive me I have never spent a single penny of \"real\" money and the game has never been unfair to me. Its really very good game. They found a sweet spot to balance both paid and free players. You just need to go on playing. I got the costliest robot of the market for free. Keep playing you'll eventually be strong enough and then you'll never stop to play.",
        "I really hated this game at first, when i was trying it on a friend's phone. It has really grown on me since then, i love it. I've been playing it for years now and still love it; the graphics are amazing, the game play is smooth, my clan is great, there's always new stuff to do or new bots/weapons to acquire. Yes, there are some people playing that kinda ruin a battle for your team but Hey, it's just a game and you still get points if you lose. Do your best and have fun.",
        "After being so long on the game I can see that the development team behind this game is pretty committed. I can see they really put effort into debugging, improving and renewing some elements of the game, I've decided to increase the star counts for War Robots (This is the original one). It's one heck of a game for mobile device I can tell you that. As for attaining the \"best robots\" or the \"best weapons\" in the game, it's hard but it's not impossible.  Just take part in the festive events... and you don't neccessarily need the \"best bots\" to annihilate your opponents...",
        "Supposed random game is not random. You only win the lowest prices until you start spending gold.  Black market is the same. Also it will take you a decade before you get the best robots unless you shell out your hard earned money. I hope the drop off scheme would earn me points, however it's just for one type of robot.",
        "This game is very much Pay to Win. So expect some people to crush you.  All the \"gambling\" games are fixed to make sure you get the lowest possible reward. Don't waste your gold gambling. All that said this game is worth 5 stars just for the gameplay. The graphics are amazing and the game is fun even when you end up against someone spending hundreds of real dollars on robots and gear. Be patient. You may not always win or do well but in time you can give all but the most hardcore spenders a run for their money (all pun intended)",
        "It will be cool if we can upgrade not  just one robot but all!! And pls double the gold I rlly need it right now for just 1 orkan And also why is it so hard to get a weapons like with puzzle logo on it it's like 10,000 can you imagine that! If I made the game I would do just 6,000 or 5,000! One more make a single player like player vs AI and it will say easy medium hard"

        "I have only had the game a few hours and I am already falling in love with it. It is great to go on when you have a spare 10-15 minutes. The grid is larger than others so I can read the words fluently and quickly without them being hard to see. You get points after each time you complete the grid so if you are really stuck you can receive a hint for some points. I would highly recommend this excellent game.",
        "Only been playing for a few days now, and so far, I love it! Forgot how fun Word Search puzzles can be, and to have it on my phone is priceless lol.. No complaints with the app so far. I will say though, maybe they should tweak it just a tad, instead of giving a hint only after a short moment, possibly creating 'the option' to have a hint may be a little better. Not a big deal to me. It truly is a great app, love the simplicity of the graphic design too. Glad I came across this game.",
        "I enjoy ALMOST the whole game, being a word find and all, simple, yet deceptively hard at times. Still, I wish there was a way to turn off the 'hints' it gives, as they get annoying... unless there IS a way that I haven't discovered yet...otherwise, I REALLY like the game, and would suggest it to all ages, as it's not too tough for the young ones, but still challenging enough for experienced players.",
        "Pretty good word search game. It's sometimes hard to hit the right letters, especially toward the bottom of the screen. Occasionally words share more than one letter in common. Sometimes  (especially in the  lower levels) a word will show up more than  once in a puzzle. Maybe extra credit for finding a word that's not on the list?",
        "It's a good game but there needs to be a way to turn off hints. If you don't find a word in the time it thinks you should, it keeps giving hints which ruins the gameplay. I pause for various reasons like talking to someone, cat catching a mouse, watching tv at the time, etc.. Or sometimes it might take longer to fins a word than seconds allowed before the hint.",
        "I love this game. Really nice and well thought out game. It's educative too. But I have just one issue with it though: The flashing hint. This gets me distracted each time it flashes. Maybe there could be a hint button at the bottom of the puzzle. That way instead of it flashing and getting us distracted, we could just click on it whenever we need help. Apart from that, it's just perfect. Will give it a 5 when the flashing hint is worked on😁"

Cause you can't do nothing with left over coins in each state. Other than that, it keeps me ready for any challenge.",
        "I absolutely loved it compared to the other games because it's absolutely free with literally thousands of levels and different menus (so you don't get bored)... It's a great balanced of easy and challenging (but still achieveable without spending a single cent)... My only complaint is that every now and then it hangs (but that's quite rare)... Great job!",
        "The game is fun when it works. Every time I unlock a new restaurant or a new region or bonus level or ANYTHING it won't download. I get a \"connection error\", and the only way to get past it is to delete the game, re-download EVERYTHING (which clocks in at over 100mb) and try again. Update 3/15: I emailed the devs over a month ago and have yet to get even an automated response.",
        "After all changes in Dublin its n impossible to win levels without purchasing spoons and boosts. It was a great game but it slowly got ruined by the greedy developres i guess. Well..guess what! I am not spending a dime on it and I will just stop play it.",
        "This game is fun, but it would be much better if they make it so that you can watch video ads so that you can get more spoons, boots, and lives. You can only watch a video once or twice for a life. I definitely won't spend my actual money to play this game. It's not a home counsel game.  Also, this game gets difficult quickly. I'm in the Paris level and barely making it through. I like to play this game for fun and to pass time. But the difficulty increases makes it not as fun.",
        "I love this game but the fact that you can't use coins to buy spoons really annoys me. I wish they at least had an option to convert coins to different currency so that you can buy stuff in the next locations. What are you meant to do with your coins after you've finished the city?? It's such a waste."

Then I noticed that they changed the looks and now it looks horrible and stupid I was disappointed by this plus to many damn ads! PS unupdate the app the older version was better the new one sucks!!",

        "The game itself is pretty good. But the thing is, there is a point to where it is to much ads. I bet that u make money every time some1 sees an ad on in your game, but u won't make any money if that person stops playing the game because of how much ads. I have been playing this game for 10 minutes and already come across around 100 ads. I might take away some of that cash income because the amount of ads Is insane. Would u rather make No Money, or A decent bit of money?",
        "The game could be better if you tone down the ads a bit more... Maybe 10 games one ad? Or maybe more? Its really annoying when you get ads every end of the round.",
        "To many adds ❎❎❎❎❎❎ corny characters. and finnaly very stupid. This game should be fun because of the adds but it has to much adds for me to have.😲😒👹👺💀☠👊"

        "Great game with fun objectives that keep it challenging until level 15.  Only issue with it is that ive recently lost all.my gems due to some sort of bug and now i dont really want to continue playing just to get back to 500 gems to experience something other than sky summit.",
        "I like it and it is a good game, except now I have no sound and the videos do not leave the screen so I can spin the wheel. The sound on the game is on and the last time it worked properly was 3 days ago. I have to shut down the game for me to get the ads gone and still no sound. I have lost many chests and many coins this way. I updated the game and still nothing. Please fix because I have no idea what is going on.",
        "I have enjoyed this game for a couple of years wirh no problems. The only thing I can complain about is earning so many coins and jems and not having anything to buy with them such as new characters and powerups. It's a good hand eye game.",
        "Ok I'm mad I got a new phone. There is no way to save progress. I lost 1,000 gems and 2 million coins. This is BS. They should make it so u can connected thru Facebook like most of the other games. Get it together temple run 2",
        "I abosulutly love this game. It won't get a 5 star though because I have had 4 different coin skins get taken away from me and those were actually my favorites. Idk if it was a glitch or I didn't do something but plz tell me what it is",
        "The blazing sand map is really boring. Only 3 different location there. But looks same all the entire run. Make some free space. It is very boring to run in sand all the time. Make variation like Frozen Shadows atleast. Add some location. Make some variations."

        "Almost two years later and still love the game. It is a good game to relax to. I do spend money occassionally on the game but the game is not \"pay to play\". That means you can progress through it without even spending a dime. Its a simple game with decent graphics to play at leisure and has become my current pass time.  Update 3/22/18  I decreased my rating to three stars (from 5) until the developer can correct the latest flop from most recent update. Flop regards being able to log in but paralyzed from any action that requires an in game pop up. I including the \"Help\" module which is used to contact dev with. If no improvement after a week, I will delete game and draw stars to 0.",
        "I've always loved this game, but my tickets go ignored for days. Latest update has handicapped me completely in that I cannot click on anything or log off 1 world to log onto my other world. The game is starting to suffer because of bad customer service. Reduced my rating to 1 star until they get their act together. To think I've actually spent real money on this game and can't get a timely answer.",

I cannot even access the second world I play in because I am locked into Uceria. I have uninstalled and reinstalled,but still does not work. Please help!",

        "This game is great! Though there are things I would change about the new race mode and some things in arcade mode. For example, instead of having to pay a dollar USD to cut the rope tire, why not pay a thousand coins to get rid of it for the next 5 or 10 times it needs to show up, and have us pay the dollar to get rid of it for good. And in arcade, if you accidentally missed your reward,why not have it double the next reward rather then keep the amount the same all the time, otherwise, I wouldn't change a thing besides those two things, I love it ^^",
        "The climbing game is the only thing I hate, it's such BS. My knife will slide and hit a branch after it went into the wood. That's not supposed to happen. But overall great game.",
        "Not perfect but it's really good, hate the tires though, not willing to pay any amount of money to remove them. It would be better if after 1-5 thousand score on race, the tire would be removed or maybe throw a knife 10 times through the tire and it would be gone. Kinda silly to pay to  remove something that would make for much better gameplay if the player could play the game and earn it gone. (Mostly doing this for the 500 coins but this is an honest review)",
        "Great visuals, smooth physics, and addicting Gameplay. Great game, my only thing I'd change would be the end-game knives, past 10k all the knives kinda suck, and have awful 'flipability', making it pointless to save up for anything above 10-15k. If you added a better variety of knives into the game this would be a 5 star.",
        "Please devs, read that. You are losing the point here. The game should be good and exciting so we can support you, and not irritating and frustrating. The knives always hit with the sharp part and it is not always that it hang on the wood. It seems it is a matter of luck/random result of some algorithm. Now if that matter of luck wasn't enough, we need to dodge an annoying tire, or just pay to have it removed. Instead of pay because we like the game we should pay to play? Put a price in the game and all knives available to buy with the game money and I buy it. Let it as it is now and you won't ever see any cent from me, not even from ads because I only play it offline. I refuse to watch any ad even if I could increase a reward in 10x.",

Second, the controls don't suck, they are just wobbly, but that is the point. Without the difficult turning, the game would be too easy. With that all said, this game is pretty fun.",

The only reason this game has so many player is the game size & device compatibility. If your phone is capable of playing \"the famous 3v3 moba\", you'd better play that game",
        "I love this game, I've been playing this for over a year and I still play it daily! All the skins and heroes skills are amazing. But please don't  let me team up with low level players it's affecting my game and stats when I'm trying my best to carry they would just afk which can be frustrating. But overall it's a good game",
        "I hv been playing this game for two years alll good perfect game perfect graphics..bt there should be some changes for the afk players... strict steps should be taken towards for these afk players not bye lowering credit score by banning from game for a period of time so that they won't be spoiling game any further",
        "I love the game and everything about it, but however there is a issue which I get reported for and lose credit because of it.   The game client keeps restarting itself whenever I find a match, leaving other players to report me thinking i'm AFK or DC'D  I've gotten alot of Penalty messages and lost credit because of it, I also can't play a single game because the client keeps restarting!  Please do Fix",
        "I connot open now what happen i change my acount and then theres no open... why always say  sorry your mobile legend is not carrently avaliable in your country or region..... why? I always use this game because its really fun, but i always get the bugs please fixed my mobile legend."

BUT - I payed for levels 13 and 14 , and the game does not allow me to play in random order - it's not possible to play no. 23 without finishing all numbers before. If you are stuck in some number, you cannot go to another one - you MUST BUY hint!!! It means - you PAID for the game, but you MUST PAY again for hint - or you are blocked in PAID  game. It's just not fair.",
        "A lot of Numberlink programs have \"fake\" puzzles - they have multiple solutions unless additional non-standard \"rules\" are followed... which are NEVER fun. This app doesn't do that. These are the real deal, and are VERY satisfying to solve. The price is extremely low for the quantity and quality on offer; I highly recommend this game.",
        "I loved flow free from a young age. I've played until 9×9 pack but when I reached a certain level,  the game stopped working after that and I've tried over and over again to go in but the game just keeps bring me back to the home screen and keeps stopping. Please fix it. I really want to play the remaining levels and packs",
        "Great game. Keep coming back to it. I find it relaxing solving the puzzles, though it has become super easy! All versions are great. All in all, awesome job! One of my favourites, and works in any situation. Quick break at work, something productive ? Play. Something to do before sleep? Play. Got a few extra mins? Play! Wanna challenge yourself on timed? Play! Haha.",

The original starts to get boring after awhile, but with all the different variations they come out with, it never gets old. A very fresh experience with one of the recent updates, feels much more refined when compared to the one I used to play.",
        "Simple yet clever, Free Flow is about connecting brightly colored dots together without crossing the lines. With an abundance of board shape, size, variety, and difficulty, there's something in free play to challenge nearly everybody. Those who find even the largest puzzles too easy may alternatively challenge themselves in time trials to finish the boards as quickly as possible."

        "Not worth it. The stories are TERRIFIC.  problem is you can only have 1 ticket per hour. If you wait 2 hours for 2 tickets your still going to get 1. The only way u could have more than 2 is if u purchase . So for that reason I'm installing sorry I can't wait that Long and sometimes I'm barely active and can only read 1 chapter is just not my thing.",
        "This is a great game. But everytime I try to open the game it crashes. Not to mention I just bought lots of tickets to read the chapters and now I can't use them because the game keeps crashing. Either fix this or give me my money back.",
        "To make your own choices.... You need gems!   Well too bad there's no way to get more free gems.  You get 1 gem for reading a chapter.  But that's not near enough to actually make the choices you want.  If that was fixed and you could get more free gems,  game would be more awesome",
        "The stories can get a bit addicting. However, the tickets you need to read them are ridiculous. I can go to sleep, wake up, and only have one ticket. It says you can speed up to get another ticket by watching adds. That's OK. But I've watched so many adds and haven't received even one ticket for them. Honestly debating on deleting it. Seems like a big waste to have to wait so long. Especially when you like to read the stories. There's a couple apps that are better. And you can get further with. It seems the only way to actually enjoy this app the way I want to is to spend money to buy tickets. Why spend money when I can just open a book?",
        "You should be able to get more than one ticket every hour instead of only 1 until you use it. Really dumb and wastes my time. I'd be on it more if more tickets were available"

        "This game activitly makes me angry. I want to keep playing it but the longer I play the less accurate my ship becomes, eventually missing EVERY SHOT, EVERY TIME. It feels likes the longer you play the game the less effect your ship becomes. It's a fun game but seems like a pretty intense cash grab.",
        "Decent, not good. Enemy flags might as well not exist as they don't fight eachother. You'll end up getting swarmed by every ship that always go faster than you, no matter how much you upgrade speed. They ram You constantly dealing damage but then take no damage from when you ram them. They also aren't affected by friendly fire. You can't actually aim and the constant ads are very annoying.",
        "Easy to play game. Good graphics. Controls can be a bit fiddly, but not that hard to deal with. If playing solidly for a while (30+ minutes), the cannon firing timing stops working properly and all shots miss (except for the enemies!) - restart the game and problem resolves, but a frustrating little bug.",
        "This game is amazing. Hands down one of the best games I've ever played on mobile. Also, you don't need to spend any money! I got to a fully maxed out ships without spending a cent. One thing you guys should add is multiplayer and different style ships, maybe Viking or something. Otherwise great game.",
        "DON'T BELIEVE THE REVIEWS AND THE RATINGS. They are artificially inflated. The game itself is okay, but nothing special or super fun. 1 star because of the false rating otherwise a solid 3 (simple and uninvolving arcade ship shooter)"

        "Amazing game very addictive...  Love the fact that they have a specials  more often... Also like the events with the second hospitals... Would like if we had special events more often... Just wish we had a platform to save the game my sister had to restart the game 6 times i had to do it twice... Wou be great to save progress on fb or another platform... Even log in  Really frustrating when we lose progress.... I only need 5 more characters then I'll have them all... So if i lose progress again im not starting over  Overall my favorite game on my phone!! Thx",
        "I couldn't get enough patients, I couldn't get enough cash, and my staff energy seemed to drain way too fast. I love the surgery games but you maybe get one of those a day. I ended up uninstalling when room upgrades said they would take 12 hours. Too much waiting, not enough action. I liked the story so far too. Maybe I'll reinstall in the future if the times go down.",
        "It's a great game at first, but it takes so long to upgrade or save money or anything that you end up spending a lot of your real life money. Plus the surgeries all start to be the exact same, and the glitches... oh, the glitches. Zapped $200,000 out of my bank, and that bloody epinephrine shot is impossible to get without striking out. Oh, and $120,000 for research that will only make you $4,000? Why is everything so time and resource consuming???",
        "Controls don't work properly during surgery! There is lot of lag while performing an action while the timer works properly. Moreover, it doesn't allow me to suture the skin, even if I'm trying to do it right (it worked at the begining). Please fix these bugs or I will uninstal the game...",
        "Love the overall feel of this, though some things need tweeking. For example, I only have half of the staff available and am now getting far too many duplicate cards concidering how many I have left to get. Makes it feel all too much like it's pushing people to spend real money, something that always ends with me deleting the game and moving on. Hope this doesn't happen in this case, but I'm not holding my breath...",
        "It's a nice game, I like the concept, you get to operate on patients and manage a hospital. Problem with the recruitment part, it was always giving me surgeons and wasted 200 hearts on the same person. There should be an option if you want to fire someone or replace with another staff. The biggest issue is with their connectivity, internet connection is very stable works with all apps except for this one, no idea why. Fix it please I would hate to delete this game. Thanks."

        "Love this game. Second time I've played it. At level 46 I unlocked the whistles, at level 90 I finished the first puzzle, at level 95, I got my first carousel, at level 100 I had unlocked everything except the puppies...still need red puppy, at level 101 I got my first ferris wheel, at level 105 I got the first swinging ride, at level 121 I unlocked tier 7 & at lvl 130 I finished 2nd puzzle. Only thing I hate is the adds popping up as I touch the board, so it goes to the game & I have to exit. Edit: third time playing. March 2018. So much has changed!!! Quests, boxes, keys & now my game is saved...had to start from scratch but wont lose it again!!!",
        "It's is nearly impossible to play because of the amount of pop-ups. In one minute, I counted 15 pop-ups. Even if you aren't touching the screen, whilst waiting on coins, it jumps from advertisement to advertisement. A decent game ruined by pop-ups.",
        "It has its moments. With the abundance of ads present and the fact that the game gives notifications for things you cant get and the forced instructions at times it is a okay game but pretty boring after a while.",
        "Extreme amount of ad pop ups. Usually loses dollars and coins. Fun but with all the flaws its not worth it. I played so far and it started over out of nowhere. Can't load or anything. Waste of my time",
        "I really enjoy this game..I  originally began playing to earn credits for another game but drifted past level 7,which was the required level I intended to complete and stop playing. Next thing I knew I was clicking away, determined to get the next cute \"prize,\" down the centre aisle. I looked up to see I was at level 10! Geez! I knew I was hooked when I found myself looking at my coin balance..found it satisfactory...smiling...i forgot my original game...now that's an addictive game!! Lol! I blame the cute puppy dog prize that lured me with its overwhelming cuteness..",
        "I've run 2 other apps to get bonus coins both at almost 1k each and I never got my coins. I finished the tutorial like it said I had to but zero coins were given for it. U shouldn't offer free coins to run other apps if u aren't going to give the coins for it. Will probably give up and delete bc of it.  Tried to give it a 2nd chance and did the flash light purchase to get 2268 coins and never got my coins. Why offer free coins if u won't give the free coins?  I emailed like recommend and sent proof like requested and still nothing. I smell a lawsuit for false advertisement. My $4.99 spend on a flashlight is going to make me thousands. Thanks for not doing ur job."

Whenever I try to watch an ad, the game crashes and the random pop up ads have like a 20% chance to crash the game.",

Like it is now it's very hard to manouvre around incoming cops as you only have a split second to react. Maybe something like a copcar indicator would be in place as well.  For the rest I find the game great and super fun to play, although I'd hope to see newer, cooler and more expensive cars. The ones that are available right now are quite easy to get and don't need much grinding at all.  All with all it's a great game and I love playing it. Keep on the good work folks!",

        "My favorite puzzle/physics app. After I reached my goal of 3 stars on all the levels, I was sad my conquest was over. Then I discovered a whole other area of the app that consists of user created levels to solve. Now I've got new puzzles everyday thanks to the active fans in the brain-it-on community and I submit my own levels on occasion by using the level editor. If you like solving puzzles this is a great way to escape for awhile and exercise your brain at the same time.",
        "I introduced this game to my 8 year old and my husband. We are all hooked! I am fascinated by the concept and simple yet brilliant design. The forced 30 second ads that another reviewer mentioned are only if you want a hint. The between-round ads are short and intermittent.",
        "this game is so simple but yet so challenging. some levels seem impossible but the great thing is you can still advance as long as you have enough points. very well done. hats off to the designer. the physics are coded perfect as well for gravity friction inertia and sometimes extra bounce..  love it. can only handle it in bursts of play because it works your brain so intensely. havent used the hints either though. if you dont keep coming back to play this then you probably arent a very interesting person and spend too much time diddling your privates",
        "I'm surprised this game scores so well. It's an exercise in drawing/scribbling, not physics. The puzzles are very one dimensional and most of them are solved by trial and error over thought and skill. It's a novel idea but given what else is available out there I wouldn't pay a penny for this game as it lacks innovation, originality and just feels very dated.",
        "LOVE this game!! Literally, I don't think I can explain it. Just play it, and see for yourself :D    If you like figuring stuff & puzzles out, this is totally for you! And also, it's just so satisfying to watch. I personally play lots of the puzzles over & over again, just to see the graphics, how all the objects fly and move 😜",
        "A good sign of high intelligence would be to not pay for this.   On a tablet with a pen,  this probably works a little better but on a phone with 1 minute ads,   it's really frustrating.   Basically,  you find a solution and have to repeat it 30 times until the dull and unrealistic physics of this program finally accept it."

        "I really enjoy this game, and unlike similar games, bonus coins are given generously, so it isn't too difficult to move to the next stage. A slight irritation is that many words are specific to the American language, and there are some I've never heard of (and I'm over 60!). For me though, this doesn't spoil the game. The best of its type I've tried.",
        "The game is Good and a good way to test your skills, Although it contains to many adds. Another good thing is that the game gives you free coins everyday and you can use it to help you out just in case you do not know the answer very well. What I dislike about the game aside from too much adds, It is an expensice price to pay if either you want to Reveal a letter, Tell the 1st and 2nd pic or skip the question. If possible, please make the amount lower😇 THANKS",
        "It's a good game but having an add after every puzzle is a bit much. Yake a bit too much time and easyy to lose interest. Maybe every 5 puzzles wo ups be better I know y'all gotta make your money but the constant ads make me want to uninstall.",
        "Now that I've played it awhile its an alright game. You definitely should give more points for solving since they're pretty good puzzles. Only getting 2 pts for each solve makes you not really wanna play. Not enough reward for the work. Especially when it costs so much for hints.",
        "Since no one reads 5 star reviews I figured I would rate as 1. Great time killer during those boring meetings or occasional bouts of constipation. Want to take a break from your mind numbing job? This is equally mind numbing....but hey, play on your bosses time. When you see a picture you can't figure out, lower your mental ability to where it makes an amoeba seem like Einstein......from there you will get every puzzle. Enjoy",
        "Great game. You should definitely earn at least 5 coins by default  when you solve a puzzle instead of 2 and more when watching an ad. The game seems Americanised (I'm British)  and  I didn't recognise some of the words (webmail?). Very fun though!"

Since I discovered the problem I have been REPEATEDLY trying to get in touch with your customer service. You are still continuing to charge me every few minutes.  Please stop.  Please refund me and please contact me.",

        "This game is actually really fun, but two stars for the ads. They're not well-distributed, having reached a point where no ads would show up after a few runs, and then one would appear after every run no matter how short. A 30 second ad after a run that ended in just a couple seconds? Multiple times in a row? I understand ads needs to be there, but I'd like to have more play time than ad time.",
        "The game itself is pretty fun. I think I'd like it. But the ads are far, far too intrusive. Not only are there too many. But, many of them have timers. Some are 30 seconds, and you can't break out. Too annoying. I have no interest I sitting and waiting for ads to finish",
        "Very enjoyable game, quite addictive and jumping back into a new game is quick. Couple of gripes, there seems to be some slow down or framrate dipping after an ad has shown and the option to remove ads isn't working. Sort this out and it will get another 2 stars",
        "Wow!!!! I've never been more annoyed with an app in my life!!! I would play this game all day long but the amount of ads are literally driving me insane! Two runs and another 15 second ad comes up. No thanks",
        "Ads pop up during gameplay where your fingers contact so it stops game play ... other than that it's good but I've had enough. Fk you chilly:-p uninstalling",
        "This game was my favorite of any maybe ever. I played all the time, then there was an update and I had to uninstall. It made the app close constantly (even when it wasn't even open and I was in other apps), there's way too many ads that make me want to vomit, and it stats to lag now when it never did before. Someone at corporate ruined this game. Smh."

        "The makers of this game have put their soul into it, bringing into life every element of the game. The characters are charming and beguiling. I'm in love with princess. 😁 It's the only game where I've invested real cash, and have received  its full worth. The game is an epic. I love it. Cons: Although I've purchased gems, and bought legendary chests, I've only received relatively less efficient cards like lava hound and graveyard which help in game play only if complemented with other cards. It's a bummer. I think they want me to spend more to enjoy more desirable cards.",
        "I don't think I need to 'review' much here. There are some points I definitely don't like about the game. Such as the matchmaking... You get matched with the same deck type in a row. Other than that and some minor flaws it's a great game. I love the competitive aspect about it.  Finally I would suggest some 2v2 with different game modes, such as ramp up 2v2. Also, add the rematch button in 2v2 challenges with random mates.  Hope I hit the 4,3k this season. Good luck to all clashers!",
        "I think Clash Royale is a great game to play and is very well put together for all ages, it is a fast paced game and at the same time can be played with an individual pace of your own to a degree being that there is a clock ticking, also new characters are released at a well balanced rate, so that the game doesn't become boring and the regular balance of the characters strengths and weaknesses are balanced to make the game more competitive. I recommend this game for all ages and abilities. It's great for a few minutes or an hour or so and this game also has several different tournaments you can enjoy yourself or with a friend or a teammate. See you soon on Clash Royale. A.K.A. Dad.",
        "Supercell, I think your best game is hay day. Clash royale on the other hand isn't one of your better games. Android is better than apple. Why would you ever support apple instead of android. You released Brawl Stars only for apple. You should have less medieval/fantasy games unless you make the knights, princes etc. More realistic. In my opinion I think you're better at making farm and army games. Please make more of those😖",
        "This is the only game of its kind. Many companies try to copy, but this is the original and the best. There are  endless possibilities of card combos and decks that you could use making the game always entertaining. My only complaint is that the trainer is way too easy to beat. It is one of few games that you could get competitive without using your own 💰. I also like how the stuff that u unlock in the beginning does not go to waste later in the game.",
        "What do we do?  I have been playing this game from 9 months now. In these 9 months i got 3 Legendary Cards 2 from chest and 1 from Clan Chest. But the thing is that all of them were Ice Wizard. I'm in Arena 9 from 2 months now Because i dont have the cards to win. I check the tv royale every time i open the Game for a good deck But. So Supercell tell me what do i do? I can't push to Hog Mountain then what do i do in this game? Please do something"

        "I loved it so much😍😍",
        "Well this is a surprise. It does not have much story yet but a good read if you've every played pixel berry's \"choices\" game. Same concept which means choices are going to need diamonds. Meaning you need to pay to do them. I really find it a nice read but since the books are few i'm on hold on purchasing diamonds. I guess once a series is completed i'm willing to buy diamonds to replay that game. For now i'm just browsing the game and taking notes on how many diamonds are going to cost per book.",
        "This game is amazing! The graphic is pretty great, plus the story is super ADDICTIVE. I can't stop reading this story but because of I have no pass left. However the problem is the pass, the pass is too little and the time is pretty long to wait. I hope this app would give much pass and please make the time shorter. But still this game is awesome, I recommend this game for you. You should download this app and try it.",
        "Love story games but it requires me to pay so much. It would have been decent if i spend only $3 or less for a game but pay almost $10 to play it especially if you want the characters to grow into liking each other. Its way too expensive. Need to reassess and sell the passes n diamonds cheaper! Otherwise it would have been a nice game. Its too much money.. cos they only let you play first 1 to 3 or so episodes for free n the remaining ones need passes n diamond which cost money. At some situation some diamonds requested are way too much...",
        "Great game! Awesome and enjoyable storyline, alongside with great characters! My favorite series is for sure the Campus Hacker books! Definitely recommend this app. Ads come up every so often, and you don't get very many passes, but other than that it's awesome!"

        "Was pretty good, liked the levels and the graphics were cool. The combonation of the colours on the black and white were quite nice. The only problem i had was when it came to the controls. Its a bit hard to naviagte back and forth. It can be easy to make a turn you didnt really want to do but harder to correct it cause it does not stop until it is too late or very far down the path. It would be great if you were able to stop mid run. But other than that I enjoyed playing this game.",
        "If you like doing mazes, then I highly recommend this game. It's by far the best maze game app I've come across! Not only is it addicting, but it is fun and more challenging/authentic then any other maze games I've tried. There are plenty of levels/modes to keep you entertained. It's the only maze puzzle app I've found worth playing! 😀💜",
        "Sublime controls, varying but very original and fun game modes, and an online leaderboard for the ones interested..!  I'd easily rate this 5 stars if the white-on-grey theme didn't give me a headache! For the love of whatever God is out there, at least give the choice between a light and dark theme, PLEASE?!",
        "I'm not far into it, but it's fun so far. My eyesight could be why it's not a 5-star experience. The more complex levels are very small and give me a headache after a couple of mazes. I believe the contrast and color schemes could be improved and make the game better. It's still a very good game though.",
        "I love mazes and this game keeps me on my toes. Even though I haven't played it too long, an adult ad popped up that I felt was inappropriate. This concerns me because my 7yo daughter is also fond of mazes. Now I'll have to download a separate kid version for her.",
        "5 stars, the game does exactly what it should do, and the controls are simple and intuitive, but please, can you add a feature to prevent the screen from turning off? It messes a little when I try to mentally solve the classic mazes"

        "I liked the game so much. No! I love it, but it's just that I'm now on level 65 but I'm stucked since I only have few gems left and I needed to extend the time, and buy some customers which I find amazing just to save your energy and the stage but I also find it hard since I have already completed 3 stars from lower levels and why is it that I can't play the levels I have already completed? I would really suggest that lower levels would still be played just to be able to collect gems. I hope you can fix this issue though. I'm so loving this game and I'm getting addicted to it. I got stucked on level 65 on my two days of playing. Thank you",
        "I love this game! So few games actually suck me in, but this game had me addicted right away. I play on my phone and laptop. Yes I have two different games at different levels lol. I love how upgrades are so easy and it isn't impossible to upgrade or move on. It gets challenging as you go up levels but it's so fun.",
        "Moving on is hard on some levels because they are specifically designed for you to use gems and they are hard to come by. However, If you are patient enough you can eventually earn them. I enjoy that you don't have to drag the items to the customers. It's definitely an enjoyable and challenging game. I'm currently at a \"coming soon\" stage where I can no longer move ahead. I've been waiting a long time and do not want to wait forever. Please do an update soon!!!",
        "Great game but some levels really hard I cant pasd this one level im on for days maybe update make it easier pass level I'm on I just did update...I hope so... love game anyways great game to.. identical cooking joy to map was a great game to but also hard get passed certain levels that game to n I can try play fast with my hands to still cant pass to not playing  cooking joy anymore going stick with this one see if game gets easier to",
        "It's fun till you run out of energy. They get you too rate the game right away while you are having fun with free lives. Give you enough lives to rate it good then the lives end and you have to watch a min advert or 30 mins for one life Regen. OR PAY. They just want your money at that point. So sad.",
        "Brilliant little time waster of a game.. yet.. once you start getting to the higher levels.. the less chance of earning gems and i aint noway paying for them.. last time I stupidly paid for gems on cooking fever..and got my account hacked into! Big lesson learnt! I do still play this alot tho so overall, definitely a good game. 👍"

Above that it repeatedly cannot find internet connection, be it WiFi or DataPack.  GIVING 3STAR, for good old game. If no fix found, will keep downgrading.  AS EARLIER SAID, ENOUGH OF NUISANCE, DOWNGRADING TO 1STAR. GAME KEEPS HANGING, ADS KEEP INCREASING, WHAT A MESS TO SUCH A ONCE BEAUTIFUL GAME.",
        "The app has glitches during the game and it freezes for long periods of time. Everytime i buy a powerup to use the game freezes i have to always restart the app and my coins are still taken. Also i cant play a level in the mighty league because it wont load when touching it.",

Why don't you read these reviews and fix this issue.  I have you but you keep asking for the same information.",

        "It's good. A decent game that forces you to grind and wait, OR you could spend money to buy gold to open more chests. I would have given it 4 stars if it weren't for the fact that to watch ads to get rewards, I have to give it my LOCATION, ALLOW IT TO MANAGE MY CALLS, and access to my media. Why do you even need my location and phone number to watch an ad for rewards?",
        "Love this time killer. Its a simple game, simple concept. Easy to learn the controls by yourself, and unlock stuff. Simplistic graphics, and will most likely run smooth in any device. Now, the only issue here is, that unlocking a chest is a tad bit too expensive, and gaining coins and stars are a bit hard. Tho, i havent unlocked quests yet, so i dont know. Either way, Awesome game, cant wait for future updates, and i really hope the devs will add new worlds, characters, weapons and customisations maybe?",
        "I love this game in every way. It's a great time killer and it's fun to collect the helmets. The chests don't wait too long to open and the challenges keep you from just messing around. My only complaint is the lack of creativity in the weapons. If I work hard enough to get a new helmet I would like to see at least one unique weapon per helmet. Instead it is a different combination of the regular weapons.",
        "As a 3D MMORPG dev it is hard to find something that is enjoyable on this damned store. However your combination of simplicity mixed with a variety of prefabs and abilitys alongside particles and everything else make this an excellent game. You dont spam ads, you don't make it incredibly difficult and you don't make it pay to win.  A tip of my hat to you guys. I would give this 5 stars if I didn't have a buck fifty skins in my face all the time....",
        "Great game......the only problem in this game is that the lack of information about a weapons..... i wish their are something like a short tutorial about the types of weapons or a short video on what happen if the weapon equiped..... since the game is just currently launch... its normal that it has minor bugs.... but please fix it as soon as the updates come....for a summary: A reallly great game and entertaining",
        "I enjoy the gameplay and various unlock/progression mechanics, but the game is extremely laggy. It may be my device, however. Also, some hitboxes seem to be mercilessly accurate and it can be very frustrating. That may not be something to change, but definitely something to note."

But other then that its pretty cool! I've just started so I've notgonna do a whole lot yet. Went to a yellow area once but man so not ready for that.. Also seems like I can't never keep stuff to heal me or even find it? Keep up the good work!!",
        "Great game, restrictive on recipes, needs to improve learning them better. Durability can improve with repair proficiency. Lower proficiency lower durability,  houses could have durability consistent to material. Stronger longer lasting. Anything and everything on enemies gatherable would be awesome, i.e clothes off walkers armor off knights. Environment growth above dungeons could be progressable. Never completed dungeon no growth completed many times a knight.  Fishing would be nice. Hire vendor would be great in player compound. Upgradable structures is cool. Learning them.",
        "I love this game, very addictive and fun. Few things i would like to see change. When you die you can not always find your body to retrieve your things or get to them due to monster. I uninstalled the sister game because if thia as it become impossible to progress when you loose all your best stuff. Also should include the add option to make energy easy to get.",
        "this game is very cool but seriously you really have to spend money to enjoy it fully.The energy system is garbage and walking from place to place is tooo long... seriously 24 MINUTES,also inventory space is insanely limited and it wants you to spend money for more slots. I understand you have to do this in a free game but please don't make the game unplayable becouse of that. I still hope this game will be better in the future becouse i enjoy my time playing it",
        "I am picky. This game grabbed me and hasn't let go! I willingly bought in-app on day three, and I LOATHE micro transactions with the white hot intensity of a thousand suns.  The ethos of the game is perfect, dark, eery, and forboading.   Love the crafting and foraging. Love the RISK inherent in death. Eau to play, hard to master. Perfect.  The only improvement I can see is to have the world be larger, the storyline more full, and add character modification. In effect, just make more of what is already amazing.",
        "I love it! It's a wonderful game,  well made and had beautiful traffics graphics but, the energy recharge is slow,  which makes playing the game longer than 10 minutes impossible. Plants should grow back as well as trees after a certain time. I also made two purchases and never received them. I bought talons and a weapons cache. Please give me my weapons or my $8.99 back."

        "It needs an option to turn the sound off independently. I don't want to have to constantly turn my media volume level up and down every time I begin or end playing the game. Sometimes two ads in a row before you can get back to the game. Otherwise it is a satisfying games to play.",
        "I really like it. Has your mind thinking. I like the fact that after awhile if you don't get the word it helps you out without having to use the hint option. Even my 9 year old likes it.. he plays it with me sometimes",
        "Great game to pass the time away. My only gripe is the daily challenges, the timings don't really work for me so I often miss the morning ones. Would be better if it went midnight to mid-day and then mid-day to midnight.",
        "It's not very challenging like some of the other word games I've played. I was at level 50 in a matter of mins. To me anyway thats way too easy. My 4 yr old granddaughter could probably play this game with ease",
        "Good game. Does have alot of adverts u can claim coins so far on level i am at. Played b4 a while ago and i could only claim 4 times coins for over 24 hours. Maybe once u get to certain level u can only purchase coins. But generally good game. Still  good game thank you.",
        "My sister introduced me to this game and I am addicted!!!!!!. I find it challenging And like that they will give you a hint so that you can clear that level and be able to move on. Thanks for the mind challenge"

        "Game is fun until you get so far and can no longer upgrade to compete.  I have all stars in amateur league, yet on achievement rewards it shows I only have 1 star.  This is a problem to try to earn stars to purchase higher end cars, you can't without spending money.  Should be anle to earn all cars if you play regularly withput spending money.",
        "First up the images used as what the game looks like are fakes. I saw too many polygons.... (Shudder) Secondly there is no start menu. NOPE! Just some fancy loading screen and boom you're in the game without a chance to look at the controls. Plus your first mission is ruined by the tutorial at the worst places on the track.   Bad game knockoff. If you download this just delete it. This game is [EXPLICATIVE]",
        "Nice game at first, my gf got angry at some point because I played it the whole time. However, I soon started playing less and less, because winning just became impossible. I respect the developers, but I wont pay to max out a cars modifications just to race that same car which is twice as fast. How does that work? Are the AI cars getting modifications from a different game?",
        "Update: so I've been playing for several weeks now. You cannot win with maxed out mods, racing the same level cars. They're twice as fast and you can only knock off 3 cars at the beginning of the race and you're unable to catch with others. Even if you spend money, you will not get 1st place in a lot of the races. Very unbalanced game. Whoever programmed the ai should be fired  Fun game, but the intrusive ads are ridiculous. It pops up in the middle of a race, before and after the race, finished off by asking you to pay to remove ads.",
        "The controls is very floaty like your car is late responding when tilted and i really like that this game is very fun and time wasting but it lacks car selection very small but i know it will add soon. And i thought the pic is real but it is not even the same on the game for its originality that all thanks",
        "People have low requirements nowadays. This game doesn't deserve a 4.4 rating. It feels good as long as I stay in the menu (even with the weird japanese mascot) but once the game loads it gets horrible. The camera angles are terrible, the cars feel like toys in the overscaled world, the car's softshadow is terribly aligned and the physics simulation is just mediocre. The whole game is just a mediocre clone of Asphalt 8, I don't understand why people choose an inferior copy instead of the original one..."

        "Amazing game, great time-killer. I discovered a game breaker: if you go into the settings after you die, the number of coins you got in that level, [the number in the brackets] becomes equal to the total number of coins. Keep going back and forth into the settings, and the game will eventually ask if you want to triple the coins by watching a video. Instead of tripling the number of coins you got in that level, the number of total coins you have gets tripled.  Instantly triple your wallet every run.  I want the devs to see this and see if they can patch it because I really like this game and I want the coins I earn to be legit.  Thanks for your time, Mike C.",
        "It has a progression system, but it's completely worthless. The only reason to try to win belts is to get weapons that serve no purpose. You can win most of them by paying 200 coins and getting a random one, but you can, for some odd reason, get duplicates. Not to mention the fact that coin combos actually do nothing, not even useless cosmetic items, nothing. I think adding function to the weapons (e.g. Making long swords slightly longer range or making small weapons quicker) could add more depth and more of a reason to play the game. Overall: It's a good timekiller.",
        "Great game. Best for killing time. Great concept. Need to add a  counter for counting the number of people killed, otherwise awesome. Also there is not much incentive to play to win belts. Make playing with boss again free. Add new opponents (not bosses but the minions) . Make the game a little less challenging. Also remove the brief stun completely",
        "Really fun game. Nice graphics and simple controls. More depth to combat system would be nice. There is no point in achieving coin combos. It does not affect the amount of coins won. Add a multiplier for coin combos, as well as a score multiplier for chaining combos together without missing enemies or coins. Don't allow duplicate items to be won. Very annoying to grind and grind for coins, only to get a duplicate you can't do anything with. Lastly, an option to pay to disable ads would be nice.",
        "The game gives you an unskippable mission to get kills with a certain type of weapon and then will never give you that weapon. I've opened over 100 chests and never got a two handed sword, so my options are pay real money for the the weapon (what they want) or delete this cancer app. I get you have to make money but there are better ways than stopping all progression and ruining the fun. Overall good game 6.7/10",
        "Fun button slasher. Ultimately stopped playing because I got a weapon mission and three random drops buying weapons with in game currency were taking too long to get a weapon of the right type... They want you to pay for them: lame.  Game is a bit unforgiving, especially when you get to boss fights. Once you fail a boss once it becomes much harder to get back which is a strange and annoying design choice."

        "The game is simply awesome in a word. The mesmerizing music combined with excellent commentary makes me nostalgic to the time when FT first released Score World Goals. Playing the game is a very smooth experience, in addition to the pleasure from the quality of the graphics. There are some minor problems in gameplay, but these don't matter that much as the game excels with the idea, execution and result. And of course, it is a game where losing creates no frustration. Thanks to FT for providing us this masterpiece.",
        "Love the reduced tackling. It feels more like a high pressing Premier league match now and actually gives you a chance to stop the better teams. With the slower tackling, one missed time tackle deep in your opponents half can result in  them getting the ball all the way to your penalty box and scoring. All the while your players just hover around doing nothing. Keep the reduced tackle time!",
        "I do not like the new update where tackling recharge has been reduced. I think what it was on before was a lot better and made the game a lot more strategic as you had to time your tackles perfectly. I think reduced recharge should be something you can win in the boxes or buy with the money or gems. Another good idea could be to give the team that's just scored 20 seconds of quicker tackling on the back of the goal they have just scored. Please put it back to the normal tackling rate! I am addicted 😂😁",
        "Honestly so angry, you go on a small losing streak and end up not being able to play a game due to not having enough nomey, so I spend £10 of in app purchases thinking it will sort me out, lose once and again I can't afford to play. Don't download money snatching pile of tosh",
        "Pathetic gameplay, it has so many issues that haven't been solved with the updates. First the game lags so much, then you cant even string 2 passes together when the opponent team tackles you off the ball. Ths happens in all difficulties. Can't attack, can't defend. Player updates cost too much. Fix all of this in the next update.",
        "The fast rechargeable tackles should be removed.  The game is no fun now. Earlier I had to time my tackle perfectly so that I don't give away second balls. And same with the attack. I tried to get tackled in an area where I can win second ball. But now this fast tackle recharge has just ruined the game."

        "Simply wonderful app!! My daughter's speech is delayed and I introduced this to her at 17months. By 20months, we were hearing her sounding out the letters after it's repeated in the app and she has learnt to choose the correct letter when asked by the app. She couldn't get enough of it! Now we've moved on to shapes and colours that she's working through now at 22months. It's truly amazing. Thank u for no ads. Beautiful graphics. No issues with touch or connecting. Would love British English version tho where 'Z' sounds out as 'Zed.'",
        "I absolutely love this app! My child has learnt so much from this along with all the other apps similar as well. There are no adds which is very much appreciated with a 3 year old that will click on anything. I would recommend to anyone!!",
        "Please check shape matching. My son got little confused between pentagon and hexagon because in app it is telling pentagon shape as hexagon. Might be I am wrong.",
        "Amazing app for toddlers. My 2 girls LOVE it. I like how after they say each letter they sound out the letters. And for the other section where the \"a is for apple\" i think it should be the whole alphabet instead of just a few selection of letters. Because some times the letters repeat.. Like they're learning on just letters j or a.. Etc. Idk if you understand me or not. Oh well just my opinion but THANK YOU Also, for those of you saying it has bugs or its very glitched. CHECK YOUR CONNECTION. most of the time when that happens its because either your phone is sh** or you have bad service. Get on that WI-FI",
        "A great app love the fact that they included games for the parent LOL  I would like a continuous flow though instead of having to press the forward button every time  you're done with one segment",
        "2 year old loves this! She already knew all her letters, I'm so glad that I found this fun way to take her to the next step!!! My only suggestion is that it would be really cool if the praise word for completing a letter started with the same letter. For instance, when they write \"A\" the congratulatory word could be \"Amazing\", \"B\" is \"Bravo\", \"F\" is \"Fantastic\", etc."

        "Do not spend any money on this game. This used to be one of the best slot games until the developers got greedy. Payouts are small and events are nearly impossible. They try to make it all sound good but it's not. They also changed the customer service on here where it's hard to get anyone. You cannot message them on Facebook if you have a problem and if you say anything negative about the game you will be blocked. Hope this review saves some of you some time so you can find a better game!",
        "What the hell kind of question is that?  \"Is it beautiful\".... meaning the game! HOW NOT PERTAINING TO ANY GAMES!  Anyway,  this game is hands down the best Slot game EVER!  Have played slots in and out of casino's for over 20 years and this is the one to play! A huge variety of Casino games,  easy to maneuver and a lot of really nice people.",
        "I used to love this game but something they did changed it. Winning is nearly impossible even if you are a paying customer. I know it is a game of luck but when you purchase 85 silver tickets you should be able to complete puzzles when you only need 1 piece for each of them. Make winning a little easier and people will be happy to spend money.  I think the game is broken. I was just playing in a room on Billionaire with a person who was playing on Huge Casino. I know it's the same developer but I don't think that is supposed to happen. I know the person was playing Huge Casino because it was my husband playing it. May want to look into it.",
        "Customer relations are horrible even non existent. If you spend money you will lose far more than you win, in their eyes you will spend even more. If you send a message they will hide behind a canned \"industry standard\" response. This is not a free standing casino there are no freebies and you can't collect any winnings. Yet they have their games dialed in so you lose in hopes you will spend money. Horrible company.",
        "I just started this account in hopes of recovering my lost one. If it goes smoothly, I am happy with the app to date. The slots don't pay as much as they used to, a little tite , otherwise a fun app. The events they choose for you to play, daily, do steal a lot of chips. If u want to remain in a successful club, you must do them, is the main downfall. I would recommend it to my friends.",
        "This is an interesting game. After I played it for awhile it became very boring. Haven't gotten a big or any good win for the past 70 million. I guess if you buy chips you might win more often. It doesn't give you all the bonuses, and it takes gifts and doesn't give them to the gamers you gave it to. So all in all it's just okay. I've never been able to get anywhere with their support team as they added to my reply. I'd give it a one star but if you buy chips it might be better."

        "I Would Give It Five Stars...but...you should make it customizable for the colors you want to cycle through as you stack higher. THIS GAME IS NOT COLOR BLIND FRIENDLY. Great Idea Though, Nice Hand Eye Coordination Exercise. (I see Black and White, so a monochrome setting would be nice. Other people see colors differently as well) Needs A Color Cycle Customizer, or a set of different options for each type of Color Blind. Thanks in advance",
        "I LOVE THIS GAME This is good game design. It rewards you no matter how high you go with a beautiful little tower. The colors are really satisfying. It keeps me engaged since you can \"regrow\" your blocks. That creates tension too--something to strive for. It's so simple but soothing and really addictive!!",
        "A Great Game For When You're Dumpin'. I decided to install it because I ran out of YouTube videos while droppin' a duce. I really enjoy and will be using it the next time I'm in here as well. The ads are there, but they aren't too bad and there is an option to remove them for a small fee as well (which I plan to do.) My time in the bathroom has flew by because of the game and I'm happy to say that. I don't like to stay too long. Great game!",
        "So,  basically it's a pretty fun app to play when you're bored. It's a great time killer, and is very challenging, but at the same time easy! It's a perfect app! I remember I downloaded this, and then I uninstalled it because I needed other apps on my phone. And now I installed it again, so then I have a fun game to play. I don't really have any games on my phone, so this is the perfect one. The inventors are genius! Five stars!!",
        "Challenging and aesthetically pleasing A well made, minimalist stacking game which takes a long time to master, with nice simple visuals, a satisfying game mechanic and good sound effects. The instant replayability makes for a good competitive game amongst friends. The only reason it doesn't have a 5* is because I feel more could have been added to it, and done with the mechanic.",
        "Good, with a major flaw I've ran into an issue that occurs about 1 out of every 3 rounds, where I'll tap, and the game won't register the trap until well after the position I wanted. For a game based on timing and your ability to stack moving blocks, when you tap is important, and needs to be 100% reliable. I'm on a Nexus 6P, very new phone with excellent hardware. I've closed all background apps, to try and troubleshoot. It's an issue I'd like to see fixed."

        "I really enjoy playing this game. It helps me to relax while I am watching TV, or even using in split mode while watching a video or something. It's a bit different then the way I originally used to play Klondike, but still a great game and easy to get used to quickly! I don't mind the 5 second or so ads between games. It's the price you pay to get a good, free game. It's not like they play constantly and during a game there is usually an ad on the bottom screen but it will quickly move if you go to start a new game or need to access the other options.",
        "It's a fun relaxing game. Its so addictive that every device I have, must have this game. I have it on my phone, ipad and tablet. Except my laptop cuz then I would get no work done. About the ads, one pops out each time you finish a game, so I'm not to bothered by it. Also, theres no videos too watch in order to earn coins or diamonds because none are needed. I just love it. Its stress free.",
        "I would have scored higher except there is suddenly super annoying music being played that there is no option to turn off. The ads also now autoplay loud music. I agree with another poster who said it starting to seem like you lose more so you see more ads. I liked this because it was good for a quick game while getting ready to sleep. The music ruins this. I'm going to try another app now.",
        "I love the game solitaire played it on many different computers over the years. Downloaded three other version on my phone. All of which I deleted almost straight away because they were finicky and I didn't like the format. This one is easy to use and no glitches. So far so good.",
        "Addicting to play. The amount of ads is annoying and gets in the way of some of the controls sometimes, but otherwise it's a nice little game! I also like that it keeps track of stats and that you can deal just one card or 3 cards at a time!",
        "Terrible ads. So bad they hid the menu bar behind an ad banner so you click the ads just to access settings. Pretty sure they recently increased losing deal rate to make more ad videos play. So many other solitaire aps available so skip this one."

It runs well and is fun, so I would highly suggest getting it.   Edit: I see lots of people talking about boring gameplay, and I think they just haven't had a good game. After over 50 games and plenty of wins, this game is always fun to drop in to",

        "I d give it 10/10 if there way a search button to look for mayors, more communication options (private/public) messaging to facilitate talking in the game etc..and concerning the gameplay, it would better if devs reduce the production time of items. It takes way longer and as players we dont have all day to play even if we used boosters and in game cash !",
        "Wonderful game indeed. The only thing is missing is the financing part. Would be really nice to have a banking inductor a stock market where you could trade financial products like other cities bonds or debt. Financing during the game can be a big problem so having a financial hub from where you could trade and borrow would be really useful. Thank you for developing this amazing game.",
        "Too much waiting for things to get made and produced. The storage and items for upgrades FAR too difficult to get. 42 items to raise storage by 5 items. And it can take weeks to find all the items. When you go to global storage and find an item that you really need, by the time that you get there, it's already sold! 😠 Also, it takes 3 different items, and you have 3 of one item and 24 of another. Really? Also, it should be that you get needed items more often, randomly rather than at specific times. Other than that, a good game.",
        "Like the competition challenges it holds your attention. the time frames of production are a little long however the markets move products fast. I also like the club wars and the mayors challenges. My dislike is there are not enough thought bubbles in the fact that you only get two the rewards should be more frequently.",
        "The new arenas for war are terrible... There is a massive lag time... I can't even get to the war after rebuilding until the game thinks for approximately 45 seconds... By the time I actually get one shot off it's a minute and a half... Then I'm almost dead and you come back with I'm sorry we're experiencing connectivity issues get it fixed please!",
        "The Sims keeps progressive challenges fun and interesting, and the Club Wars make for a very fun multiplayer experience!  The graphic attention to detail is amazing! It's quite relax just to watch the shadows of the skyline stretch as the sun crosses the sky or to see hot air balloons floating around the metropolis.  This game is lots of fun!!"

Very good game. Well done.",

Mildly entertaining if you like to feel smart but only a diversion for a matter of minutes. Personally I much rather apps where for a payment you can remove the adds but this isn't one!",

If you could go over that level and maybe go through a couple others/the rest, that would be nice. Great game overall though!",

It's very annoying that when completing a level, the menu starts right at the top and you have to scroll down to the next level, so once you get passed level 20, it's quite irritating.  As others have said it's a very easy game but it is good. Just needs minor improvements.",

The latest video advert lasted inbetween games lasted 8 mins....ridiculous!!!.

No, need to join the T Club (who comes up with this) and pay an ongoing fee. It's TETRIS from the 80s, EA must you milk everything. Nothing is sacred",
        "Great game, but there's an annoying window that pops up everytime I try and start a new marathon. The window is pretty much useless and wastes my time. Would give this 5 stars if it gets patched",
        "Great game and builds on. The original. The only thing stopping it getting the 5* rating is that the ads on it are sometimes several minutes long and at times when they have finished you can't return to the game. I don't mind watching them as I know that's what funds it, but they are putting me off playing now.",

I was told if I came back each day I would get free coins not true, I didn't get 7000 coins when I watched a movie, and when I played  max bet I got the same pay out if I was playing for 500.

The way you have to jump I am not a fan of I wish it was on the other side. Lastly is it would be nice to have doors,so the viligers couldn't get into your house. One more thing is I wish you didn't have all of these assignments to do to get money and diamonds.",

        "Its a relaxing game to enjoy. It is competitive, but not over bearing to where all there is, is competition. I have always been a fan of solitaire games since they were on windows pc computers on dial up if we wanted to play a game its mostly all we had lol when the connections went down. The game is well made and doesn't have that many ads for a free game its nice. Well done",
        "It is a beautiful well balanced game, however too many ads, and unable to turn off sounds on the ads. The algorithm could be a bit harder. I knows it's a money maker for you with no real incentive to offer a paid version. But I would gladly pay $1 to rid the ads.",
        "The ads are a real pita.  You can get rid of the sound by turning your media volume all the way down.    Also even after I uninstalled it I started getting occasional ads.  They must have left some hidden app on my phone.  That's not at all cool.    I love the game play, the hints and the possibility of choosing a game you know can be won.  I wish they'd just offer a paid as free version but I suppose they make more money from advertisers than they'd make by charging.",
        "This game sucks i did try to win one game and i did try all solutions without sucsess.. if the game dosent give you right to win (than this is not a game) some rounds have no solution just to make you losse some points.. idk to explain in english! Can't upload pic of my last round!",
        "These guys are greedy! An ad after every game and they load slowly and some have timers so that you have to wait to delete them. Very greedy buggers. Plus the game is too easy to win. I deleted it",
        "The game play is nice, and the ads are not to intrusive, but i am giving this a one star because of the AUDIBLE ads. The seem to only come o  at night and gets VERY annoying. Especially when my wife or kids are sleeping and then this rediculously loud add pops up and you cant skip it."

        "Ok best game ever. I always dreamed of playing games like pubg or ml something like that but its just not my thing yknow? How its hard to control and super annoying to play. But this god this takes the trophy. Easy control, fun game play, get to live again after dying so no need to be sad so yeah well done gi",
        "Update: Game was fixed very fast and is my favorite game. Everyone should download and play this game. It's simply amazing with great graphics!!! Only thing is why can't we have a woman character? I'm a woman in real life and want to play one online too!!! When are you all going to add women characters???",
        "Graphics are good an Gun play is pretty fair. When battling the game goes on runs where I get matched against teams whos members are way stronger then my team an I. Then it goes back to fair match making.   3 Month UPDATE: The game has turned into a money grab. You have no chance to compete against players that drop a bunch of money an have 4 an 5 star guns. This was the top shooting game in my opinion, but turning it into a pay to compete killed the fun with this game. Havent been match fairly against players in a couple weeks now. I would recommend trying a different p vs p shooting game.",
        "Amazing game, however there is one small problem, but not enough for me to not give it 5 stars. Recently when I've been watching an ad to double the reward at the end of the battle, the video has played until the end and it says the reward has been doubled, but I only receive the regular reward? It has happened 15-20 times and it's getting slightly annoying, as I'm about 4000 gunbucks short of what I should be now. Anyways, thanks for making such an awesome free game with little to no adverts!  UPDATE: video watching for additional rewards does not work with anything. No extra crates or supplies",
        "One of the best fps I've played. Graphics is cartoonish but fun, Remedy is underpowered in the sense that it doesn't generate a decent HP on each hit. On lower levels, it's decent but on higher levels against Porcupine, Ranger, Thunder it doesn't stand a chance that could be balanced out by either increasing the rate of fire or increased health generation on each hit , Lifestealer is pretty darn awesome but could do better with a bit smaller crosshair and little bit more accuracy",
        "Initially the game seems super addictive but once you hit level 16 it gets ridiculous. You have players who have spent money on guns and you're practically no match. Also the teaming of players should be balanced out. Another thing is even if you win a match you win around 30 trophies, if you lose there's a loss of 60 and if by chance you're internet is bad and you automatically get kicked out and cannot reenter you lose a 100 .Eventually you get sick and tired of all this and the game gets boring."

First adds would take forever to play then they wouldn't play at all and it would freeze up till you closed it out then my whole phone froze up has NEVER happend before. I UNINSTALLED this game and my phone is back to normal. Not worth screwing up your phone. It's a bit fun but there are other games out there.",
        "Game is fun, but it crashed (Samsung Galaxy S7) and lost all progress. Now had to start again (which is not such a big problem), but then the game glitches and I don't get anything for leveling. Meaning I can't get past car level 4 anymore, because there are simply not enough parking spaces. Will give 5 stars if this gets fixed.",
        "Just a typical merger. I agree the ads are a bit excessive and when you watch ads that actually help you the doubler only lasts 2 1/2 minutes. I like these kind of games though. And now it's take me to spam pop ups. Ugh. Gave it  another try anf This one still has potential...but for now it's getting deleted again.",
        "Too many adds. You keep getting random adds in addition of the adds you are clicking yourself in order to progress. There are many games that following the same policy but getting random adds without a reward while I'm opening just a menu is really annoying",

        "Nice game with very good events but the drop rates to heroes of 5 star is too low i killed a lot of gems and scrols and hero orbs and my first 5 star i  dropped it at lvl 75. Okok now again event of summoning 100 scrolls and i continue still no 5 star hero only 4, just try and fix the drop rate. In the rest its a nice game.",
        "Too much pay to win, free players hardly getting anywhere in the events and so fourth, not fair, increase the rewards of spending money and give free players more too easily solved, I previously rated it 5 stars instantly loved it but as I've progressed it's just not fair!! Please do something!! I am vip6 but I'm not rich, please bring more rewards for loyal free users who watch the ads and everything!! Thank you!!",
        "I purchased the spring festival card on top of all the money I've already dumped into this game and the devs didn't give me my in game rewards. I've submitted numerous tickets to get a refund or my rewards and they just reply there is no problem. Ya no problem with you taking my money.  They deleted my review, wonder how many other people had this issue and had reviews deleted.",
        "Wasn't sure about this game at first. I love it. I use a f2p  and a vip one  to see  the difference  between the two. Really well done. Having said all that the game does require patience. This is an IDLE game. You pick it up do dailies, talk, spend money, or what ever you want to do in game, then put it down to \"farm gold,xp,mats\". The high end heros do take some planning to aquire as a f2p player. This game requires patience because it's an IDLE game. Yes some people have a ton of money to throw at the game but don't be jealous, just play your game and have fun.",
        "There is certainly alot to do, but is there really much to DO do? I've just been continually tapping red dots and getting free prizes, which (although nice) doesn't feel like I'm especially earning anything, you know?  Feels like a game that will keep you occupied for maybe months, but a year after you delete it will you really REMEMBER it? Probably not.",
        "Not what I expected, given that my first impression of it was of IH being an \"annoying add\". Once I decided to pick it up though my thoughts changed rather drastically.   It's simple, it's fun and the warm colour palette of the graphics make a nice change compared to the widespread use of bleak colours in other games.   If you think you might enjoy this game, you sure are my friend."

        "Ive been playing for a year an some change an my characters the 4 star champions only hav 20 of them an as i progress it gets intense but the game itself cuts back on rewsrds especially the daily grind for 4 star crystal shards. ALSO worth mentioning that a year of playing an i cannot reach max rank on 4 star. Dont mention the 5 star champions. It will take you prob 4 to 5 months of everyday grinding to fully rank a 5 star or even obtain a new one. All the steam aside.  A great game addicting to the  higher levels as you progress",
        "The game is okay, but the drop rates are so suckish. I have opened 10 premium hero crystals  but have not even got a 3 star. My friend, opened his 2nd premium crystal and got a 3 star! Kabam pls like cancel out 2 star heroes in premium hero crystals and like only 3 to 4 or 5 star heroes inside. Oh and u can like gurantee  a 3 star in the 1st premium hero crystal, and also not force people to buy the 2 star hero crystal.",
        "The game is very uncreative. Many of the characters have same moves even when they have different powers... I advice to increase some moves of the players which should be according to their powers otherwise good game.  And also the drop rate is bad, upto this point I have opened about 60 premium crystals and haven't got a single 3 star hero or higher.  .",
        "Pretty repetitive. swipe back, swipe forward, tap tap tap, hold, repeat. controls are rather monotone which I'll slighlty overlook because of the nature of the game but I see a lot of champions have the exact same moveset. also the drop rates are pretty bad. And on arenas, the opponents bcome a lot more powerful than my own. Other than that, good time killer",

If I really did anything wrong then they have to send me the proof. with out any proof and information they blocked me. You guys blocked me fine now send me the proof.

More lessons would be nice as compleated all of them already more cars and possibly a bike would not go a miss. Like the free ride option allot Barry minor glitches to sort out but other than than that keep it up excellent game well done. But please sort out little problems. Thanks.",
        "I like the game but when you are driving in the slopes/hills it's really hard to turn and then you have too watch a ad to undo it.At Every time you turn on the hill you go on the other side and get points taken off you for crossing the line so could you improve the game by NOT taking points off when you turn on a hill and can it PLEASE not be constanly raining because you the driver in the game have too keep on turning the wipers on and off. (Also sorry for long review and i wasn't shouting just making the point clearer)",
        "Im having troubles with the canada map i go straight when it says straight and it says i had an error of blinker usage or ill turn with the blinker on and it says error as well so im confused another thing is i wish the camera wasnt so easy to move. One more thing is in real life i know i should put on a blinker when changing lanes but i cant tell if your game does that or not sorry for tge long review i hope it helps tho",
        "It has very good graphics, controls, and it's a very addicting game. On of the best driving games I have played. But there is a problem with the Canada map. Cuz I see cars go straight through red lights and when I turn it says that I didn't use the correct blinker when I know I did. But other than that I think it's a great game. I hope they can fix the Canada map for me.",
        "It doesnt work. Tries to load I see a car and a stop sign I see it loads me google account then it just closes the app kicking me back to home screen. I have a samsung galaxy s3 yeah its old however I do play gta san andreas on it I should be able to play this.",
        "The game would get a much higher rating if it didnt penalize after each stoplight. It wants you to turn your blinker on at each light regardless if you switch lanes."

The controls are great and graphics a+. (they also keep adding new fun stuff that makes the game fun to play for even experienced players) great game 😀",

If when starting the game you don't see the \"Restore\" button, quit immediately and start again after few hours when (and if) the restore button appears again. If you can't restore your progress and continue playing without restoring, then all your progress is lost!",

Who the hell cares about a dog when you can't even keep a jacket for more than a trip to a location... Update has lost my account again and do you know... I think that I have had enough. I'll come back if you do ever finally release it which I don't think you will until you stop wasting time on pointless additions and concentrate on the core gameplay.sort yourselves out, I am going to find another game.",
        "for anybody just starting out don't bother to download and play this game. I've been playing pretty much from the first version and have yet to find a fuel tank for my motorcycle. the developers either just don't listen to the people playing the game and address the problems people have with the game or don't care. with every update it's becoming more and more obvious they're more concerned with how to get more money out of players that are willing to spend it.",
        "Dog update just lost all my data including motorcycle, nearly finished acid bath, and atv, cement base with maxed out trunks, loads of stuff. Played every day for months to have it all wiped away in 1 update. They have done this repeatedly to others and yes it was connected to playstore. I have restored it before. This time it doesnt connect!",
        "What the hell i got raided and when i went to get a revenge raid i was not able load into his base. Then i restarted the game and all my stuff was gone that i had taken to raid my 6 iron hatchets, fully moded ak, fully moded glock and all of my tactical armour"

The fact that's it Tekken makes it more enjoyable than average because I love Tekken, but that's just me. I feel that acquiring new characters needs to be way easier than it is, especially when you need to take on harder missions for bonus materials and currency. I don't like how you have to wait for characters health to regenerate. If characters healths auto filled per mission, I would definitely put more time into the game. Since it isn't, I have to constantly stop playing and wait for the health to refill, and I don't wait to use healing items because it takes away from my in game currency, which itself is difficult to obtain if you aren't constantly grinding. Aside from that, it's fun. Very fun, I recommend.",
        "WOW, great memories came back. Amazing graphics, and story is going good so far. Only thing is the controles, I mean you should have given the original TEKKEN controls with the moves n all. Its now like a small kid can play. Their is no fun n pressure of making the right punch or through as the good old days. If you guys can make a lit like that, then its will more gold in a gold mine. Otherwise is a nice game.  Thank you",
        "Samsung Galaxy S6... Alright, they went and fixed the release bug crashes within a day or two. I finally got to enjoy the game. It's pretty decent. I'm enjoying the whole fighting/build your characters concept. As promised, I've raised my rating. (Probably could give more on the post mission drops) other than that, I love how there isn't a limit to how many missions you can do and have to wait for an energy bar to replenish. Great game so far. (Give more on the drops though lol... seriously)",
        "First off, the thought of the game and concept of direction it went in for a mobile game is fair, I'll give it that. But... I will say, being one of the best franchises ever created, I expected more. Not another knockoff style of Marvel and DC's (and MK's) style of fighting game. I expected originality from an original creator. The having to heal and near impossibility of play at a certain point (unless you pay a lot...) steered me away from it, tbh.",
        "As a long time Tekken fan I am happy that we have a version for mobile. I am also quite impressed with how smooth the gameplay is. The graphics are impressive for mobile. I'm underwhelmed by the controls though.  For me Tekken is all about the controls, and while I didn't expect a full controller interface. I feel like there could have been a better control layout available. Also the interface and game play menus feel quite busy, like there is too much going on. They could take a note from the wb fighters on mobile in this regard."

Major ones are fine and expected but to have to be a jerk to someone because you don't have enough kind of sucks a little. But it's not often and by no means a deal breaker.",
        "Actually, I came here because I'm a fan of Jakayla Toney. I'm a reader from wattpad, and I'm checking out her story here as game. 😂 Anyways, I finished one chapter and I'm enjoying so far. Gotta check out other book after I'm done. Looking forward to this app, though I don't really like the choices costing gems.But its okay, still like it. 😊",
        "Every GOOD choice involved money.  Hard to find one interactive story game that doesn't involve money so much.  I don't mind paying for extra bonus scenes in the end but at least give us some GOOD selection WITHOUT charging!  Then maybe I'll rate it higher",
        "I'm frustrated by the fact that this is supposed to be a choose your own adventure game, but all the choices that make the most sense to me are stuck behind a paywall, requiring me to purchase those choices with a currency called diamonds. I get the story passes, and I would have been fine if that was the only barrier to read the story, but to require you to pay money for making what you feel are the right choices is just greedy.",
        "The only reason I'm giving 3 stars is because the chapters update too late that you lose interest and sometimes forget what's happening in the story. If the chapters were to update on a regular basis then readers would feel the need to keep this app and will constantly play instead of playing the waiting game. However the content is good and most storylines get you hooked.",
        "I literally have nothing bad to say about this game. It's one of the best story/choices/chapter games out, in my opinion. I'm ready for sequels and the remaining chapters of Bad Boy Blues. Other than that, keep up the good work."

I simply logged in using the same info as when I purchased it. Give it a try. Only real complaint I have is a recent event. I've purchased all unlocks and until now extras, even enjoy the pc version but now even after I've handed out funds they want more money to enjoy features. When I purchased unlocks and extras the last thing I wanna hear is we've added more unlocks for more money, even though you already paid for unlocks.",
        "1.) You used to be able to fast forward game for free... That now has to be upgraded  2.) Everything costs money!!! In order to progress in the game you basically need to purchase the full version 3.) The fungus level is definitely the hardest to get past, played at least 10+ times and still have not won that level because it doesn't give you enough DNA to upgrade. 4.) Game is overall, Ok.  5.) I like the new levels! Like the vampire and ape one. It's pretty cool."

        "It's good and all but I hate the lucky chests scam it always gives me coins also quit paring people up with other people that have higher levels it's completely unfair they get an advantage while we get nothing except getting our trophies taken a way other than that great game",
        "THIS IS THE BEST GAME YOU CAN PLAY ON THE PLAY STORE!!! THERE IS SO MANY COOL WEAPONS AND IT IS SIMILAR TO MINCRAFT BUT WITH GUNS!!! TELL YOUR FRIENDS ABOUT THIS GAME ASAP",
        "Honestly I've player this game before most of the op weapons came in and I think that the old version is better because it rewarded you for how well you do instead of only just getting 1 to 3 coins per game and the occasional 100 plus for level up. Then there are the op weapons which again anyone can get because the game influences the transactions more than gameplay, which is kind of sad for a game that has came a long way, and there are weapons that will go through walls and instant kill you no matter what. So please developers change the game where you can get more coins and some gems from winning games or at least trying and getting a decent score instead of buying your way to the top. I've played this game for a while and have gotten really good at it but it still keeps coming back to the op weapons and their ability to one shot. Things have gotten unfair in the game and most under leveled players will quit outright because there are so many people that pay too much money to get every weapon in the game. So right now as it stands the game could do better in game play than in transactions and would get even more people to come back or join. It's as simple as changing the rewards for winning and change the amount transactions give you.",

Makes you forget about the game sometimes as you can't do anything else untill it's complete. I refuse micro-transactions so this game now only gets visited once every couple of days. It's a shame really as it's great fun to start with.",
        "Provided the developers with evidence of rampant racism, homophobia and misogyny present in the game. They have so far neglected to take any action against the perpetrators. Unacceptable.  Edit: I have already provided screen shots to you via the Help & Support board, you haven't yet taken action. Please do so immediately.",
        "If you've seen this game advertised and thought hey that looks fun you'd be wrong. The ads make this look like a fun army survival type game like epic battle simulator. Its not, its just another money sink 'build a fortress' collect resources. Avoid for the sake of your saniy",
        "This game is not made for people who do not spend money. The devs do not control the players who do and therefore those who do not never get the chance to grow because they are constantly having to use resouces to rebuild their troops and this takes away from being able to advance. The kill event being 3 days straight is for the birds . You got to buy gold to purchase shields or you resouces you work for are plundered and often times your army is wounded above your hospital limit so you have to constantly use resouces to be able to heal them.  I just don't understand why the game is for people who spend a lot of money and destroy the ego of those who don't!",

        "There is an alliance you should avoid. If you're playing this game, they're called god, they will attack their own teammates and kick you out for no reason. Even though you donated. They also work with other alliances to gang up on random people."

        "PAID VERSION NOT AD FREE! Got sick of the ads in this game cutting off the audio from my podcast in the background, so I bought the PAID version.  Big Mistake!  Fewer ads but they are *much* longer and they can't be skipped or stopped.  I plan to get a refund on this deceptive app!",
        "The game is fun and addictive, and it also has a lot of content but unfortunately there's a bug that hasn't been fixed which is the time. Sometimes on many occasions, the level starts with the time passed like 1-3 minutes. Say I want to get 3 stars in a level by finishing it under 2 minutes and 30 seconds. When I start it, immediately one minute and a half are past without me doing anything and I have to restart the level to get it to zero. Sometimes I forget and end up finishing the level with 2 stars because of that bug and having to restart the level once again. I appreciate your support and offering the game for free but don't forget to get a fix for this bug, please. Thanks 🌹",
        "I enjoyed that it is challenging but still easy enough to feel like it's not impossible. However, there is at least one ad before every level, and sometimes 2-3 ads will come up for each level and this will probably be the reason I end up deleting it.",
        "Fun addictive love it the music the side effects all of it even my six year old daughter likes this game it's fun it's challenging for her it's not your typical solitaire and she's only 6 years old and already she loves it the higher the level the more she said Love's to figure it out great game wonderful brain game for small children teaching strategies great job guys two thumbs way up",
        "Impossible to enjoy game play due to excessively intrusive advertising.  One can't even shuffle without being forced to watch another ad. Banner ads, long boring ads between each level, jammed into players brains (so the developers wish).  I am immune to advertising and simply tune it all out. My only reaction being to UNINSTALL this otherwise enjoyable game and warn others about it's predatory intent.",
        "You get an ad between every game, but its not annoying for me. They're easy to skip. They gotta make money somehow, right? Other than that, the game is really neat and fun to play."

Im on the matching game for so long and then it exits itself and when I open it from recent activity it starts over, Angela tired but no credit for the coins I earned. SO UNFAIR.",

        "Fun until you get to Miami.. absolutely impossible to make 100 000.00 to unlock the next level.  Computer outbids or up bids you so that you either give up or lose your money.  No daily incentives to keep brining you back.  Unless you are willing to spend real money for boosters and money to move on.. play to Miami and then delete.. impossible to move forward after that.",
        "The game was addictive and fun until you get to Miami. 100k to unlock that level is absurd and unrealistic. Its to hard to make that kind of money playing and now its just playing the same level over and over trying to get enough. Now its boring!! I'm disappointed, I really enjoyed playing until that point.",
        "Was a great game until I got to Miami level 19 now just bloody stupid & waste of time. I went to 4 straight auctions couldn't buy a unit because competitors bid more than what the units worth how are you suppose to level up & move on when the designers of the game make stupid unrealistic flaws in the game no bidder is going to bid in real life on items they can't see or know are there so why put this into the game? Fix this issue & I will adjust my review accordingly!",

Not only is this game  challenging and exciting,  but NO ADS.  5 stars from me",

        "All of this is absolutely amazing. I have social anxiety, and the first time I played this (which was minutes ago) helped me so much. I could simply get lost in my own little world- or should I say oasis- for a while so I can calm down. Also the little messages are very sweet, and I love the artstyle! All in all this is a fantastic game, I wholeheartedly love it. C:",
        "I like it a lot but I only wish I could turn off the SFX for tapping and leave the BGM and ambient noises (like rain from the weather and rain cloud) on. Other than that, the ads are subtle and unobtrusive, the bonuses reasonably helpful for the cost, and the shop is nice (but unnecessary! You can enjoy the game without it. )",
        "Ads, ads and more ads. Rated family friendly but ads include electric cigarettes and lottery. Not exactly family friendly. The game is based on tapping to gain hearts to buy things to gain more hearts. Neat except it's nearly impossible to avoid the ads, which seem to be nothing but electric cigarettes and lottery ads (more than 6/10). Even when you're trying to play without ads, you will inevitably tap one of those inspirational messages from one of the animals or plants and launch an ad.",
        "I really love the inspirational phrases that pop up randomly. It really changes my mood when I read one. The only thing is that I wish this could have a journal section. Where I could write thoughts down or a gratitude journal where you write 3 good things that happen today and you could double your hearts. It would help level up the land faster and for people that are using this as a pick me up app. It would help us put our thoughts down all in the same place. :)",
        "I've only been playing this game for about 30 minutes and I can already say this game is one I'll be playing for a long while. I have a job interview coming up and boy does this relieve my anxiety! The little bubbles of encouragement is a very nice touch! They make me feel warm and fuzzy.",
        "The Ad. we're too long to enjoy the game! Sometimes it shows that I should rotate the screen to display Ad. but I have rotated the screen and cannot resolve the situation. All I can do was press the home button ànd kill the process fróm recent APP list then relaunch the APP."

        "Uninstalling!!! Took less than 24 hrs to take 300 million i won away. Payed off great for the first 20 levels. I was thinking \"finally a slot that pays!\" Sat and played it for hours straight to try and build up the bank. Made it to level 23 and the game just stopped paying. I know you want us to make purchases but how is anyone going to want to purchase if it just depletes your winnings that fast. I'm done!!",
        "Great slot game, graphics, music, bonuses, all terrific, I really enjoy this game, very addicting, I want to play it in my sleep. All true, I don't have to lie to kick it. Thank you.   One more thing, do you guys really read these reviews? You people are geniuses. It may take me forever to finish this game, so you have a friend for life now. Hasta luego. I will never finish because it is impossible to do for free.",
        "Great Graphics. Over 2.5 GB Big. Uses a lot of data. Starts out Winning, Then You Lose Quick. HARD to regain. Higher & Higher Achievements needed that are Tough to Win. Wants YOUR Cash ! IF it were in a Real Casino-people would Walk Away. I Played over 19 weeks. Thats ALL !!!",
        "Honestlt this is worse then playing at a real casino this is supposed to be a game and yet the slots dont let u win anything im brand new to this and have been stuck on the same mission for 7 days because i cant win any coins. One spin out of 150 gives coins and then u lose everything its stupid and annoying. I feel u only win if u pay with real money. Increasing ur bet doesnt help the odds of winning either. This is a video game not a real casino payouts should be more fair",
        "Great graphics. Games kept a fast pace with  winnings one on top of the other. No boring games here. Other apps I have played are not quite so generous with coin winnings meaning if you want to keep playing, you need to buy, buy, buy.",
        "It's fun when you just start. You never lose. Like most casino apps, once you've played for awhile, you never win. Maybe someday the creators of these types of apps will realize that people will purchase their chips if they feel it's worth it. They'll always have those folks who will throw their money at the game, but you'll have people like me who will never purchase coins from a game that takes much and gives little or nothing in return. I will be deleting this game just like all the others before."

It sucks that they ruined this app, looking at the iOS version its obvious they haven't bothered to update this in years.",
        "This game is AMAZING. YOU DEFINITELY need it. There is only 1 thing that I hope this game will have, I really want them to have CPU's on multi-player and on tournaments and duels because it says check your internet connection when I try to play them. But still this game is the best. So if you're searching for a game just get BIKE race and you probably won't need any other game.",
        "Overall, the game is OK . But there is a few issues. My bike tips back and I can't stop it from tipping back until I die. But this doesn't happen all the time. It happens about every five weeks. Also, I was given a 5$ gift card and a 10$ gift card but I can't buy any of the bikes.",
        "It's a fun little game at first, but has many, many flaws. You have to link it to your Facebook account if you wanna play all maps. There are way too many ads, they force you to buy their bikes which are ridiculously overpriced and overpowered, so you can't play multiplayer because people who bought those bikes will always beat you. That's just ridiculous. Not to mention it's very buggy. Sometimes you're racing someone who's in a completely different track than you. It used to be fun, now it's just stupid.",
        "Been playing for a few years and absolutely love the game.  Got a new phone, Moto G5 Plus, and now there is a half second pause every time I hit the gas or break in every race.  Extremely annoying when you're racing friends.",
        "Fun game but its lame the only bikes that have boosted stats are super expensive. And it's really dumb that the stats don't scale up with the cost of the bike. They have a range of 100 to 350 with the ultra bike and 300 for the super bike, that leaves plenty of room for various speed levels. The helmet and trick type perks are cool but not enough of an incentive. Need more to play, pay, or fight for."

Make each car have its own sound, the sounds they're supposed to have. Add the car stats and add a nitro feature. Add the brand each car is supposed to have. Make the cars spit fire!. Add weather conditions like rain, thunderstorm, lightning, and windy. Please add cars like: Ferrari F50 GT, W Motors Lykan Hypersport, Ferrari FXX Evoluzione, Hennessey Venom GT, Bugatti Chiron, Ferrari FXX K, McLaren P1, Dodge Challenger SRT, Chevrolet Camaro SS, Lamborghini Aventador LP700-4, Lamborghini Veneno, Chevrolet Corvette Z06 C7r, Ferrari 458 Italia, McLaren F1 GTR, even the Devel Sixteen Prototype. Please add these cars on the next update!. If you can, add them in packs!",
        "I can't say I love it,maybe I can. But any way, this would have to be in one of top hundred games😀. There are a few things I would like added though. Maybe add a driver cause that make it more realistic and maybe a few new cars  and definitely some people walking around doing random stuff. And maybe fix the sensitivity unless I missed that. So yeah really enjoyed this😀😁😀😁😀😁.",
        "I think you guys have messed up your game in the past few updates. Seems like there is some memory leak or something. After a while the steering wheel lags so much. Only the input. Graphics don't lag at all. Please fix. Also would be great if you could add some button to start and stop a timer in free mode so we can set time challenges for ourselves. I like the game but it is unplayable after a few minutes after the recent updates",
        "What you should improve is that YOU NEED TO REMOVE THE ADD's I MEAN SERIOUSLY I WATCH MORE ADDS THAN THE GAMEPLAY. I ONLY PLAY FOR A LITTLE THEN MOST OF ADDS SHOW UP. I WQ5CH ADDS THAN PLAY8NG THE GAME FOR CRYING OT LOUD!!",

        "This has to be like, my 5th or 6th reinstallment of this game since there's no ingame reset, but darn well worth the data(little bytes). I usually like more realistic car games, but even the \"extreme\" warp in physics in the gameplay doesn't distract from the fun. These are the cars you'd want if you're trying to beat the traffic, run from the cops, or solve a parking dillemma. Great fun time killer! One thing though, the other reviewers are correct in their complaints about how often and when ads pop up. That shouldn't happen smack dab in the middle of a maneuver."

Because we have to waiting for it to be downloaded before can play again. Can we choose to update whenever we want?  Anyway, this is a really nice game and I've been playing it for a long time. Keep up the good work!",
        "I love the game. There's nothing wrong with it because I feel like it's the old game that I grew up with. But what I hate is that the prices for packs, lp, sp and simoleons went high. The prices before was okay but now I don't think I will spend anymore for packs that give only like 5vip points. Such a fun game but aimes for large microtransactions.",
        "I really enjoy this game, and love developing my Sim's homes and the world. Unfortunately, my game won't open. It hasn't for about a month now, even after this new update. It shows me the loading screen for five minutes, then crashes. It would be wonderful if there could be a fix for this.",
        "Love love love it! This game is actually better than The Sims Mobile... 2 problems,, 1st. The Modern houses with second floor, so expensive😭! 2nd. The time it sometimes takes ages just for one activity!😐 but hey, everything else.. TOTALY AWSOME! 😍 thanks so much for creating this game. Cuz its so hard to download the sims 4 in a Mobile. 💕",
        "This is actually cool and I really love this game. However, the expiration of most of the quest that i'm having are only 2 days to finish. I think it's unfair, and the materials needed are too expensive. Sims are busy on finishing tasks so they won't be able to go to work and earn. So I'm not totally enjoying the game.",
        "When you get an event sometimes it only lasts for like 2 days which really isn't enough because some actions take 1 day. Please extend event times and don't give like 5 events at the same time. Also you should be able to log in other ways apart from Facebook because lots of people don't have Facebook.

The pictures showing the terrains is probably copied off of MCPE's pictures (I am not saying it is! But it might be). I really like this game I really do but there needs to be some changes. People aren't going to like this game if there isn't some changes. I just read a comment saying this game is \"gay\". That was incredibly rude. People shouldn't call it \"dumb\" or \"gay\" just because this game needs better graphics or it has to many ads. Does anyone even know the definition of \"gay\"? There is two meanings for it but they both mean your happy! Stop calling the game names! It is not necessary to!",
        "I love this game, it's sooooo fun but my only problem is the ads. It was fine when I first downloaded it, there were no ads but after I upgrade the game, all of a sudden there's ads every second. If you can get rid of the ads, I would greatly appreciate it",
        "There's so many things wrong with this I don't even know where to start. First off your in a confined space and if you go so far you just hit a blue wall. If in was infinitely generated and you could go farther it might be better. Second its kind of slow when moving. Third since the whole confined space thing you have each different biome all pushed together so when you walk two steps your in a different biome and its small. So you extremely need to make it better.",
        "So, the game itself is incredibly enjoyable and fun. Sometimes the controls get me here and there, but I'm sure, with time, I'd get use to it. The thing is, THERE IS NO TIME. Literally every minute, I get a thirty second ad. I'm just here building my home and making foundation when all of a sudden, an ad pops up. I say, \"oh okay, it's just one, whatevs.\" WRONG. It is now ten, just over the past 5 minutes. This game has serious potential, if only it'd let us play the game and cut out the ads. I'm spending more time watching ads rather than using time to efficiently play the game. It irks me, so I uninstalled the ap. It really is a good game, just lower the ads from 2 per minute, kay?",

        "Before the update it was quick to grind lots of cash but still it took some time. With my current build, I was reaching 10k+ averaging Greats and Awesomes but now after the update I barely scratch 8K! You guys nerfd the fuccc out the rocket power!!! NEW PLAYERS DON'T EVEN BOTHER WITH THIS! IT WILL TAKE YOU A VERY, VERY, VERY LONG TIME TO GRIND!!!",
        "Good game, played it over a long period here and there and I've basically completed it.  Would love to see more planets! And bigger challenges, as currently every time I go on it my little explorers are making over 1.5 million a day and I've got no where to take my space funding! Haha   Great game imo, just needs more features, planets, asteroids maybe. :) Good job.",
        "A very fun game that is both simple and a bit challenging because you have to make literal split-second taps to get it to work properly. The only downside is that it's a very short game. There are only two places to colonize and once you've done them and reached level 10 on both, there's really nothing left to do. It would be nice if they added more levels to colonize or some other form of continuation.",
        "Be cool if there is boosts. Example if you get 3 perfect you get a free auto perfect boost or something. Also plz add a line of code to stop people from the date/time bug abuse - save current time to file. Player won't get money till that last input time has passed.  Also be cool to spend the coins on boosts",
        "Very cool and challenging. 20 seconds game that has taken several hours. Graphics are amazing and victory audio also. Needs lot's more planets and more ships, only 2 planets is a shame. Speed and other gages would be nice. A flag in each planet. Ads didn't bother me that much. 5 stars for the team",
        "It's a fun game, just need more planets to jump to and more rocket skins. The colony is just a bunch of people standing on the planet. When I think of colony, I think of buildings and sustaining life and such. Would be nice to see the 'colony' grow bigger each time you rank up. (Example, more buildings etc.) Also, a choice of a button to press when detaching the rocket and different rocket shapes to choose from. Thank you"

        "I reckon this game is so good! I reckon it needs a test mode track so when you finish fixing the car fully to 100% you can test it. And probably alot more cars to fix, and also instead of having just one place where there are garages. You can go all over the world to different type of country's where there are different cars like Australia has commodores, Japan of skyline etc. Love this game so much ❤ hope you take this into exception",
        "Overall the game is exactly what you think it would be, a mobile version of car mechanic simulator 2018. That being said the rotate and zoom features of the camera can be a little irritating at times. It's also very hard to make money to get to your 4th level of tools when you can't completely repair the majority of cars that you get. It can be a little frustrating to purchase a car only to realize that you cannot completely restore it.",
        "Great game and efforts of game generating team are appreciated. I wld suggest to add few things like  tires wheel rims tinted glass at extra cost and if used will pay more while selling. Also sometimes when we buy car from barn in some cases few parts could be made missing so that player wld need to search and then purchase new to add more fun. After u get all tools and all cards then it is boaring....",
        "Trying to find a support link?? I have all tools yet wont give me a bonus.... Love the game. Camera can be a pain sometimes but you learn where to and where not to touch parts. Also why not have buyers or clients stop in... Finishing a car 100% and only making 2k after putting wok into the car Then 10k into parts... I would fire the guy selling cars... Just my two cents.",
        "For the developers: this game is broken. I play on tablet Galaxi tab A   Start the game Remove battery Buy new battery Install new battery Cant tap the sell option Game freeze Nothing work Retart the game 5 times always the same",
        "Nothing like the older apps like this. Camera control is hard, going from warehouse to parts catalogue constantly to remember bad parts to replace is a pain, then an add plays further impairing your memory. Disassembly  got way less interactive and so far I can't repair parts, just  purchase from a catalog."

        "It has a lot of bugs, but it's a fun game. It has a lot of potential, if you decide to keep on working on it. One major bug that i've noticed is ITEM DOESN'T EXIST. For instance i saw a Scar laying down on the gorund in Military base and when i tried to pick it up it said \"item doesn't exist\". Fix this please, otherwise, a decent game.",
        "Everything is well put together tmain thing I love is that each area is different from on another like at the school ive had alot of vertical fire fights or power plant or the supermarket. But one thing I think u guys forgot is that the ump 45 takes .45 acp rounds",
        "Controls are terrible. When aiming directly at a player between the crosshairs. Bullets still miss. Terrible game if you're reading this go download rules of survival. That's  what I did. Also sometimes during the middle of a game a loading icon will appear. You won't be able to move or shoot your weapon. You'll pretty much die. When in the safe zone you will still take damage even tho you are in the white circle. To many hackers.",
        "I love this game free fire and this game are my favorite mobile games so far but there should be some changes like you should be able to aim with an iron sight. And the aiming could be better and what I mean by that is aiming is already hard on mobile so I just think stability should be really good without any attachments or like the aiming system on free fire battleground. The graphics are not the best I've seen really just up the graphics a bit and add the ability to aim with a iron sight. Other than those things I love how exciting the game is as well as how close it is to pubg.",
        "Mind Blowing Game..But Could You Guys Please Include \"Voice Chat\" It will Make the game more Awesome.. Its so tough To Contact With Team Mates. In chat box By typing..Please..see in thus matter.. #Devlorpes"

Players and teams will be ranked for the match in the order they are eliminated.The safe zone changes randomly in each match, providing players with a fresher, more intense experience each time.Remember, find a weapon and supplies as quickly as you can and then move to the island’s safe zone.This is not just a game, this is battle for survival!!!PLEASE NOTE!

I fully upgraded my first starter and reserve and now i have like 50000 in money and can't buy anything since it all requires gold not cash. If it was cash not gold i would give it 5 stars in an instant",
        "I am amending my original 5 star review. I am now giving this game 1 star due to the feature that claims to allow you to earn more gold. I tried a couple of different offers which involved \"a quick survey and email address\". This was complete BS. They were both endless loops of surveys and information mines, and never was given my promised reward after completing the initial survey. This is very dishonest and extremely annoying. So annoying that it prompted me to take the time to change my 5 star review to 1 star.",

        "The level design is fine and the graphics is nice to look at. I like that it isn't always a course of multiple levels, but individual levels, it fits better for an on the go game. My main problem is with the controls and physics. You can hit a wall straight on and instead of bouncing back, like you would expect, it slows the ball down to a stop and just roll it a little to the side, these unpredictable physics make it hard to determine where your ball will go. And the camera controls is quite annoying, the swiping is way more intuitive and natural but is way too slow for turning 180 degrees. The button controls is too fast when trying to precision your shot.  These issues are, for me, a deal breaker and is the reason why I will not be playing this again. Though the gameplay was enjoyable when working. I have been looking for a casual golf game, and hoped this could be it, based on the more than stellar reviews.",

        "I absolutely love this game! I got it only a week ago as I have played it previously on other peoples devices and it did not disappoint!  However one problem is the game not unlocking vehicles, maps, and helmets. The biggest example of this is the turbo turtles mission. I am somehow not able to unlock the turtle and skeleton knight even after completing it in various different ways. Even so, this game is an absolute must have for people who want to have a mix of competitiveness and fun!",

        "It takes 6 hours to incubate an egg. Find this ridiculous. Make it 1 hour at least. Fire rush lasted less or about 5 seconds which it will be nicer if it can last more than that. Enemy attacks take away your lifepoints more than you get when you eat them. Even from small enemies. No brainer to have giant monsters or flying ships if you don't earn any score points or lifepoints when you crush them. Enemy dragons just need to attack once and you will die instantly which is ridiculous as well. No brainer too that you have different levels of dragons to choose from but all have the same boost level. And what's the point of having the same tier dragons? S dragon upgrade to the next S dragon and to the next S and finally, then you can get an M dragon??? If you can skip this, it would be nice.  Other than all that, game is nice.

        "Awesome classic and how a port should be done.  The controls are wonderful, its great using all my gamepads to play. I love how all these great ports to android support that. Playing Sonic 1, Sonic 2, and Sonic CD all with gamepad. Tested on and working great on my Note 3, Note 8 Tablet, Pixel XL, and on Zidoo x10 . Edit: I formatted my phone , i reinstalled the game, clicked on restore purchase, but it takes me to an item not found. 1 star rating until I can restore my purchase, or at least access to a paid version again. Will rate back to 5 when I can play ad free again. Edit2: I found the way to fix restore purchase. Don't click restore purchase, just click on buy ad free, and it says it's restored and does not re-charge for payment.",
        "I only have negative reviews because untried purchasing this game through the app THREE TIMES.  I still do not have the ad free version.  Please contact me, I purchased the full version so my daughter can have access to all levels, and I still have the ad supported version.   I'm even willing to pay for it again (so my daughter can have fun) please help me Sega.",
        "4 stars because i dont know how to play as tails/knuckles. EDIT: This game, I'm starting to get nostalgia, and also, this game brings back the amazing cheat.... DEBUG MODE!!! #SegaIsTheBest EDIT 2: Changed to 5 stars cause I learned to do Sonic & Tails and play as Tails/Knuckles",
        "A fantastic port of a platformer that still holds up to modern titles. It's pretty, the music is great, the gameplay is varied and fast, and the overall experience is just pleasant. The touch controls can take a little breaking in but overall they do the job. Unfortunately, there's a blemish in the level design that ruins the rest of what the game has going for it: labyrinth zone stage three. The rest of the game's difficulty is based around reflexes and timing. The difficulty in this level is shooting the controls in the knee and tricking the player into a boss fight with no health. This level plays nothing like the rest of the title and it makes one wonder if the developers actually knew what they were doing or just caught lightning in a bottle.",
        "The controls are unresponsive. half the time I die because I'll just randomly stop moving. I have to dig my thumb into the screen for it to read anything you guys need to add sensitivity adjustment to the settings.",
        "I agree the controls are really difficult. I played this game when it first came to the us via the Sega Genesis and those controls were way better. If you truly want to play this game right get one of those joystick accessories, otherwise good luck. It seems to go okay in the levels but beating Robotnic is much, much harder."

Also, when I paid to have the ads removed, I discovered I still get bombarded by ads whenever I try to take a \"second chance\". It's a fun game if you can ignore the haptic feedback issue and don't buy the paid version.",

There's an ad that actually covers part of the game while you are playing. Ads are to be expected in free apps but when you put that many it ends up chasing people away.",

While I'm playing it'll just end the game. I was so happy to have made it as high as I was, the balls were coming out if the top, nothing on the top level, then it ended the game-while in motion. I didn't want to start over at 1 again. :(",

        "Been playing since goblins vs gnomes (2014) and still play today. Not a diehard player, but as my buddy put it, \"hearthstone is the best toilet game ever\". It's pretty simple and easy to learn. Newer and f2p players have a bit of a rough go, but you can easily keep pace in this game for less than $100 a year.",
        "It's a fun game for a while before you will get frustating. Too much depending on luck no matter how good your deck is if you couldnt get the card to do your combo its useless againt an opponant that have better draw than you.  Also if you are free to play you have to be petient to get ass kick for a while till you have luck enough to get some useful legend card.",
        "I love card games and this got some awesome elements. However... The randomness and luck in this game is pure bs. You can be in a winning position and still lose because of 1 in a 10000000 chance of the oponent getting lucky. Even when I win I feel bad from winning because I know the oponet was unlucky.... It is very rare I get a game where I think. This game was awesome because we both did our best.",
        "I never even got to play. I have now tried to install 3x. The first two times the app became unresponsive. The third it caused my phone to crash and reboot. I have a pixel which should be perfectly capable of running it. If not then don't offer it for this device. First blizzard product that's ever pissed me off.",
        "Great game! Love all the really cool animations! I do have a problem that since I installed the game, my store has been closed 😐 I am installing it on PC right now to see if I can get to the store there. Game play is awesome though!",
        "Really fun game. 3 stars cause it closes very easily. If I get a phone call even when I dont answer the game closes.even on wifi it closes. Then it takes too long to reload causing me to lose a turn. This is the worst in arena because losing one turn will kill you and it becomes a waste of gold. Please do whatever you can to solve this problem."

        "Amazing game very addictive...  Love the fact that they have a specials  more often... Also like the events with the second hospitals... Would like if we had special events more often... Just wish we had a platform to save the game my sister had to restart the game 6 times i had to do it twice... Wou be great to save progress on fb or another platform... Even log in  Really frustrating when we lose progress.... I only need 5 more characters then I'll have them all... So if i lose progress again im not starting over  Overall my favorite game on my phone!! Thx",
        "I couldn't get enough patients, I couldn't get enough cash, and my staff energy seemed to drain way too fast. I love the surgery games but you maybe get one of those a day. I ended up uninstalling when room upgrades said they would take 12 hours. Too much waiting, not enough action. I liked the story so far too. Maybe I'll reinstall in the future if the times go down.",
        "It's a great game at first, but it takes so long to upgrade or save money or anything that you end up spending a lot of your real life money. Plus the surgeries all start to be the exact same, and the glitches... oh, the glitches. Zapped $200,000 out of my bank, and that bloody epinephrine shot is impossible to get without striking out. Oh, and $120,000 for research that will only make you $4,000? Why is everything so time and resource consuming???",
        "Controls don't work properly during surgery! There is lot of lag while performing an action while the timer works properly. Moreover, it doesn't allow me to suture the skin, even if I'm trying to do it right (it worked at the begining). Please fix these bugs or I will uninstal the game...",
        "Love the overall feel of this, though some things need tweeking. For example, I only have half of the staff available and am now getting far too many duplicate cards concidering how many I have left to get. Makes it feel all too much like it's pushing people to spend real money, something that always ends with me deleting the game and moving on. Hope this doesn't happen in this case, but I'm not holding my breath...",
        "It's a nice game, I like the concept, you get to operate on patients and manage a hospital. Problem with the recruitment part, it was always giving me surgeons and wasted 200 hearts on the same person. There should be an option if you want to fire someone or replace with another staff. The biggest issue is with their connectivity, internet connection is very stable works with all apps except for this one, no idea why. Fix it please I would hate to delete this game. Thanks."

I wish there was chestplates instead of amulets and leggings instead of bracelets and an easier way to find out what your hero level, But else then that it was perfect. I loved how you can choose the controls to your own preference. Chame on anyone who gave it a less then 5 Star review. I still dont know ho to tell what your hero level was but still my favorite game.",

The only problem is that you need to be a certain level to buy something and how there's only boots and helmets, and no chest plates or leggings, but when I first played it I was shocked to find 2 problems in an amazing app! 5 stars everything! Also, you should make huge, amazing looking, almost impossible bosses that will make me flip my table when I can't beat them! Keep making more awesome games!",

No silly energy system to make you wait to play, and while it has a real money store, it's tucked away in a corner where it belongs. Different control options and simple, accessible gameplay make this a hidden gem. 5 stars all the way. Kudos to the developer.",
        "I'm really loving this game it's simple but still a ton of fun. My one complaint would be the sometimes the grind is too long and I almost gave up... I wish the developers would throw in some kind of experience boost in the store instead of just being able to buy coins. I would pay real money for an exp boost and would love to support the Developers! just give me the chance!",

Stupidest thing ever. One tip. Play the campagin lvls to lvl 40. Then dont do campagin at all and run hell for gold and xp. Repeqt to lvl 80 and then get rekt by the stupid item upgrade system."

        "Good I hope they fixed the bug where you double buy a car and it gives you the same car but still takes your money. But its still a great game. Ohh! And also raise thr chance if getting a legendary I played for almost a year and I never got one l. My friend got one all the time on his apple but there Is a glitch with android.ive never had one.",
        "Good, but has some bugs I'm sorry if I'm being too critical in this review but especially on Mobile Data, Smashy Road can lag. This is to the extent the game will no longer work. Moving on to a positive, the graphical interface is very nice, the perspective, movement and background vehicles is very well created.  Very good game overall",
        "It's good but... I enjoy playing this game, there isn't too much skill involved but it's a good way to kill time and it stays easy enough to make it enjoyable while raising the difficulty.  The only thing I want to see is no more of this, automatically backing up stuff. When you are nose first in an object, the game automatically backs you up, but I've lost countless games because it doesn't stop or doesn't back up enough. Let me choose when to back up!",
        "Awesome It's a very good game, great graphics even for a bunch of cubes, but I also have an idea. You guys should make a game called smashy water, where we can choose from a wide variety of different boats that run away from boat police. Hopefully I helped you with my idea and I will download if made;-). You can work on the title if needed. Please reply:-)",
        "Excellent could use weapon pickup like smoke machine gun or oil slick.... A health bar which is unique to each vehicle depending on if it is made for speed or for just ramming stuff and an add health pickup... a bouncing red or blue stack of cash equal to a hundred dollars once action picks up and a 1000 dollar pickup after a ten minute counter for those who have gotten very good and lastly an arrest count down when stopped.... Sometimes you get only a breif second to get away other times you get like ten seconds???",
        "Good but... you can sometimes glich and get trapped but it's a good game anyway like you run from police. Also when you start off you have to press right or left to start so you can't go straight forward when you get on. I really liked it though it is one of my favourite games! I'm out  Later ima go play some Smashy Road now!"

        "I had this game a long time ago and it is one of the best games out there. It hasent changed since when I usted to have it it would be nice to get some new maps or bikes and maybe change the layout of the menu. And maybe even a multipler more where u play with other people/friends and just free ride or challenge to see who can get more points. Other then that it is a crazy fun and addictive game.",
        "Awesome!!!! It's an awesome  game.......But(there's always a 'but' coming from me ;-) )......You should work on the reality glitches. Like when you start, in the first levels(the docks)...You move and the bike rolls down but when you move up the next slope it doesnt....You should work on that. One more thing......You should not keep all levels payed. You should keep it like, if you beat a certain record or you finish the course faster than the time given already. Otherwise, HATS OFF TO YOU ILLUSION LABS...GREAT WORK!!!",
        "LMAO, how pathetic. Not even possible to control this garbage.  It is nice to see that your level of dedication matches the skateboard version of the game though, along with the PC version, and that you continue to abandon your paid software, you thieves.",
        "I liked the game a lot. The graphics are great and the tricks are to I loved every thing about. But the one thing I do not like is that ther is no free ride. I think it would be better if ther were skate parks and stuff like that to ride on.     😀💚GREAT GAME💚😀",
        "I really enjoyed this game till now... I completed all the challenges on docks and have 200 adrenaline but haven't unlocked next map!?! I went online and researched it and you apparently need 210 adrenaline but there is no way to get it so you have to burly full game!!! This is a money scam",
        "Good game, but tell me why I have to pay 5 dollars just to get more than one map! Deleting solely for this, because ive already done all the challenges and medals."

        "Simply wonderful app!! My daughter's speech is delayed and I introduced this to her at 17months. By 20months, we were hearing her sounding out the letters after it's repeated in the app and she has learnt to choose the correct letter when asked by the app. She couldn't get enough of it! Now we've moved on to shapes and colours that she's working through now at 22months. It's truly amazing. Thank u for no ads. Beautiful graphics. No issues with touch or connecting. Would love British English version tho where 'Z' sounds out as 'Zed.'",
        "I absolutely love this app! My child has learnt so much from this along with all the other apps similar as well. There are no adds which is very much appreciated with a 3 year old that will click on anything. I would recommend to anyone!!",
        "Please check shape matching. My son got little confused between pentagon and hexagon because in app it is telling pentagon shape as hexagon. Might be I am wrong.",
        "Amazing app for toddlers. My 2 girls LOVE it. I like how after they say each letter they sound out the letters. And for the other section where the \"a is for apple\" i think it should be the whole alphabet instead of just a few selection of letters. Because some times the letters repeat.. Like they're learning on just letters j or a.. Etc. Idk if you understand me or not. Oh well just my opinion but THANK YOU Also, for those of you saying it has bugs or its very glitched. CHECK YOUR CONNECTION. most of the time when that happens its because either your phone is sh** or you have bad service. Get on that WI-FI",
        "A great app love the fact that they included games for the parent LOL  I would like a continuous flow though instead of having to press the forward button every time  you're done with one segment",
        "2 year old loves this! She already knew all her letters, I'm so glad that I found this fun way to take her to the next step!!! My only suggestion is that it would be really cool if the praise word for completing a letter started with the same letter. For instance, when they write \"A\" the congratulatory word could be \"Amazing\", \"B\" is \"Bravo\", \"F\" is \"Fantastic\", etc."

Each time when u invite me to rate this app i was thinking that i shall rate this 5 if i win the 75th level. Now iam satisfied.... Great timepass.. Nice tactics, waiting 4 more awsome funny levels. If anybody has any diffrnt opinion cntact me on telegram @chichu  this is my user name. Thnx 4 thiz awsome gift babe.",
        "The game is really interesting and entertaining. The graphics are smooth and and the controls are manageable.   The thing I disliked through my game play is that you don't get any clues what you have to do and/or how to defeat the new \"enemies\". While you understand what exactly you have to do, you've lost some lives. But that's not so important.  I will strongly recommend this game just because of its graphics, entertainment and due the fact, that this game is not pay-to-win game.",
        "I really liked this game. The levels are very challenging and this game is addictive and fun. The only issue is that there are only 5 short lives  that when our lives ran out, we have to wait 18-19 minutes long to have 5 lives again. Of course, there are many hard levels in the game that keeps us dying and think a way to pass the level. So if possible, please shorten the time, like 5-7 minutes only and let us really enjoy the game. It's more even challenging and thrilling if there are many lives. And this game will be really perfect for us. Thank you.",
        "Remember the old days when platformers taught you through trial and error how to interact with new game mechanics? If you don't like that, you'll hate this game. So much fun, so creative, and once you start to get down one of the new features, it ramps it up and keeps you learning creatively how to beat the level. I love this game, it's a fantastic platformer that will challenge you to learn as you go instead of giving you a tutorial every time something new comes up.",
        "Completed all but just couldn't get enough of it. Everyone should play Redball 4. It is D best android games I've ever played. Those who complained about the Game play and control has an abnormal thumb. Easy, Fun & Challenging but nothing impossible to get through. I just hope they make new levels.",
        "I love this game 😍😍 it is my favourite but.... I don't like The lives system . I have to wait for it . I know that there is a pro version but.. can you please give us one or 2 extra lives when we complete a level? I think it's a great idea😋😋 btw i loved it 😍😍😍 ill give it 5 stars then😊😊"

It did stutter for some reason on one of the levels on my galaxy s8, kept flickering for some reason but I forced closed it and restarted and no more issues. Really good job devs!",
        "It's simple yet complicated. It calms my nerves and I initially downloaded it to help me fall asleep. I wanted something that I could mindlessly do and not mess up if I pressed the wrong buttons. But it's also challenging enough to make me think. The graphics are simple yet colorful :)",
        "Good fun and keeps you wanting another round of play. Seems to be easier as you go through, however I'm only 40 plays in, and things may change?.  I hope so. I'll be sure to play on to find out. Can't stop now! THANKS FOR A STRONG GAMEPLAY.",
        "The game is quiet, relaxing, soothing, and all around great to play. I know the advertisements that are played aren't their choice but that's the only downside. After a few rounds you'll get an ad that is excessively loud if your volume is up. The content of the game is great, the ad placement is not.",
        "Indescribable. This game offers a break from reality into a Vista of entertainment. I play hours and hours on end of this game trying to finish that one level. To the people who made this game. Hats off. Absolutely brilliant and I suggest it to everyone looking to spend their entire life playing a masterpiece",
        "Great puzzles. Soothing music in the back to enhance thinking. 2 different modes. Didn't notice that at first. Its pretty cool. I like it. How do I prove this isn't a paid for comment? Idk but I promise I'm real. Try it out. I haven't made it too far but the puzzles are growing in difficulty."

Only if you opt for the secondary game, called \"black mode\", you may need to pay a coffee for it after level 100.I don't feel the game is challenging. Why?The challenge for us would be making the game with increasing difficulty after a certain level while at the same time relaxing and allowing infinity levels. So how could level 100.000 be more difficult than level 10.000? It is hard. So as we cannot have the best in all worlds, we have opted to make it relaxing for now.

I think it might've been better than Rules Of Survival... this game is worth it..... it also lets you to shoot while your friends is driving a vehicle..well, only for duo or squad mode obviously....but what's more, you can actually pilot a helicopter..... nice...",
        "Great graphics with minimum config,controls are awesome  and it has dive button,can jump thru walls and climb windows,way better than the other survival games on phone,it has bullet physics! the only thing im concerned about is The lagging when shoorting from far distances,and id like to suggest a configuration for the graphics to adjust compatibilty . Thank you for this game 5stars! Your doing just great devs!",
        "I love this game and the devs reply to my requests in their official facebook page, thats awesome. One thing I wanna have here is voice chat. Definitely the best even low end devices can play this lag free. I recommend this. I don't know why they rate this so low but it's probably cuz it's not tha popular yet. Keep it up!",
        "I don't know why it got low ratings ....    I want to tell u thie guys..  ur game was absolutely great.... 125 players that impressive....graphics is good.. some minor buys ... plz reduce the sound of the heli...the most important thing is the render distance is soooooooooooo good.... i don't know how it's achived with in 180 MB .... I'm telling u this I really liked ROS....but not any more.....bc In here their is no such a lag and it can in any device... skill based  .. very good rendering distance.. the bullet drop is so realistic...jumping mechanism sooooo great and all this good things come with in 180 MB .. I love u guys.... GREAT WORK. keep it up....I really look up to the next update.......😘😘😙😙👌👌👌👌👍",
        "there are some bugs, that i knew the player is in the building and in his/her phone, but in my phone the player just float in the air its good for me to kill that player, but its not good if the player was me.  fix the building.  add or fix some features like: 1. the distance of the safezone in the mini map. 2. after automaticaly open the door, please make it close automaticaly too. 3. make the control wheel just by move the camera not by the direction arrow. 4. foot step is just too small. 5. make a gun fire radar. 6. make the animation of the character more realistic.  its ok to me if the update makes the game become 500 mb bigger than previous version.  i love this game. its run nicely in my phone.",
        "Hard to attack, easy to die. I already point the crosshair to the enemy, and when I start shooting, the crosshair miss the enemy and start to move around randomly, looks like I attack the ground, and end up died. Also, hard to find weapon and ammo. Your game is good, but not good enough. You are trying to fully copy PUBG, which is played on PC, while your game is Android-Based, hard to control. Hard to control. Easy to aim, but never hit, because the crosshair like to move around and land the bullet on the ground. Try to play Free Fire Battleground by Garena. Overall, Free Fire much better than yours. Uninstalled!"

        "So far, not bad.  Update:  gathered enough parts to repair the university and it won't unlock.  I emailed the developer and haven't heard back.  It is such a cool concept with little to no support or point.  Why gather the materials if we can't use them?  Plus, it took weeks to get the stuff.  Like most cool games, nothing more than a good concept.",
        "You had my attention, and now you have my money. Yes, this is a good game. However, it costs too much real money to advance this game. There are many missing pieces and too much to acquire to be able to progress. Maybe instead of making it so in depth, take it down a notch. Let people use junked cars to fix cars and sell them, if this is already an option make it easier to do so. I think this is a good game just too in depth and not enough give to make it entertaining and fun at this time.",
        "Great game with good potential. I love it. But there are still some minor bugs the car baler somtimes acts weird. And the dismantling process sometimes goes reverse. And then there is the part of collecting building materials. It is too hard and we need to be able to get building materials from elsewhere than the scrap cars. All of them including wood, bricks, and concrete. I am looking forward to the car repair function.",
        "The game is over good. It's definitely fun for your car enthusiasts but I am now level 11 and I can't obtain \"glass\" to build any buildings... The game is getting boring because I can't move up, it's pretty much scrap cars and sell parts... I don't want to rate this game too high because I believe it still is a work in progress, but yes it's a good game and I would recommend it",
        "It's a decent concept. Good time killer for a little while. I don't know why all these games take energy. Just let me play the damn game. And the constantly fluctuating prices to sell the parts got old REAL QUICK! Apparently the creators of this game have never been to a salvage yard in their life.",
        "Great time killer! Simple to play, though a few information/help would be nice for a few items, the auto sell option and the bailer so you know exactly what they do.  The developer does listen to the players and fixes things! Only true issues that I have are 1)the materials needed to build the buildings in incredibly high, not really obtainable for game play, even for someone who would play constantly"

I appreciate the fact that all the \"mandatory\" ads are instantly skippable (and thus much more manageable). The game is beatable and fun even without going through the longer \"optional\" ads (for which the rewards are fair)",

In the process you must control your government and live long enough to make a difference. I have enjoyed this game so far. nothing to fault so far.",
        "One of the very few games to end up as a shortcut on my home screen, it's adaptive - addictive, and endlessly intriguing. The Creator doesn't ask for much in return for such a well delivered game. Don't be cheap! Buy that person a cup of coffee!",
        "I think this game is really good, it was introduced to me by a friend, and I can say that I am glad I kept that friendship alive hahaha. Anyway, this game really helped me see new aspects of topics that I hadn't seen before, and it's a very interesting concept. Cheers to the developer :D.",
        "Well done, just like reign but free and in the future.  Some mechanics are the second but some are different.  There are some strange typos but nothing game breaking.  And there are some options that tell you only information but have a yes and no attached that are slightly confusing (the oil stain on the bed is an example)",
        "Not your average political decision-making game! The storyline brings a high amount of intrigue to the game, and I can positively say I'm about as addicted as I would be to a great book. I can't wait to find all the endings, highly recommended!"

        "Excellent card game.  However as soon as you get passed reasonably priced starter packs you cannot play the game and why not?  Because you play two games then you need to spend huge amounts of money so you can play two more rounds.  Then you need good cards and guess what you have to buy them through a lottery system like gambling highly addictive but after maybe thousands of dollars you get the card you want guess what you need to evolve your card and guess what you need to buy your reagents big dough yet again.  Then when you have spent all your hard earned cash you need to buy special weapons to give yourself a good boost to your cards.  Do you get where this game and a right game it is too. It relies on you getting addicted so you spend all your time and resources on an endless quest for something you will never have uninstalled buy buy.",
        "Amazing game, honestly, top 3 mobile game I've ever played, found an amazing guild and it's loads of fun. No paywall is the crowning achievement in my opinion. One thing, cause I don't know where customer support is, I started a Path of Champion level, and  on the first wave the game crashed and when I logged back on I had no key and didn't have a chance to beat the level",
        "Definitely pay to win. When you scroll up or down it thinks you are clicking on something. Stamina is a nightmare as when you reach a high enough level that takes more xp to level up, you can't play for hours as it takes to long to recharge. Should make gems easier to get for non paying players so it is more fair. Other than that pretty good.",
        "Number one of the best games I have ever played on my phone. I'm watching ads for bonus experience when sacrificing my cards. And I love the fact of that availability. Especially since it pays them which increases chances of more games like this one. Keep up the great work. Really helping my cognitive development of pattern recognition",
        "Great games. Controls suck.  You want to scroll and click a card instead (i know how to swipe) turns are fast paced..sometimes too fast. And as a starter...some of the turn challenges seem a bit unrealistic with the characters provided. Almost like they want to have you spend money off rip. Good game overall....but some things should definitely need work.",
        "It's a lot other games of this type. I haven't been able to find a problem with it yet. Great graphics although the timer is a bit fast when you're looking up connections. If you had a button that the players would push when they couldn't find any more connections, that would be great!"

        "Awesome game. Good graphics, great sound and music, intricate leveling up system and character build, easy controls, variety in enemies, lots of replay value, lots of gear to find, and doesn't take much data space. Reminds me of a Diablo type game. The developer's really do deserve a lot of praise for creating such a quality game and not making it a p2w. This is an example of doing it right. I can tell that a lot of thought and care was put into it. Absolutely brilliant. I can't praise enough. A rare gem on the play store, and completely free. Just awesome. 6 out of 5 rating. Thank you so much for such a great game.:) Edit: Thanks for the update. You guys rock.",
        "Good looking game plays very smoothly. Fun to play and not too hard or too easy. Nice little details like the way your hero talks and has other party members. These things help make the single player game seem less lonely. I don't know if I am going to hit a pay wall or loose interest. The story is engaging enough. I just don't give out 5 star reviews.",
        "Greetings Making Fun,  Let me start off by saying that I absolutely love this game. It's entertaining, challenging and addictive. The storyline is engrossing and the graphics are spectacular as well. You can easily tell how addictive a game is by the amount of time you spend playing it at a stretch. Let me just say that I've been playing this game ever since I installed it. Whenever I sit down with my device, I start playing it and I keep on playing for at least two hours before I divert my attention to other matters. It's a really lovely and delightful game. Making Fun seems like the most suitable title of the developers because they've made something that is really a lot of fun. Well done. I highly recommend this game. DOWNLOAD IT TODAY.",
        "Great game so far! Love the old school feel to the game! Resembles Diablo a lot! But I love the Diablo series so being able to play a game like that from the palm of my hand...GOLD! Tons of customization from characters, skills and equipment upgrades. Most of the better items are obtained just by playing! No need to buy items, save those gems for more skills to adding more companions to fight along side you! Running low on gems...just keep playing! Love a game that rewards you just for playing! Keep up the good work guys! I don't post reviews unless it's worth it so......see you out there!",
        "The gameplay is the best ive seen for an android RPG Diablo type game. Slick graphics, awesome sound track and effects, no slowdown and you can play offline!! Absolutely love the game. Only down side is the worry of repetitivness of the game but i guess only time will tell",
        "Incredible game. Very intuitive and unique with the swipe to cast system. The graphics are quite nice and the amount of memory the game uses is very acceptable for the quality you get. Music is very relaxing and well done. Level and NPC design are great, really feel like I'm playing an old school medieval RPG. Absolutely 0 need to buy gems, the game gives them to you for just killing normal monsters. My only gripe would be to maybe add a fourth class? If not more in future updates. Otherwise, fantastic game, well put together, well written story, great opening scene and whoever did that voice over should be looking to do more! Thank you for making a true RPG for true RPG fans, keep it up!"

Deducting credits may not the good way to discipline afk players. Its good if no one's lose or gain star either win or not. Make it the game not counted so players not waist time to pursue the game. I'll give 5 stars if 5 theres improvement. Thanks!",
        "MOBA with analog is really a big joke. The graphics is trashy. Hero and skin are hard to unlock. There's a kind of in game power up that could be bought with real money. The only reason this game has so many player is the game size & device compatibility. If your phone is capable of playing \"the famous 3v3 moba\", you'd better play that game",
        "I love this game, I've been playing this for over a year and I still play it daily! All the skins and heroes skills are amazing. But please don't  let me team up with low level players it's affecting my game and stats when I'm trying my best to carry they would just afk which can be frustrating. But overall it's a good game",
        "I hv been playing this game for two years alll good perfect game perfect graphics..bt there should be some changes for the afk players... strict steps should be taken towards for these afk players not bye lowering credit score by banning from game for a period of time so that they won't be spoiling game any further",
        "I love the game and everything about it, but however there is a issue which I get reported for and lose credit because of it.   The game client keeps restarting itself whenever I find a match, leaving other players to report me thinking i'm AFK or DC'D  I've gotten alot of Penalty messages and lost credit because of it, I also can't play a single game because the client keeps restarting!  Please do Fix",

All in all this is a fantastic game, I wholeheartedly love it. C:",

Other than that, the ads are subtle and unobtrusive, the bonuses reasonably helpful for the cost, and the shop is nice (but unnecessary! You can enjoy the game without it. )",
        "Ads, ads and more ads. Rated family friendly but ads include electric cigarettes and lottery. Not exactly family friendly. The game is based on tapping to gain hearts to buy things to gain more hearts. Neat except it's nearly impossible to avoid the ads, which seem to be nothing but electric cigarettes and lottery ads (more than 6/10). Even when you're trying to play without ads, you will inevitably tap one of those inspirational messages from one of the animals or plants and launch an ad.",

Where I could write thoughts down or a gratitude journal where you write 3 good things that happen today and you could double your hearts. It would help level up the land faster and for people that are using this as a pick me up app. It would help us put our thoughts down all in the same place. :)",

Second if u have money in millions, the cost of the parts are also in million and so on, and even having millions of dollars in the game u might fail to upgrade vehicle sometimes  that makes no sense.",

It sucks because I have to complete as much of the game as possible in a certain amount of time and that kills the fun. I can't just enjoy it and play a bit then carry on playing a bit later.. please fix this I really enjoy.this game and its getting ruined a bit for me...",

When i searched on google for any helping contact email id or website, there is no email for help.  So tell me,  what should I do? Either solve my problem or i am going to file a case against you. Contact me as soon as possible.",

I feel happy and relef when I complete the game and go on that ship. I think there will be a helicopter because in start there is a helicopter. But nevermind awesome game. Make part 3. Bye..... And I read there is hidden kits? What is this. Why I don't read it before. I can't find any kit. But what is kit? Nevermind I completed the game. One more time. Awesome game. Bye.....",

Now the game doesnt function when you try to start a run and the problem even persisted to my home screen before I closed the application."

EDIT: I was too quick to judge the alternative way to be wrong. Thank you Bart, for your response. I retried what you said and had no trouble finishing the game. Can't wait to see the next game. You have a beautiful mind. These things you create, are a work of art.",
        "Not a bad game by any means, but the \"meh\" rating is due to how short the game is. You'll download it, play it for a bit, and then it'll suddenly be over. I didn't mind that some of the puzzles were too easy, while others seemed a bit too vague (nearly forcing a hint), but what I did mind was how few puzzles there were. 50 puzzles doesn't sound too small a number until you realize over half the puzzles are completed idly in a few seconds.",
        "Brilliant follow-up to YELLOW! ACCEPT NO SUBSTITUTES! And, there ARE games trying to pretend that they're the same...only Bart Bonte does it right!  I try not to let myself do too many levels at once, just so I can extend the game. I can't wait for the next color!",
        "This game and yellow have single handedly improved my relationship with my niece. She loves playing these games over and over every time she comes to visit. Christmas day she didn't want to play with her gifts, she just wanted to sit with me and play yellow. It means so much to me. Thank you for making these games.",
        "By far one of the best puzzle creators for Android games! I was hoping for another \"Yellow 2\", and changing the color really surprised me, Looking forward to... Blue? (PS: after playing for a while, All I see is orange :P)",
        "Bart Bonte is a genius! If I see his name, I know I will love it. I just finished this one tonight and I loved every minute. I only needed the clues for the very last level because I'm familiar with Bart's mind by now. &lt;3 I think it's great that clues are available though and that they don't give everything away right away. It's a big bummer when that happens on other games. Love, your die-hard fan! Please make another one soon!"

        "EA please keep improving, i already in love playing this game until i realized that i had to spend a lot amount of money to upgrade my team and collecting great cards.. actually im not feeling good at this because i'm not a rich guy that could paid all those packs with very high price.. im saying this to represent all f2p players out there, although im not so f2p at all. i only spent a dollar to buy that eoe pass and nothing again until now. so please, give a chance for f2p player to keep playing this game with no jealousy with those high overall p2p players.. thanks",
        "Be careful on this game, its possible to spend real money and get absolutely nothing in return! For example I bought a Saint Patrick pack, 1000 gems a pack and got 10 lucky leafs, I could use the lucky to buy another pack, which I got a lucky leafs from, so I spent 10 lucky leafs got 1 lucky leaf that I couldnt use  unless I brought more! Literally got nothing for my money. This is EAs way of mugging people.",
        "Please add more sounds effect on this game, and fix the sfx that already on this app. I hope you add full match online like the other game (90 minutes) so we just not attack but defends too. Replay button must be great, and i have idea that you guys add event like \"best goal of the week\" or so, from that replay, we can save, and send to you, and you can choose who will win it. I think it will make people playing this game. Commentator should be great too if you add full match versus online. I love this game, please read it. Egy Maulana V plays for Lechia Gdańsk now. Add it! Add to all of your fifa games. That replay button should be great",
        "I just saved up all my team hero points, watched a heap of ads so I could build up stamina so I could do my best to try to get Mané in team heroes. About half way through collecting my hero rewards, the rewards pages started to go blank, and the last 25 packs I opened were empty. Is there any way to correct this?",
        "The game is good but it could be better. Elite players are too expensive  so it's hard to upgrade team. Informs and special cards are all untradable so unless you get lucky in events you won't get a chance to play with them. The new layout is better though. Unless you have plenty of time or money don't expect to progress in this game all that quickly. Mobile games should not be as grindy as console games.",
        "What's wrong with this game. I was playing Vs mode and was in world class level and got more then 600000 fans.and now I saw I'm in pro level.how it could be automaticy.fix it pls what the hell is going on.i make my progress playing v hard and all gone with in movement.even I did not play and lose."

        "Classic tetris with modern graphics, you can use one touch controls or classic directional pad if you wish, both have their own advantage. I am afraid I can't find Bradinsky song. It's okay for me with advisement because EA need something to eat right? Lol",
        "Enjoyed it at first, and short adverts were expected, but recently adverts have become longer, and now last longer than the game. The latest video advert lasted inbetween games lasted 8 mins....ridiculous!!!. I understand the need for adverts, but if you can't play the game, the adverts are pointless, espeacially if it makes players quit.",
        "I just wanted to play Tetris. Happy to pay for it, was hoping I could pay a $5-10 purchase price and then have the game and play it to my liking. No, need to join the T Club (who comes up with this) and pay an ongoing fee. It's TETRIS from the 80s, EA must you milk everything. Nothing is sacred",
        "Great game, but there's an annoying window that pops up everytime I try and start a new marathon. The window is pretty much useless and wastes my time. Would give this 5 stars if it gets patched",
        "Great game and builds on. The original. The only thing stopping it getting the 5* rating is that the ads on it are sometimes several minutes long and at times when they have finished you can't return to the game. I don't mind watching them as I know that's what funds it, but they are putting me off playing now.",
        "Trying to play Tetris with these abysmal touch and swipe controls is an absolute abject mess. Just add some virtual buttons in, since your loot-boxing asses are supposedly so focussed on 'player choice' lately."

        "Easily my favourite android game. Hits all the right spots. While Blitz followed the runner style coins model and see how much you can travel, I am glad that in this game they ditched that over-used android model. I appreciate there vision, it's a complete different game from Blitz. Various fictional cars and characters that seem original inspirations and charming in their own way. The tracks have a theme. Boss races under every championship. There is so much of soul in the game. And you can adjust resolution, add colour correction, adjust many other effects. Words don't do justice here nor does 5/5.",
        "Amazing! I play this game daily and I never got bored. Just one thing: other drivers don't use special abilities which does not makes it challenging. Now since I have completed this game once, I would expect devs to add new levels and characters. I have an idea for a new character. Please contact me if I can help you",
        "The controls take some getting used to. But for a Mario-Kart-like experience for mobile, this game gets my #1 rating. Feels more like Diddy Kong racing to be honest though. Can be played when you only have enough a few minutes, or grinded for awhile until you run out of tickets.",
        "Imagine Mario Kart but on mobile with a few tweaks. That's what this game is and what a great game it is. So much variety and features that makes this game unique. Vector Unit  did an excellent job and this game deserves some credit for how great it is. I'm telling you, if you like Mario Kart, Crash Racing, Sonic All Stars or even Angry Birds Go, you're gonna love this game.",
        "The game just restarted as if I never played it. Just went through the tutorial as a new player. I have been playing for months. Not sure what happened! Can't sync it with google games. I do know I was playing and mid game my phone battery died. I recharged it and went to the game and went default on me.",
        "Second Beach Buggy game, this one you race opponents with some fun, but dirty tricks. A lot of reviews are unfair, just need to figure out strategies. Needs a few new tracks to update it a bit! I cleared it out 4 times & started over, love it! Played everyday for over a year, great fun. Needs a sequel, hope they didn't give up, there is no updates on their site. BBR-2, yea baby!"

        "Ive been playing for a year an some change an my characters the 4 star champions only hav 20 of them an as i progress it gets intense but the game itself cuts back on rewsrds especially the daily grind for 4 star crystal shards. ALSO worth mentioning that a year of playing an i cannot reach max rank on 4 star. Dont mention the 5 star champions. It will take you prob 4 to 5 months of everyday grinding to fully rank a 5 star or even obtain a new one. All the steam aside.  A great game addicting to the  higher levels as you progress",
        "The game is okay, but the drop rates are so suckish. I have opened 10 premium hero crystals  but have not even got a 3 star. My friend, opened his 2nd premium crystal and got a 3 star! Kabam pls like cancel out 2 star heroes in premium hero crystals and like only 3 to 4 or 5 star heroes inside. Oh and u can like gurantee  a 3 star in the 1st premium hero crystal, and also not force people to buy the 2 star hero crystal.",
        "The game is very uncreative. Many of the characters have same moves even when they have different powers... I advice to increase some moves of the players which should be according to their powers otherwise good game.  And also the drop rate is bad, upto this point I have opened about 60 premium crystals and haven't got a single 3 star hero or higher.  .",
        "Pretty repetitive. swipe back, swipe forward, tap tap tap, hold, repeat. controls are rather monotone which I'll slighlty overlook because of the nature of the game but I see a lot of champions have the exact same moveset. also the drop rates are pretty bad. And on arenas, the opponents bcome a lot more powerful than my own. Other than that, good time killer",
        "If you want to invest a ridiculous amount of time to save shards you collect in game to supposedly increase your chances for too quality cards then get yourself either duplicates of what you already have or rubbish class characters in general. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME WITH THIS GAME!",
        "I am addicted to this game. this game is awesome. But the people working in kabam are not good. They have blocked me from sending any messages. First of all I thought it was due to some bugs then I wrote a complaint to kabam. Lately they replied that        I have violated the rules. But I didn't do anything. If I really did anything wrong then they have to send me the proof. with out any proof and information they blocked me. You guys blocked me fine now send me the proof. Prove me that you really know your job. My name in the game is snsnns211187. Send me the proof. With out any proof you should not block me."

Wish there could a 5 second skip button like YouTube does, especially you guys advertise every time after you die/end a game.  The graphics are cool, love the neon colors. It's a game for all ages!!! My kids and my husband and I all play this game. It's very competitive!!! I swear my husband can't beat my score no one has lol",
        "It is soooooo addictive and also VERY awesome. The only problem is that because people go on the game on their phone's or tablets I find it hard to control I don't know if anyone else thinks so but that's my opinion. Pls no hate anyway, Peace out and the reason it is like slither.io is bc it is by the same company",
        "It's good but not what I would play on daily basis..... it's my opinion so don't get mad. The controls are OKAY and I think they add more stuff to the game, I don't have any ideas for it though. This game is great and in the people like it but for me I wouldn't play it all the time on a road trip. Keep up the good work though! 😀😀😀",
        "Great game can be addictive with no real goal but to eat others poop as me and my daughter call it and other worms to grow bigger. Top notch comical game EVER that you wont be able to stop. Only set back is that the game gets extremely extremelylaggy on addroid tablets and on the online game interface",
        "A very addictive game that's great fun! The only problem is with the controls. It seems to go too fast without even hitting the speed button (if you have played it you will know what I mean). IMO the speed function is uneccesary, take it out of the game and it's 5 stars all the way!",
        "Great game however I wish there was a way to avoid the button that makes you speed up suddenly.  This us partially because you use your fingers to maneuver it and your fingers can get in the way of your view of the screen. It could cause you to kind if lose control of your worm."

So far I am in love with the game, still keeping the same format from the original one but adding new food choice and new customer.. Thanks to the developer.. I am really hoping if you guys can come up with the 3rd..",

        "I like this new update. Hanks now have His own happy meter like Tom and Angela. Nice. Also this is just my suggestion. Can you guys also make My Talking Ben and My Talking Ginger. Those two deserved their own My Talking games. Also can you guys add more money to Tom cause He always have just one big gold coin and that's it. You know Angela have plenty of gold coin even Hanks have three. It's not fair. Lastly good job guys.",
        "Great game, probably best talking animal game out for adults n kids... but sometimes u watch a video so u can spin the wheel n win gems or coins but the wheel not always comes up... ive had approx. 20x it has not happened in last 4 hrs... would like it redeemed n fixed plz...",
        "I like my talking tom and I download this one thinking that it will have some fun stuff like play mini games I know this one have a picture feature but man only eat, pet, sleep , and pics? Sorry I am re-downloading my talking Tom and start from scratch that only take pics feed and sleep on this game",
        "My three year old grand daughter got around my password and charged $40 of in app purchases and did a monthly subscription, too. I have gone through everything to try to remedy this, with no help from the customer service from the this apps developer.",
        "I'm only on level 1 wrong so correct me if im wrong but I thought the game was a bit boring at first and the game doesn't seem to give you much choice andyou have to folow what it says but if you enjoy the game thats great! I also did like that u got stickers for taking pics. I did end up having to uninstall the game as it took up to much storage space D: Overall I did really enjoy the game yay =D"

        "Oh boy this way funny! I think my ears are going to burst! XD Anyone who gets it, try playing a song backward or in overlord. IT IS HILARIOUS!!!   You did a great job on the effects, and even when i had the ghost playing the brightest song it sounded creepy. The dragon also made me want to hide as it sounded like it was stomping around as the music blasted through my ears.  Overall, great app. I might be using it on halloween... XD",
        "The app works wonders! The cathedral effect is my favorite (it also makes your voice sound a thousand times better, lol). There are some effects I'm not a big fan of, though, and I think they're not that interesting, such as Poltergeist, Android, Cyborg or Devil. Still, this is the best app for voice effects!",
        "This is the best app! You don't need to talk or to record your own voice in order for this app to change your voice. All you have to do is to type what you want to say and.... That's all! You git my 5 Star, greetings from Philippines",
        "This app is surprisingly a pretty efficient and versatile little gizmo! It has actually quality effects and is super easy to use. I find myself downloading it again and again whenever I need sound stuff, because I keep getting roped into bigger fancier apps that get too complicated and expensive.",
        "I like how you change your voice and record anything like barks, nerf guns, singing and growls. It might be cool if you added a GROWN-UP voice effect you know for kids, plus people who are already grown up could see what they'd sound like double grown-up! PS: Your video \"IS very funny\" No, it wasn't funny, IT WAS HILARIOUS! :D",
        "Nice effects, but Death, Dragon, Evil Puppet etc. All sound very familiar. I think the Death one should have a much more echoey scratchy voice, Dragon should be super loud, superior, scratchy. Same with the fly, shrinking, and small person etc. They all have super squeaky voices  Make them differ And maybe add a girl voice and a man voice so you can just be plain man or plain girl :p Its very good and I like how you can record it, so I can now troll people with the zombie voice."

        "Great game, I like all the references to the show (the maester's tower, the different kingdoms/seats of power, etc.) I think the leige and alliance system is a bit complicated and I think the graphics could use a little work but other than that I really like it.",
        "Major buggs i was at level 16 keep and level 22 had a mishap with binding my account and now i cant get in touch with anyone about the $230 ive spent on this game this month on pack i cant even use now!!!! Aa well as all the glitches that you have to put up with... I try to do research and the times counts down but it wont show as completed although it takes your rss away which is why i bought so many packs i wasted that money just last week!!! Haven't even had time to use the things i bought and now its all gone!!!! I loved the game but i will not continue to play or spend a dime on it until this issue is resolved if i get my money back i will think about not sueing them and play the game again which i dont mind spending money on because it is fun just needs improvement and Google play needs way better customer service!!!!",

        "I Absoulutely love the update! Each design is so unique! I was wondering, will there be mythical animals as legendarys or, as rare. For example The Aura Wolf, an elemental wolf with feathered wings. If you think my idea is silly, I understand! Also, this game is so smooth and fun! It's a must play! I play it everytime I am stressed or need some fun. Anyway I hope you like my idea, if not it's tottal fine! Keep up on the good work and awesome games! Best of Luck for the future!",
        "Its a pretty good game, the animals look nice, but you should definitely add more if them, like tigers, lions and bears (see what i did there?) And add their appropriate habitats. Another thing i saw was all the juveniles are called cubs. This, i think, should be changed. Wolves have pups, foxes have kits, and lynxes have cubs. There should also ve more diversity and variety in the prey department. Such as bison or elk. Over all i really like the game.",
        "I love it all the other animal games were never as good as this one I love how we can have more than two cubs and we can switch between animals. So I rate it 5 stars 😸 love the game and I would recommend it. But the one problem is that it is so hard to get acorns can you make another way to get acorns . Oh and can you add more animals like tiger🐅.",
        "This is one of the best animal rpg games I've ever played. The only thing I'm confused about is how to get a pup. Both of my wolves are above level 10. The female is level 12 and the male is level 11. I made them fall asleep in the den, but I'm not getting a pup. Could you explain this to me? I'll enjoy the game a lot more if you do.",
        "This is the best game I have ever played and ever will play. I recommend it to everyone. Even if it doesn't look good to you get it its awsome. I think or know you will like it. Also it's so cute and the graphics are awsome. Also everything is priced so well. I love how you add new stuff often. Also you can level up fast, and let go of your purse into a new family.

        "Lost another These constant updates caused me to uninstall this. Fun game - very good game!But if it ain't broke don't fix it. I will not sacrifice all the other good games I have for this single one. Now with google only allowing so many apps ( no writing to sd card). Atleast if you update you should let people keep playing with version they have. Make updates optional.",
        "I am not able to play with my friends in custom mode. We are a group of 11 & we want to play together in custom mode by creating our own room. But My 4 friends have IOS devices & their Servers are showing different than us. I don't know why? We can't even connect by number also. Tried doing that!. Please let me know its fixture",
        "It's a fun game. If you're a COD player you'll love it. In general It does good on it's own as a solid shooter. Only thing I think you really, REALLY need to change is the way to get weapons. Using rentals is great, picking up enemy or ally weapons, sure, but having to spend money to get most weapons, if not all, seems a little unfair. It's good that there's a grind to get them but I think it's a little overkill how difficult it is. I think levels should determine what you unlock, then use silver (make it easier to get) to purchase it. Or, if players want to speed up the process, use gold.",
        "I really like the game. Fun, exciting, and addictive. The only problem I have is that the rewards you get are not nearly enough as I think they should be. Exp gains are good, but cash gains are so bad and you will have to play for hours to accumulate cash and then you can buy HALF of a weapon, because they require a lot of cash to get one. You also can barely upgrade weapons without any gold and you can just forget about that unless you put some real world currency in this game, which is a real shame. As a player I know we would like to buy and upgrade our own weapons instead of having to \"rent\" which is an option in the game.",
        "this game is great, but i rated 3 star cuz i wanted this gaem to be like COD: WWII, and like ravenfield. There are NO MG nests, no war modes like COD:WWII, and please, fix the prices! It took me 3 years of full gameplay, 5 hours just to get a shotgun. And please optimize the guns. Overall, really great game!

Play something else and yea a FREAKING TANK IN A MAP THIS SMALL. like were you under the influence of some substances when you made this game. Wast of time. Dont download this abomination."

        "Pretty good, would like a little better graphics though, and sometimes when I go to hold it registers as a tap. Maybe it's just my phone. Also I'm not sure how close it is to the PC version (scale and such) and would like it closer. But I know its hard on a phone screen. Maybe if you made the rotation horizon, you can match the PC layout more (with the different sized boards that the PC version has)",
        "I like the app in all, but I have some points I would like the developer to take into consideration. When a new game starts, it would be better to start with the \"mine\" option on and not the flag (so that you can open a new tile and not set a flag randomly), even if the flag was the last option used in the previous round. I also believe that in hard mode the game is made too random and not that skill-demanding. Other than these points it's nicely done!",
        "I love that this game has been ported so smoothly to the phone. The most interesting part of this game is the ads, or rather, the option of ads. In since this game is free it includes ads, but you can turn them of, or change the kind of ad that you get. For this reason, i actually had the ads on, because i think the developer deserves the money he/she gets from choosing such a great system. Sadly i cannot speak for everyone. Good game.",
        "Overall the app is really great. It's the same concept as the original PC version with just some slight changes to make it work for a touch screen. The only downside is that since you're not playing with a mouse you have to click a button at the top of the screen every time you want to switch between planting flags or revealing spaces vs using the right or left mouse buttons. But I see no way around this on a smart phone or tablet. Also, there are very minimal ads, which is awesome.",
        "Input delays keep getting me killed. Instead of marking a bomb my input sets it off. I'd prefer two different inputs for marking or removing tiles.  I'm using a stylus too so I know it's not an issue of accidentally hitting the wrong tile.",
        "Great game. Love it! Sometimes the flag wouldn't place when you pressed a square, and once it selected a square instead of placing a flag, but I still really liked it. Wish there was a zoom because the mini square field is a ton of fun, but a bit small for my fingers. I still love the game though!"

If I bet big, I lose. Time to buy more fake money. I'll play people with the same profile picture but with different stats. Weird. Buyer beware.",
        "Don't care for the fact you have to invite friends from FB NOW and they have to start playing in order to receive points. I wont ever go into my own wallet in order to play a game . Never have and i dont believe these games should ask you to do so to keep playing their game...bad customer service.. buy them if you dont want constant ads or something like that, but not to play a game.",
        "How can you win when you're dealt crappy cards every deal and then you run out of money,  conveniently 10 seconds before the end of the game. But you can purchase more coins!!!! Ridiculous!!!"

The developer should cap the high score at the number that is literally the highest possible score (based on the size of the board)",

When i was building on that high score, the screen glitched and swiped a number of times, ruining the order of the numbers. This has happened on multiple occasions only in this app. It's not such a big problem for people that are newer, but when you've got big numbers, such as 8192, it makes the game unplayable."

Update few days later...   Suddenly the game keeps crashing randomly...   Tried it for days....   Can hardly survive a single level now...    Very sad....   The game itself is still excellent....   Maybe a later update brings a fix..................",
        "This is by far one of the best games I have played like this all year. Very addicting, easy, but challenging enough to keep you wanting to come back play some more. Haven't found something I don't like about this game just yet😁",
        "Fun game, my daughter enjoys playing. ..easy, yet challenging at the same time.  One irritating issue...every time there's an update, or just opening the app, turns on the game's notifications..and have to turn it off constantly. ..otherwise it would be a rare 5 star rating from me.",
        "You can't get anywhere unless you actually use money to buy the power ups to bet the levels. It's a waste of space for any device",
        "Hate it. Too difficult. No helping aid. Not funny, but stressful. I left the game at level 83. Why you made it ugly like this?",
        "Like with all other games this game is rigged, once you get to a certain level you are set up to fail unless you buy coins. I don't play games so I can go broke on coins, I don't like this."

        "This is a very well thought out game and I love the positive comments when I finally figure out the  way I need to go first so that the next shot is easier to get. Some of these shots are really difficult, if you don't get the right basket first. Anyway, I love the challenge. Y'all got my vote. BEST GAME EVER. Thanks man. I love your guys' creativity.",
        "This game was good  but could be better. I wish there was something other than just basketball. Like tennis, football, or something like that. Graphics were good. This game is addicting but it's hard to get past level 20 if you don't have Facebook. So I'm stuck on trying to get enough stars to get through. Good but could be better",
        "Had to lower my stars. You have to use all the retry and balls a couple times just to figure out levels. Then u play 1 level and u wait for more energy. Same ole money app pay to play. Was ok until higher levels. Now it drives me crazy. Good game though just can't play it much.",
        "This game is fun, but it seems like there are tons of attempts to get you to buy stuff. Plus you can't get Panda as a character. But other than that this game is awesome. I don't know why on the Dude Perfect channel they advertise it as just for iPhone, but at the very end say it is also available for Android. I recommend this game. It is very fun",
        "Firstly to John J - I have never paid a cent to play this game and that is why I love this game!! I have been able to complete the whole game 210 levels without paying a dime! That's truly awesome! It has been challenging because in order to advance I needed to get 3 stars on all levels to open up the next level for free. Then of course you have the energy bar that runs out, but that's ok because it replenishes in reasonable time. I would run out and instead of paying money I would go check an email, or post on Facebook and before too long I'm back playing a few more shots on dude perfect 2!! So easy, so cheap, so challenging and so much fun and so friggin awesome when you completed level in 3 stars!! I can't wait till the next section opens to see what they have in store for us. Thanks.",
        "Would be better if you could do everything without Facebook cos that sorta limits options for some people. Also could you please get rid of the energy bar? That makes things hard. But like that you put your actual voice in it."

        "Extremely addictive! First day I played I overshot my bus stop by 5 minutes because I forgot to look up.  There is always something to do in the game somewhere - and the micro transaction bit doesn't feel forced, and you can easily progress without it.  It kept me occupied for days - unfortunately I had to delete it because I got too caught up.  So if you're looking for a game to grab your attention and keep you entertained on long commutes and the like, this is great for that",
        "Fun little game, but I would love for food, and water, to be a little bit faster. Also maybe rise up the rush chances. I do have 1 suggestion, maybe when the people off to the Waste Lands, they can find some rare stuff, like gems or maybe clothes/weapons. This game is really fun, even though I've just started it, keep up the great work! 👍🏽",
        "I figured my old ass phone wouldnt run this game when first announced, just confirming for folks it sure doesnt. I thought there might be a chance it would cos my phone is rooted and I have full control over how my ram is utilized. Thank bob for android emulators on desktop, can't wait to play :)",
        "Look, I can kind of understand dwellers not dropping their assignments to fight raiders, but can we have the ability to assign fighters to the raiders themselves. It's a massive and unnecessary pain to constantly remind my few armed dwellers to actually fight the raiders instead of just looking cute in the room they just left. Weapons are scarce in this game, and raiders move too often to play pass the gun. It would also be nice if there was a pause feature, but that would reduce the butler-bot purchases.",
        "Fantastic! A resource management sim that is incredibly fresh and charming thanks to the richness of the Fallout franchise. Keeps you coming back for hours. From the quirkiness of the dwellers to the depth of the side quest system, this game is deserving of your time. Finally, the game is totally playable without paying. Still, throw the devs a few bucks! You'll sink hours into this title.",
        "Absolutely love this game. If you're a die hard fallout fan, or even someone new to the series this is the perfect game for you. You'll get a sense of nostalgia pulling your first legendary dweller, or a sigh of relief when you obtain that last part for the weapon you've been looking to craft. Fallout Shelter is the perfect mobile game for any fan of the series. The game is slow and hard in the beginning but when you get on your feet you'll never want to put it down. If you're on the edge about downloading it please do, it's worth all the time and space!"

        "Literally unplayable. Game pauses itself in the middle of races multiple times. I am nowhere near touching the paise button and even went as far as to place my phone on the ground and touch the phone with only one finger on the accelerate button. SOMEHOW the game pauses itself 7 times during that race. Uninstalling.",
        "It is fun and challenging. Had it on my last phone and it often glitched during races which basically ruins that race. Downloaded it on my new phone which is much more powerful, thinking it would be fine, but it glitches in the same way and with the same frequency. It would be really nice if they could \"ditch the glitch\" so to speak. Thanks",
        "So hard to beat the game. I'm not gonna say anything except it is PAY TO WIN. No rewards, you have to spend real money to beat your NOVICE rival, yup you read it right, novice. So freaking hard to beat the actual scripted AI. And you can't buy anything in shop without real money.",
        "Love the game, play everyday esp the jam tracks. Controls are very inconsistent. Seems like you are limited to how fast you can go. When  it appears you about to better your time you lose control of your bike..sick of the glitches and feels like i have to pay to win",
        "Been playing for a few years and about to quit because every time I have a lead my bike goes forward by itself and starts glitching. Almost feels like I'm being cheated out of a good run. Maybe it's because I don't pay to play. Please fix or I'm deleting!",
        "The one thing that wrecks the game for me is the little hangup glitches that happen constantly.  You need to be precise to win races, and it's pretty hard to do that when the game is always stuttering.  Running on a brand new MotoZ2 Play, btw."

Because of slow loading it will kill your battery life fast as well. Please help to fix the problem and I will re-rate again. Thanks",

There were only one pair of cards with two dots and they overlapped each other, which of course I could not pair them up. And there were three pairs of one strip appeared.",
        "It would be better if there were more tile choices, besides the basic 3. What really annoys me is that if you pause for a few seconds to look up or think of a move, an ad pops up. A 30 second, non skipable ad. The ads are also there after you finish every match. I know you need to make revenue but jeez. Calm down."

I thought it was my bad driving but it seems I'm not the only one who disliked this game.so  please make some improvements. I could drag you through all the bad things but I won't make you suffer. So I will give it sadly a 👎.",
        "The game is ok at least when I get a chance to play it -there are way too many ads every time i click on a level to play an ad shows up even sometimes during when i play an ad shows up. I strongly recommend that you do not install this app",
        "WAY too many ads.  play 30 seconds, then watch a one minute ad.  Dont really know if i would like the game or not, i never got to play much of it, spent most of my time watching and trying to closeout ads.",
        "First if all... Its down right BORING! Also there is adds after every single level! Sometimes the adds are weird and innaproprete! I do NOT reccomend this game, download at your own risk😕",
        "I liked the game and all but there were way to many ads. Every level there was a thirty second video playing and some of them were extremely inappropriate. I got a bit impatient waiting for all the ads to end but I liked the game set-up. I think that was a neat idea. I just think it would be better without all the interruptions",
        "I think it should be a bit more realistic and by that I mean more people on the streets; if you crash into someone, that person would come out of their car angry and cars get damaged when you crash into them. Maybe, to add a bit more reality to the game, you could add the money that they pay you to the levels. Apart from that it is an excellent game. However, some people, when they get in a taxi, chat away to the taxi driver."

        "Edit: Fix the controls! Under the default setting the gas would randomly stop working, and while using auto accelerate the nitro randomly activates even when my thumbs are nowhere near them!  Runs smooth and looks great for a retro style racer.  I wish more devs would release games like this, the free game isn't so much a demo as it is a kind of shareware like they released in the 90s.",
        "Lack of game play is what gets me. Don't get me wrong, it's a smart tactic. Offer a free game with *just* enough content to get you hooked then push a \"pay for\" ad to keep playing the rest of the game. May as well call it a trial or a demo mode, that's all it is. Which it's a shame, I'd rather watch a couple ads here and there vs that tactic.",
        "So I downloaded and wound up buying the full version about 6 months ago. Was awesome. Outrun meets Cruisin USA. Loved it, beat it, 80% through trying to get perfect on every course to unlock a different ending mostly just because I want to keep playing and then it updates. Way after I purchased, a whole brand new set of course tracks. It's the best pocket change you'll ever spend.",
        "It was a good game. Too bad it doesnt open now after the update. It says something below the logo screen and then dissapears too fast you cant read it. And when it goes to the gear connecting thing to try to connect it crashes.",
        "Can you guys pls fix the game because when I started to play then while its loading THE GAME GOT CRASH! The oldest version work for me but this version it didn't work. Thx to read this.",
        "It's a great game, it has good graphics and awesome cars. But one thing that I don't get after I have downloaded it why do I still need to purchase it.... really that's not cool....if people found out about this they may end up uninstalling the app....if only you could give it to me for free."

        "Candy crush is an Awesome addicting Game, Same with soda. Jelly is fun, BUT!, It is the most cheating game I have ever played. The AI will always take advantage of beating you with moves that will take what you need 98% of the time. Moves that no one can see but magically the AI knows what to choose to beat you. I love strategy games, but cheating is not a fun for anyone. The AI compition is not a compition. It's a slaghter waste of time until you get lucky or they give it too you. No strategy there. Just piss you off cheating AI. Being the top of Candy Crush and Candy crush soda. And yes also Jelly. It is ridiculous sometimes to waste my time with this one. If the AI opponents played at the highest level of what to use, then I wouldn't mind getting beaten. But when you watch the AI make the dumbest move to get what it needed, tells you that the AI sees the whole board. Even what is hidden. Give up or beat yourself up on this one. I seem to love the Gluten of punishment, lol.",
        "Candy crush, soda crush, & candy crush jellies cuts off for no apparent reason while in gameplay. The game has done that on 4 different devices.",
        "Constantly crashes and freezes taking everything I have away. I took a screenshot but of course I can't post it because it would prove the game doesn't work",
        "TOP GROSSING!?! YES OF COURSE, bc WE'RE ALL STUPID! I'm playin a level w/ the Monklings, like 124/6 if u watch closely if u catch a long, 6,7,8, row on Monklings KING WILL NOT ALLOW U TO HAVE THE WHOLE row. Watch the number counter not the monklings going under the rope & u will see the counter not go pass a certain number! THE SAME NUMBER continues like 6 will stay 6 4x's! That way u don't beat the level & u have to buy a booster, KING Co are CHEATS!",
        "I love this game a lot. In fact, I like all of the candy crush games. But when will the show come back? Also, when can we play against the Jelly Queen again?"

Very quickly i can tell you that much in my first try at a different approach.",
        "Does not hardly ever match with the amount you are betting so if you are betting 500,000 you will hardly ever match it or win over the amount so the small bets suck and do not equil to the amount you are winning. Sure you will hit some big wins but watch your winning amounts and see it dwindle slowly.   Winnings are fast at first but slows way down. I use max bet when testing slot games and this one takes your winnings just as fast as you get them.  Also u have to follow there story line and you start off with just one game that you have to play for 10 levels and a new game opens and that is every 10 levels.  So at level 100 you only have 10 games to choose.",
        "This game is at most decent. The biggest issue I face in the game are the symbols. The power up stars to help you level up, the scatter symbols and the bonus symbols only get in the way making it very difficult to get good line hits. Not to mention most of the slots pay very poorly. The bonus games are unique but very difficult to get and pay poorly. The free games are very boring with no real motives to get excited to get them, also poor payouts. You can't make an account and not save progress. The Artemis slot and Hestia slot NEED AN UPGRADE, two very promising slots are ruined do to the fact that the scatter and star symbols all get in the way. PLEASE get rid of the damn stars And make free games obtainable in a different way. I can not tell you enough how many times Iv almost had a good 5 of a kind when all of a sudden the star or scatter symbols get in the way. The hourly free coins are decent and the daily free spin for coins is ok. There are also it's good side to this game. Like I mentioned before the bonus games are unique and fun and the graphics are great. The slots offer a few ways helping you to gain a good win and achieveable quests to help you gain more coins and level up faster. This games has much promise to it and because it is sill an early game I think I will continue to play it in hopes that the creators can update this to be a fantastic game",
        "I like these  game a lot it,s hard to quit them once you start playing. The bonus are really cool. That,s the must exciting thing about the games.I think.?"

        "I love this game up until it asked me for a loan for one of the characters for 250 gems that i purchased. I contact Tech support and nothing is being done. After this last update I lost slot. It started off awesome but once I started investing money in the game it's like it just took my money by taking the gifts and coins.  Such a waste of time and money when no corrections are made.  Trying to give the developer a chance to redeem themselves from this error.",
        "I like the idea of changing prices and finding new recipes. I want the barista to automatically start the machines if there isn't one already there. i want to be able to hire another barista. I want to put my menu on the other wall. I want smaller windows. There's basically a lot of things i feel limited on and i still haven't figured out if i can change the color on wallpaper or not.",
        "I watched the 4 adverts and got a no diamonds for the doing so. I also watched the the add to pick a bonus prize, never got a that either. I used to play this game a lot and I've noticed the prices of everything have went up and including the spices. You no longer have the option to buy the cheaper furniture forcing you to spend more so customers come in to the Cafe. Very greedy and game makers. Sort these issues and give me the diamonds I'm owed or take away the ads.",
        "I'm used to like this game very much, addicting and lovely although it is so p2w. After certain update my game will start to reverse progress itself when one message pop out and state \"profile change, please restart\". Recently this problem occur very frequent and its so unbearable and irritating when what u done it just become undone, ALWAYS.  Im so fed up with this and quit for few days, wish developer can fix or lessen this issues or i will just uninstall it one day, thanks for reading.",
        "In the world of cafe games this one is a gem that stands out like a diamond in the rough. Fun and easy to play, it's set at a relaxing pace with you learning new recipes and chatting with your customers. Who are all really interesting people with unique storylines....I think one of them is trying to steal the Mona Lisa,lol.",
        "Fix the controls! Atleast have an option to enable and disable the editing of the layout or location of the items in-game. Such a pain that God-forbid you touched an item for a half a second too long it will prompt you to move, delete or put that item in storage."

        "Great game and graphics. Need to work on the optimization though as constant crashes occurs. Will also be thrilled to see rework on Yomo as he looks really plain in this game. Character collision and ability lock in also needs improvement, especially those with dashes which will be better to have single target lock in. Overall as a TG fan I love this game.",
        "The game is absolutely amazing ^^ This is definitely one of the better start up games in the app store. I would love to see more improvement with the graphics, load time, and effects. I can't wait to see the characters that will be added next. If I may I'd like to suggest that everyone's eyeball fascinated mask maker be added. Uta is definitely one of my favorite characters and it's a shame Yomo was implemented but not Uta. Many wishes for this game ^^",
        "A good graphics for a good beginning franchise. A well tame game for an anime base. But my concerns on playing this game is sometimes ita forcing crash. (I thought this was a high end game so basically you need a good phone that can handle a game like this) im looking forward for better improvements such as more charcaters to come. And much more sfx. Big thumbs up for this game.",
        "I have been waiting for someone to make a Tokyo ghoul game now here it is. What can I say about this game other then its awesome I love it , but I do wish they would add more characters and maybe add some from the Tokyo ghoul re manga but anyways awesome game. Now someone needs to make a my hero academia game then a one piece game and I'll be happy.",
        "Had been really enjoying this game despite the consistent crashes.  Now; however, the game won't even start.  It stays stuck on the beginning loading screen.  Please fix and I will update my review.  EDIT:  issue fixed.  Looks like it was maintenance they didn't bother announcing until after the fact.  Love the game so still 5 stars but would be nice to have to some advance notice with these things.",
        "Ok, as fun as this game is, it has a lot of problems. Severe lagging during missions and crashing, just to name the few. On top of that, lately I can't even start up the game, cuz I get stack on the loading screen before I can even log in into the server. Very disappointed. There's hoping the devs will fix that issue soon, since this game shows a lot of potential."

        "This game is good, could use some improvements. I love how you can actually win good amount of coins regularly. Tap the chest on the reels and get millions is a plus. Most games only give a few thousand. I think new things could get added like tournaments, clubs, chats, special events, things to keep people interested. It gets boring after the first day.",
        "Thank you for creating a game that is actually fun!!  The payouts are excellent!  This is the best slot game that I have played and I have been through quite a few!  The only thing that could make this game even better is to make clubs so we can talk to team mates!  Please do not change the win/loose ratio like all other slots have done.  I have recommended your game to everyone I know with positive comments from all!",
        "Played a lot of these games and this is the best by far. Love it Don't waste your time with any other game. The pay outs are frequent and sizeable. I've been playing max bets for ever and I'm sitting with 6.5 trillion in credits. That's right ......thats trillions. Best slots",
        "This is a very entertaining game. Great graphics,great returns. No complaints, plenty of plaudits. This is the second time I've written a comment. Do you feel insecure? Do you need me to write a second review? I stand by my original comment. Please don't ask me to write a third review, it takes me away from the game!",
        "Awesome payouts! Frequent wins. Great graphics only down fall is it takes awhile to level up which gets boring also would rather be able to bet higher make it more risk taking cheers"

Also, why does the Apple version have stars and the android version doesn't? I was trying so hard to earn enough stars to buy the colour packs on my iPod, and I got quite disappointed that I can't do that on android. I guess I'll just delete the game off android since there's really no goal to the game now.",

Quiet whinning about ads. Someonbe has to pay the creators for this game including the upkeep and updates. How else will the creator make his money? 2 choices, either gets ads or charge to download. So I can deal with the ads. It's a FREE APP.",
        "Way too many ads. I just need something for my fingers to do while listening to podcasts but this constantly interrupts my listening pretty much after every round. I really liked the game but I have had it with thw ads and am uninstalling. It's just not worth it.",
        "I really like the game but as many others have said their are too many ads. Ads after every round and sometimes in the middle of the round which makes you start over and that gets annoying. Too many of thr same ads. I also agree their needs to be a redo button. It does get a bit pintle after you hit the goal but still fun.",
        "Too many adds, and it makes me restart every time an add plays, I've only had this app for 1 min, and have already played 50 rounds... Not. Cool. I would be okay with the adds if I could at least pick up on where I last left off.",
        "I'm not quite sure what's happened to this game. It's very straightforward and strangely addictive. However, just today after Android's OS update, it performs much worse. Where before when you pick up a block, it is elevated slightly above your finger so you can see where it's going, now it's just under your finger, making this game frustratingly impossible. If this is due to an interaction with the OS update, then 1010 is due for it's own update."

        "Was more enjoyable to play before the update. Before I could move items I bought now everything I buy ends up in upper left corner. Cannot really even see each item. I basically watch each time a purchase is made to see the stars before moving on.  Also agree the game was easier but now is much harder and takes longer to open treasure chest.",
        "Can't create your own tanks,  things just get placed there and you can't move them. The game itself is okay,  but if you take more than two seconds to find a move you want to do,  it starts flashing a move hint,  and not the best move either.  Nothing different to make this game stand out from most match three games.",
        "Only played until level 8. It's an okay game but you can't really decorate your reef. You buy items and they plop down but you can't move them, so they stay where they fell. Not impressed. Used to play Fishdom and it was SO much better. The graphics were better and you could really decorate your tanks by moving items to where you wanted them not where they plopped down. You could also rename your fish. This game is like expecting Oreos and getting generic, chocolate sandwich cookies. Just a cheap imitation. Uninstalling",
        "I would give it a 5 IF it had some instructions.  How do you choose a picture for the character frame?  I choose a house for my tank and it didn't show up.  I checked out all of the icons and couldn't find any help.  I really don't want to delete game but I would like some help, and I see that other players would too.  Thanks.",
        "Only wasted my time for a few levels then got rid of this pretty quick! Why waste your time completing levels, earning coins to buy stuff to decorate  when whatever you buy just gets a ll plopped down in one spot and cannot be moved. That's NOT decorating!!!! Fix that and I may be back.",
        "The game is listed as Everyone, but it is likely up to age 10. Helping fish friends? No, even less than 10. Dont understand why the game occupies 123 Mb of space, that is over the average."

        "I love this game! Its BEYOND ADDICTIVE! There is no Methadone to cure or lure one away from the graphics, variety of bonus games or ever changing levels that erase reality and become the Pied Piper as its classical music lures one into its universe of gaming. This is a \"slot,\" which appeals to those who also enjoy a nether-universe of of scifi/fantasu. Its visually appealing, as well as, fun!!!! An AWESOME SITE!!!",
        "Yes it looks and sounds amazing. But short of that, this slot game is completely unremarkable. Just like every other slot game out there, wins are few and far between. The hourly bonus is weak aswel. When you're at a level that requires you to max bet (25000000 or more) and you win 1000000 on the hour bonus and have nothing in the credit meter due to the lack of free spins and no bonuses, it becomes very frustrating. Install if you're easily entertained by graphics and sound, because thats seriously the only thing you will get from this.",
        "THE PLOTS(NOT SLOTS,LOL)ARE THE BEST ,GRAPHICS ARE GREAT AND YOUR NOT JUST PLAYONG A SLOT,YOU ARE REALLY IN TO THE GAMES!!!!! I HAVE TO SAY IT JUST GETS BETTER AND MORE INVOLVED THE MORE YOU PLAY. THANK YOU.10+!It just gets better and better!!!!! Love it more and more!! thanks again THEY KEEP ME  EAGER TO GET TO THE NEXT ROUND OF  PLAY.   KEEP  THEM COMING. THANK YOU",
        "Used to be fun and worth maybe occasionally spending a few bucks on. Now early levels easier but struggle to ever get past first 3 levels. Seems to be just about getting you to spend real money now. Better have your big boy wallet or not worth installing. Really too bad.",
        "This is the best online slots game ever.  This game has so many awesome graphics and great prizes for everyone playing.  Thanks Murka for keeping for the last 2 years of  my sleeplessness nights soooo very interesting!!!!!  Luv ya bunches....waiting for more to come.....",
        "I love the graphics and the slot games, I really enjoy playing, but by level 70 some of the missions are just completely ridiculously high and for me that takes away some of the enjoyment, eg. Spin 700 times on max bet - that is just too much. How about give more variety of challenges rather than making them too hard to achieve or too long winded."

        "The graphic are great and the gameplay is fun but what kept me going was the writing. At first I was like uhhh another newspaper? Those don't do anything... But I kept reading and they are GREAT. On the lower side, the drones often clip in building and can't be clicked or you click straight on it but get sent to a building screen instead and by the time you get back, the fast drones are gone.",
        "Soul eggs are incredibly buggy. On the higher level eggs you can go from earning 10s a sec to 1 a sec just by closing the app. The extra soul eggs through epic research when you prestige isn't clear enough and doesn't match the description. Later game is very much about waiting for a counter to hit one billion which means you don't need to open the app all that much. Other than that, it's ok.",
        "Very good game overall, relaxing and good to play if you have a short period of free time. The only thing I would say is I wish opening the piggy bank didn't cost REAL money because I have thousands of golden eggs in it but I can't get them out because I don't want to spend money. Maybe make it that you have to spend TONS of the in-game money to open it. I would rate this 4/5 stars, as I thoroughly enjoy it.",
        "Great stuff, cool graphics and awesome story writing. A nice time passing game. Would have given 5 stars if a little more improvement was made. Bug - When you tap on the box when it is being thrown by the courier van, the dialog shifts up to the to of the screen, overlapping the cash counter. Suggestion - The whole farm area should be easily scrollable. Also, you could put in an option to zoom out to fit the whole farm on the screen.",
        "I play the game all the time, but it needs easier and faster prestige. Three days of waiting for the next egg is bs with a prestige score of almost 1,000,000. Also \"silos\" hardly earn anything. That's my main complaint. Fix it so they earn WAY more over non play or I'm done and I've actually spent money so if you still want that, fix it.",
        "Fun and simple game that lets you gradually grow your farm at your own speed. This is a game you can play from once a week where you collect the money you've collected offline, buy upgrades, then leave the game for another week; to spending a few casual hours of hunting for the drones that give you extra money and gold eggs which are the games micro-transaction currency to buy permanent upgrades that help your farm grow faster. It not so much a race as it is just enjoying your farm steadily grow over time."

        "I love it! Out of all the 4 versions my favorite is this one. And it does say 12+ but it really isn't that bad once you get use to it. I just learned to play these games a month ago and trust me you see a pattern of where they go. I haven't played it one night. But then again I have never been jump scared. And parents if your kid is 9 or 10 and they want this game I say go ahead and say yes! One of the best games ever!",
        "It would be better if.... If you would be able to play MORE THAT ONE NIGHT. And when I used the flashlight I had to tap on the area a good few times before it actually worked. And no I don't have a problem with my screen.  I love the PC version of both the games, one of the best horror games in years. I'll definitely buy it IF reaction time on the flashlight would improve. I love the storyline and graphics of the game and would recommend it to anyone who is willing to work on night shift at Freddy Fazbear pizzeria.",
        "AWESOME I am in love with the 2nd game! It's scary and addicting because you want to come back for more! Fnaf is my fav game in the world and I make awesome fan art for it. (Instagram: Laughingsealey) I am saving up for the mobile versions of fnaf even tho I have all the PC versions. I love the graphics and the lore in this game! Actually, this is the only horror game I will play. I spend hours coming up with theory's and watching theorists make more theory's. Amazing game and it's worth the money!",
        "Great! Even though this is only the demo, it is amazing. Just playing the demo made me nervous, but despite that I am purchasing the full game. (Luckily) I was able to complete the demo when I played it, so I am a valid advice giver to anyone who tries the demo. My advice: Get the demo. It is great. Another piece of advice is don't waste your battery. I was able to complete the demo with three bars of my battery left. The last piece of advice I'll give is to keep an eye on Bonnie.",
        "Force Close I LOVE THIS GAME MORE THAN ANY LIVING SOUL!! And then it doesn't work!? It's an awesome game and I would never hate, but is there any way that you can fix this? And I was also wondering if u can make the demo free for the first game out as well. Thanks Scott :)",
        "This game is scary for me because purple man jumpscares me a lot and am 9 years old. Scott thanks for making it but I will gave it 5 stars if you put a warning sign that says that there coming. Also if you could make the flashlight with more power and make it go to other nights and hard. But this game is scary and cool"

It's a different take on a Final Fantasy game, and it really does feel like a Dissidia game in RPG form. The bravery and HP system is very interesting, and I'm always looking forward for new characters and their few, but unique, special abilities. TL;DR Overall great game.",
        "My name is auron I've been playing game since release and I have some concerns. For starters I have 999 all strength crystals. Why is there still events to get crystals? And wakka can use some ability to boost his buff dance. He barely procs.maybe instead of strength crystals you can have key events for summon materials... Love this game btw keep up the good work and please rework wakka!!!!",
        "It's liked someone finally thought \"hey,  maybe people just want a classic ff based game with out to much mobile game bull.\" I liking  it so far,  leveling pretty fast(well until  the pay wall hits) and the chance of me spend money on this 70 percent. But for real,  4 chapters in still  no Squall ya killing me.",
        "Absolutely amazing. I can safely call this an actual game that you can play. There is no energy that stupidly limits play time, you can unlock all available characters by playing the game, and it actually FEELS like a true Final Fantasy game! I love this game and I am definitely going to spend money in the future to show my support for this amazing game.   However, since this game is fairly new, there isn't much to do. You definitely need to add more quests, more characters, more events, and PvP. Real-time PvP would be amazing. This is truely a spectacular game, and I highly recommend it for any Final Fantasy fan. Also, Cloud is available near the start of the game! Big thumbs up. Please don't screw around with energy Square Enix, please as it is a plague in the mobile gaming business.   EDIT: Please increase the level cap to 99 in the future please. Lv 50 cap doesn't feel right at all. Otherwise, awesome game.",
        "The game is amazing!! However I am not able to play on my Samsung Galaxy 9+ after upgrading my phone and this is truly unfortunate. Are you guys working on a fix? Pleease let me know, will update to five star after...cause I mean at this point I cant play the game :(.",
        "Got this game since launch, but after the 6th days, the game get pretty repetitive. My cload still at lvl 47 lol. The cutscene video could be better because I always skipped it. The casually walking at the start of a video make me wanna spam the skip button. I remember what intrigued me from the old ff cutscenes wasn't about the graphic, but their action pack scenes. RTK just launched (currently #1 on play store). I'll be playing that game instead for now."

        "Well the game is okay but its so laggy and there is no commentary, its like playing football with no commentary. Pliz add that and then the life regeneration time is too long. Make it 30mins at least. Conteols need improvement and finally the guy run like fellaini. Speed is low it neexs a fix.",

When I'm in career mode it always stops at about 58 seconds in.I have no Internet connection now but why do you need it to watch videos.Guys need to improve the game a bit.Not happy with it😡😔.",
        "The adds killed the game, every time you do anything it's a 30s video and it kills the game. I loved the old games and it hasn't moved on much over the years apart from the new game modes that you have to pay for",
        "Unplayable due to developer greed. Don't mind occasional adverts but one after each match and another before the start of the next is a joke. Spend more time watching ads thank playing game!!!!",

Ads should not pop up during a timed game. Put them after a puzzle is finished. This tells me the game maker cares more about the ads than user experience. I'm sure the company will point out that I can pay to remove the ads. Why would I pay for a game with a limited number of puzzles? Ad revenue should be enough, but ads should not be obtrusive and interfere with game play.",

I've actually stopped my daughter playing it due to words like knife school iraqi dead etc all in one puzzle! Feels almost like a warning!!! Please make some happier puzzles so me and my daughter can play against each other again  And as you say the words are generated but as the GAME OWNER/DESIGNER/PROGRAMMER you can pick words to keep out otherwise it's just a computer game that's generated and you just put your name to it instead of actually putting in the work to design it properly",

        "Great game, great idea. But, when you have even 2 workshops, notification for broken machines are really annoying. Every few minutes a long vibrate which I cant turn off... What is a difference if I buy better worker or he evolve? Maybe to include waiting for raw material after order? Include different sizes of workshops? I have some other ideas as well",
        "This game is really well done. The tutorial teaches you everything you need to know. Its an amazing game and its very fun for killing time. As a machinist my self I like the aspects it puts into play. So good job to the developers its a great game.",
        "What you see is it. Very simple game. Very simple practice. Just s classic build up your base, buy more expensive stuff to make you more money. I don't recommend to download it because of gameplay but because of it's amazing sound track. I LOVE LOVE the techno one that has a very short guitar rift in there. It's music is probably the best for a mobile game and definitely worthy of being a big mainstream soundtrack.  I read some of the reviews. A lot of these people probably aren't smart enough to pour piss out of a boot let alone operate their phone. There is a simple tutorial and even then it's easy to operate. It's not hard to make money like some people it is. Don't spend all your money at once, dumbass.",
        "Irony, factory efficiency game with no automation, zero, none. If you want automation pay $$$. If you want more in game coins pay $$$ so if you cant afford automation and you cant afford currency games done for you. Cant make your own premium currency without paying either. Just a free demo app at this point.",
        "I like the game just wish it was not over priced  There is a machine that will cost me 4000 gold and if i was to buy it cost me 80 bucks real cash to get it with only 1000 left over thats crazy high it be nice to have flash sales that would make more money for the game but also would be nice to have a cash or gold option when buying  The new machines and it be nice if some  Machines you buy will produce gold without spending cash  On the machines that will. lowering the price would be a big plus and a lot more people would be willing to buy cuz my saying is a fast dime is better then a slow Dollar so if they was to lower price they would make a lot more money faster just my opinion and it would be cool if you could do customization to work uniform and do a little bit of customization in the game just my thought on it",
        "Do not use this , within 30 minutes of using i needed to use real money if i wanted to keep contracts going and i was only level 5"

        "Fun game to play. I don't like new high stakes betting. You never win and lose your coins really fast. Don't waste your real money to buy coins because they won't last either. Glad they raised free coins you but now machines don't pay out as often. Have fun with your free coins and this is a good time.",
        "I use to love! this game, it was the one game that did not cheat you out of your coins now the game is red it doesn't stop when you wanted to stop some lines stick together in the game or if you push the game to stop it continues to roll that's cheating that's literally cheating people out of their money now the game sucks I would never buy coins to play this game again. I will only play with the coins this game allow me thank you",
        "I have been enjoying all the different things that are going on while I'm in play. I like that I'm playing for more than just credits!  I'm not just sticking around The same.number of credits...I don't like a lot of the gaming apps out there....they bore me quickly! I keep catching myself saying, \"ok... Just a couple more spins and I'll close it up and get something  done today....\"  Then I'll level up to unlock a new game... And who just closes the app -&gt;before at least checking it out first, Right? (kinda like hitting a baseball out of the park and walking over to the concession stands to buy some nachos before running the bases in Victory!) graphics are clear! Bonuses are fun! Good Job on putting together A Fantastic Gaming App!",
        "I just began playing Pharaoh's way tonight, I love everything about it except the two times it tried to show me some special things that are going on in the game, it freezes up and won't let me play until I completely shut it down and reboot the app. I hope you can resolve this problem! If you can, it'll be a next to perfect gaming app!",
        "Its coo!! Luv luv it! Arent we bout due 4 a new slot by y'all?!! And btw, them dayz y'all unlock all the slots 4 us 2 play, literally blow my mind! Keeps me playin waitin 4 the next day...its frequent & that is totally dream!!!! Thank U!!!! ✌️👍❣️"

        "I love this game! Its BEYOND ADDICTIVE! There is no Methadone to cure or lure one away from the graphics, variety of bonus games or ever changing levels that erase reality and become the Pied Piper as its classical music lures one into its universe of gaming. This is a \"slot,\" which appeals to those who also enjoy a nether-universe of of scifi/fantasu. Its visually appealing, as well as, fun!!!! An AWESOME SITE!!!",
        "Yes it looks and sounds amazing. But short of that, this slot game is completely unremarkable. Just like every other slot game out there, wins are few and far between. The hourly bonus is weak aswel. When you're at a level that requires you to max bet (25000000 or more) and you win 1000000 on the hour bonus and have nothing in the credit meter due to the lack of free spins and no bonuses, it becomes very frustrating. Install if you're easily entertained by graphics and sound, because thats seriously the only thing you will get from this.",
        "THE PLOTS(NOT SLOTS,LOL)ARE THE BEST ,GRAPHICS ARE GREAT AND YOUR NOT JUST PLAYONG A SLOT,YOU ARE REALLY IN TO THE GAMES!!!!! I HAVE TO SAY IT JUST GETS BETTER AND MORE INVOLVED THE MORE YOU PLAY. THANK YOU.10+!It just gets better and better!!!!! Love it more and more!! thanks again THEY KEEP ME  EAGER TO GET TO THE NEXT ROUND OF  PLAY.   KEEP  THEM COMING. THANK YOU",
        "Used to be fun and worth maybe occasionally spending a few bucks on. Now early levels easier but struggle to ever get past first 3 levels. Seems to be just about getting you to spend real money now. Better have your big boy wallet or not worth installing. Really too bad.",
        "This is the best online slots game ever.  This game has so many awesome graphics and great prizes for everyone playing.  Thanks Murka for keeping for the last 2 years of  my sleeplessness nights soooo very interesting!!!!!  Luv ya bunches....waiting for more to come.....",
        "I love the graphics and the slot games, I really enjoy playing, but by level 70 some of the missions are just completely ridiculously high and for me that takes away some of the enjoyment, eg. Spin 700 times on max bet - that is just too much. How about give more variety of challenges rather than making them too hard to achieve or too long winded."

There is a bunch of other awesome features that you don't even need to spend money on, so I myself would recommend this game to those who like this sort of thing!   Thanks developers, you're awesome!",
        "Servers seem to be stabilizing so I'm going to change my 1 star review to 3. This game would have been great if they used the same graphics as the story. In this day and age developers have made huge leaps forward in the department and this game doesn't show it. Its jam packed with things to do, customization and other things. If they update the graphics this game would be the masterpiece that it needs to be!",
        "Doesn't seem to work on my mobile data? I don't have high-speed, but other MMORPGs work perfectly fine on average speed. I get the error message \"Server Connection Lost (0)-1\" or something every time I load it, and have yet to get farther than the loading screen (where the current event pop-up comes on, after the download loading screen.) I was really looking forward to playing. If I can get the app to work (going to try online tomorrow!), I'll happily change my review! I'd really like this to work on my data, though; I don't have wifi at home.",
        "Fantastic game it takes some time to get used to the camera angles (It would be even better if you could rotate the camera around your character, it improves the atmosphere). Combat is ... Well it takes time to get used to that too that could use some improvements. Character design is good I like it Story is good also (Still progressing). Overall great game few small updates and changes will make it a even better game.",
        "Great game. It's a good port of the aura kingdom pc. It has nice graphics, options for auto questing and auto path finding for those who needs it, a nice story line, and it's f2p players friendly with the gifts from events and a fair eidolon gacha. Paying is not needed, but can be done if you wanted. Overall a nice game. I'm waiting for the next updates :)",
        "Just as a personal opinion, a 60 fps option would be a good  initial long term patch to be working on. Also you need to realize the fan base your working with, I haven't played the pc version but it looks like some of your fans transitioning from pc top mobile aren't very happy.  Also the mobile rpg type game fans are pretty hard to please initially, we've probably been through tons of other games with the same approach as you. Other than that I would think about how to polish the game up a bit more, maybe look at other games and see what elements make them look polished verses your own game?"

        "It s a good game , by a good company,many options (that many options that I have not tried each and every one!) But I have rated it 3 stars as:- no 1:- there comes an ad after each and every nail you design , sometimes even after every step you do! Due to that one star Gone and no 2 :-When you are making designs on the nail , you cannot make strips , hearts , umbrellas and stiff you can design with shiny nail polish , I wish we could do that also and now because of these two things , two WHOLE stars gone , only three stars left.",
        "Buyer beware, I purchased the \"unlock all manicures\" option less than a year ago, not only to unlock options but also to remove Ads for my kids. It's less than a year later, and ads are back, with an option to remove them for another fee. When paying just about 8 bucks less than a year ago, I find this distasteful. At least give a full year of ad free gameplay. Not impressed.",
        "I actually had this game a long time ago but have not rate this yet. At first all the colours were not unlocked yet so i was pretty disappointed. After a while everthing was unlocked so i was super excited. It doesn't get me board everytime i have different desins to do.",
        "A really nice game which also got me hooked up! Nevertheles, it frequently and automatically shuts down, deleting what was there.....this really broke my litlle sister's heart, even mine. For we were working on one for a long time and after one of thise repetitive ads, the app shut down.....",
        "Its the BEST game I EVER played! Also, when I was 4, we didnt unlock anything. Now I am 17 and we have every thing for free! I love glitchs. Dont try to fix them though!  I love them and u sould 2. Peace out!",
        "I  am finally at the final last level! Before I thought it was boring but after I reached some levels farther I thought it was awesome! And it is the best game ever! YEAH!!!!!!!!😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘😘💙💙💚💚💛💛💜💜💗💗❤❤ AND when I was playing my 1st game all things were opened but when I played in my small sister's tab all, things were closed! I got everything for free!!

        "It's great fun!! My only problem is when I watch first position in events those fast bikes look really fake. I hope it's just how it looks and it's not the actual game physics when I unlock those bikes. My biggest problem is tournaments. They have different categories for entry cost but the high speed players can still enter and win any tier tournament below Thier skill level. They should not be allowed to dominate lower tier players",
        "If there is anything that would make me quit playing this game, it would be ads. I don't mind ads but ads are just way too much and take away the fun of this game.  Apart from that game also freezes sometimes and there are some glitches too.",
        "Great game. Only criticism is, when your racing with other players where there are lifts etc. They can bypass the lift and go over water like it's just not there. And like others have said during tournaments the leader is like 10 seconds faster and supposedly on the same bike. There must be hackers there is no way at all the bikes fly or hover. Come on guys get a grip on this so it's fair for everyone",
        "I liked the older versions of this game, but this one is horrible. There's ads constantly, any time you resume playing from the screen going to sleep, or if you wreck there's one right across the middle of the screen!  Every time it connects to the server, it takes whole minutes to load. Sometimes I set my phone down, the screen goes to sleep and then i have to watch another ad! If I was waiting for it to load an ad in the first place, I have to watch that one first, then a second one as punishment for the screen time out. 😒😒 Not cool Loading times plus ad videos constantly, equates to more than time spent playing. It's miserable. LG V20 on Tmo and 100Mbps wifi",
        "Bit hard to get used to at first. But when the bikes been upgraded and Machu Pichu opened game gets much more enjoyable and less frustrating. Smoth graphics with good gameplay. Any purchase gets rid of ads but at nearly £5 for cheapest purchase it's a bit steep (and you get very little for your £5). But, all in all, a very good game that's worth sticking with.",
        "Cherishable app! I love it, just some minor problems: - Has plenty ads and never skip once when quite competition.  - Its controls should be customizable.  - Partners' profiles should be viewable.      Thank you for your help!"

        "Really enjoy this game but its very hard to do well unless you pay real money to buy extras! There should be more benefits without paying for them and each comoleted challenge should provide more money and diamonds than it currently does! And it should be easier to move up levels- I've played for months now and still only at level 5! People will just get bored of playing",
        "So this game Is fun and addicting BUT it favors those with money to spend. I understand that the creators of the app want money from it but at least make it fair for the players when it comes to voting on outfits and such l. The hair accessories in this game cost $10 which is 1 accessory for 3 -5 hairstyles. That's a rip off.",
        "The app is really good. It's addictive. But, I really feel they should give out cash or diamonds more easily. If we could earn diamonds or cash for watching a video then it would be great. Cause it takes time for the looks to get voted and until then we cannot play and wait for the diamonds. It's kinda sad. Hope they'll look into this.",
        "A very addicting, interesting game. The graphics are very real and there are hundreds of styles and brands to choose from. One problem is, it is very hard to budget your money. You get diamonds and tickets every day, which helps, but it is still hard to keep a good income. Otherwise, Covet Fashion is a great game, and I would definitely recommend it.",
        "So the new GM for Covet has blatantly admitted that they are pandering to LCV/new players now. I have spent THOUSANDS on this game to get myself to hcv in 11mos and now I'm being screwed over for it? What kind of business favors new customers over established ones that spend the most money? These are the same players that have openly admitted to voting against us!",
        "Love this game. Only thing I don't like is that when you buy something it only gives you one item. In the Design game it gives you several when you purchase an item. I find it hard to play this game bc I run out of money and diamonds too quick. If that aspect changed I would give it 5☆"

Your replies seem to be automated with certain words triggering certain responses. Sort your stuff out people, get your house in order and give us what we deserve. Our legendary bonnet head. I will be uninstalling if you don't come around",
        "Fun game. Good graphics, and overall good fishing simulator. However, its ridiculously rigged. I can only win 1 out of 4 rounds in 1v1, cause unless I get lucky, my opponents always get humongous fish, while I have highly upgraded lures with all boosters active yet I catch tiny ones. The game is addictive but the rigged aspect needs to be fixed so there's a fair chance for everyone to succeed.",

SO STOP READING AND GET TO DOWNLOADING THIS APP, AND GET TO ALL THE INCREASABLE FISHING FUN!!!!!!😎😋🤣😄😅😁😂🤗😜😛😌😳😱😰",

I have to be at work at 6:00am. Download this game now! Thank you for making an AMAZING fishing game. Hats off to the creater's",
        "This game is great and what it does, massive castles sprawling battles across the ages with wizards on dragons back firing missiles at unicorns below... Erm it's fishing they lured me in and I'm hooked, what else is there to say. Great game.",
        "At the start you can play for about 1-2hrs; Then you have to wait for 8 more hours because you can't upgrade anything, or earn anything. From then on it's more of a chore then anything fun. The game starts out confusingly so lots will spend the free in game currency they give you, that you desperately need to speed up pack openings! Then before you even know how the game progresses they ask for a review, and reward the player for giving a 4 or 5 star rating(these are the only options). Not very admirable practice in my opinion! They have a solid foundation of a good \"FTP\" game; But seems like they are more interested in making money then developing a desirable gaming experience."

        "The responsiveness of the controls I  this game make it unplayable... it's slightly more responsive than the original sonic dash but it's still no where near good enough for such a fast paced game.  I tested this on other devices before I posted this review and it's the same on all of them",
        "Way too many advertisements. I actually downloaded this game because subway surfer makes start over everytime you download it but after my next tech upgrade I'm going back to that, atleast the game not flooded with ads.",
        "I would give it 5 stars, I made an in app purchase to remove ads, but after the game updated non Sega ads started showing again and it asked me to make another purchase in order to remove the non Sega ads AGAIN... love the game, hate the ads...",
        "TOO MANY ADS!! Decent game but ruined by an add every 20s. Sonic forces doesn't have half as many adds as this game but isn't as good so looks like Sega have fallen short trying to add more pounds to their fortunes and made the game unplayable.",
        "Ads are back. I paid for a red ring bundle, which did remove them for a while, but they're back. The only reason I made a real purchase was so that I wouldn't have ads, so can someone please remove the ads from my account. On another note, I really like this, and nice to see Shadow playable again."

        "Waste of a license. You'd think a game based on a movie about a game would involve some of the elements of the movies or the game but no, it's just an exact clone of the Pirate Wars game with  Clash of Clans rewards and card levelling mechanics but much worse than either and with a Jumanji skin thrown over it to grab extra cash.  You want to compete? Better get that second mortgage because this game is strictly p2w.  *Edit* Since several updates, opening a bag takes almost as long as unlocking it - loading - loading - loading.",
        "Great time killer. Graphics are pretty good. Opening the backpacks gets monotonous, it would be better with less graphics or if it were just faster. Keep up the great work guys.",

        "CRASH, CRASH, CRASH, UNINSTALL!!! Edit March 8th, new update yesterday, works for 3minutes now before crashing. At least it KINDA works now. Could be good, but isn't. March 1st, 2018 @ 7pm eastern time. The game loads, and as soon as I touch ANYTHING it crashes the game, so I reload the game, and again, I touch anything, and the game crashes. A few days ago this started, actually, as soon as I was FORCED to update the game is when it started. A little note for the developers, if the game doesn't work, people won't play and you won't make money off the ads, it's really that simple. You really need to make the game stable before you bring in new content. I haven't played a match in at least a week due to the game crashing. So, ultimatum time I guess, I'll give you a couple days to respond or release another update or I'm just going to delete the game and never come back to it, even if it becomes a viral game (which it won't if it doesn't work for more than 3.5 seconds). Maybe talk to other developers and find out why it's so unstable. Just a suggestion."

However, the game is not balanced for casual players and the development put a huge emphasis on pay to play. If you want to climb you really have to give up your life and keep climbing, and pay so you can simply redo your skills as you gain more. Hard to justify committing so much time.",

        "I love this game and feeling of accomplishment you get when passing an exceptionally hard level, and you can even further the accomplishment by collecting all the diamonds on a level to get the crown. Only thing that frustrates me is the fact that you can only achieve a new high score if you play from the current level you are on and upwards. You should be able to go  back to a previously passed  level and have the ability to get a new high score that way. Other then that, great game!!",

And the most silly tyings are about those relics/chests/shells, where they have very big power compared to other real big fish, and they can jump out from the water like a blue marlin. Gosh....what the heck....LOL 😂😂😂😂",

Its like one of those deer or bear or dinosaur (I'm pretty sure they have dinosaur too now lol) shooting games...the ones that have the siiick graphics and the rifle upgrades as u go along... Only this is with fish... And a fishing pole!!! Other then that it's pretty similar to one of those... only with this one u get different tanks to keep ur catches in if u want.. or u can sell em 🤣 I'm happy so far!!!",

        "Cool game and really realistic. I give it a good rating. But can you plz update game sothat more players can join 1 room and plz plz plz plz add more possibility's like feeding cows can give more cows and then you can sell some of your cows and buy new ones. Or you can build a pig stall and buy/sell pigs and upgrade a farm house or build a horse place. Or paint some buildings. I would spread the game to all my friends and people i know if you add some of those things. Plz add some of them cause I really like the game alot.",
        "Good games. Fun.. Need more equipments for farm like oldest planters to newest planter balers drill seeds ects. Need john deere too. Need rid of slurry thing not need it. All need is manure and spreader or just hual manure to make mulchs for fields to cover up dirts and need oldest tractors to newest tractos also",
        "Purchased a bunch of tractors and unlocks and had my account charged only to find the game to block me from using my purchases. This game is a money scam. Do not be tricked into making in app purchases. I even tried contacting giants software to give them a chance to correct but to no surprise i did not recive a response to my email, they got my money why would they care now. Save yourself from being taken by this company!!!!",
        "I have absolutely no qualms about giving 5 stars. It's a nice game. I  hope their updates will give an alternative way to the tilt control of vehicles. It's tiring. Can you also consider faster response to queries to your customer care Department?",
        "This is the best game ever I saw for farming. It haves the controls amd graphics. But still theres problem that whenever I purchase any tractor and sell it after I want another tractor then I cant purchase it. The option of purchasing becomes blur. So please make it better. If I will not see any improvement than I will less the stars rated. Regards Jagdish Gadhvi",
        "WHERE are half of my purchases??!!?? I know for sure I bought the big red harvester and the bigger mower, tredder, and wind rower yesterday. My first save has them but today its saying their all locked and I have to purchase again... and yesterday I'm pretty sure I got charged for 250k coin package twice and only received coins for 1 purchase. Can you please fix this or I will be forced to contact Google billing to solve this. FYI I have tried the restore button but that doesn't work as well. I gave you guys several days to respond and nothing. So I'm going to have to cancel those charges"

        "Amazing game I have played it a lot recently. Only problem is when trying to exit the game mid level by swiping from the top or bottom, you hit the ball as well so you lose a life unnecessarily. Also it would be nice to have randomly generated levels Edit: After the most recent update I can't play the game because I get an error message when I start the game. UPDATE: I emailed the developers about this issue and they have not responded after almost 2 weeks",
        "Its hard to swing.... Its very hard to swing.....I like this game, its very fun. I'm conplaing for 2 reasons. Reason 1: Making levels is fun but, it doesn't save your level if your'e exiting the game. Reason 2: The game lags, and its hard to control the ball. So, I'm not saying I don't like this game. its just that its hard to control the ball and swing.",
        "When i first downloaded it, it was an amazing game until around a week into having it this happened. On opening it, the game had a black box with random text on it then when i countiuned on it erased all my data😭",
        "I thought the gameplay was good but the lives system is stupid.  I understand it may add longevity and challenge to the game, but I was playing to relax, and I can't when I have to be pixel perfect with the added pressure of losing lives during the process of trial and error.  You should add a mode where you can play without lives at all, and not a practice mode.",
        "In the current version, I am getting an error in action number 1 in Create Event for obj_init. This only occured after updating to android 8.0. Currently the game is unplayable. Please fix this soon. (Update 3-1-18: issue still persists)",
        "Amazing time-killer. I became sad when I finished all the levels. Pls add more!!"

        "Great game and I love it! However when game is buffing or out of range they take the coins or if in bonus it kicks you out and money is lost and never returned nor does it place you back where you left off. PLEASE FIX THIS PROBLEM IMMEDIATELY! thank you. I still rate it 5 star cause I know you guys are going to handle it.",
        "at first was a blast but as any new slot game it tightens up and harder to level up. graphics are great but i will not buy coins on a daily basis in order to keep playing. so sad that this game turned out to be like the rest of them.",
        "Gameplay is interesting and sort of a hybrid of a Big-Fish-style game and those other too-many-blinky-lights and too-many-mission games. What irks me, though, is that you can't revert back to lower limits when your chips shrink. They may think that will make me buy chips, but they think wrong. One other thing: A game associated with NatGeo should be able to hire proofreaders and copy editors so that grammatical errors don't show up in the game.",

        "This is an idle game with effort and pretty fun writing, with a lot of ways to feel rewarded without cracking your wallet. It's obviously not the driving game but if you want an idle/clicker, you can't really go wrong with this one. The character diversity is a genuine highlight more games could take a note from.",
        "The fast pace of the game keeps you hooked.  They don't throw ads at you but certainly make them available for great benefits.  It's not clunky at all which makes it easy to pick up and play a couple minutes here and there.  It's a ridiculous concept of making money off taxis/fares, heck I'd move to the cab driver profession if I made &gt;$500 million on one fare... but funny and fun nonetheless.",
        "I really like this game a lot. I'm not usually into these idle games, but from all the ones ive tried. Ive enjoyed this one the most. Other then the occasional slow down, it mostly runs great. And the model for ads is very very fair. If you decide to watch and ad, you always get some kind of reward out of it. But its completely optional.",
        "It's okay and the graphics are really nice, the sound effects are good but ultimately, you play and play and play and play and still not got to the other towns. I've got to about the 7th and had enough of trying to get further and not progressing much. It's okay for a few days but after that, and like someone else has mentioned about the ads, too many to get little rewards",
        "Huge battery drain compared to any other game i have played including the new tekken and sims mobile games which are much more graphical. Will sometimes lose game progress when you completely close the app (so not running in background). Taxi's occasionally get stuck on buildings or vanish off screen completely. If it wasn't for these issues it could be a much better game.",

Tried to play for more than five minutes is making the phone first freeze the screen then restart itself. Some cabs never arrive. Need a lot of bugfixes right now. Other than that it is a good game that i like."

Upgrades cost a fortune and collecting boxes are few and far between and earning cash with off-road challenges is just a drop in the bucket of money you'll need for an upgrade. I'm not saying everything should be cheap and easy, but should increase cash values or offer other ways to earn cash.",
        "Please go back to the update before the latest one. The previous physics where perfect. Trucks moved and jumped perfectly. And the camera (free camera) followed the truck perfectly in order to see the suspension moving with the terain. Now the camera does not stay where you want it. Now it moves out of place in (free camera) because it touches rocks, trees etc. Physics have become so fake. Please change back the camara and physics. I unistalled other games because this is all I spent time with. But now I dont know?",
        "nice! im waiting for long time for the game like this... and this is it. but, please add more common truck like nissan navara, toyota hilux vigo & revo, mitsubishi triton, ford ranger 3.2, isuzu dmax.. and also please fix the mud graphic to more realistic.. thanks..",
        "Hey devs, great game, I think a winter map or just more maps would be awesome as well as an option to sell vehicles rather than just collect them. Overall I gave everything but the controls 5 stars becuase id like to see custom placement of things like the gas, break, shifter, etc. Great job overall",
        "This game suck because it never work it always lags out and every time it says loading trailer it goes back to my home screen. In my review i mean all of this and hope ypu make your game better so it doesn't suck but for now it does suck.",
        "This game is literally what I have been looking for. This is the perfect offroad game. I just wish that there were A LOT more maps and vehicles to chose from. It's boring to constantly go to the same maps. Also the multiplayer is pretty fun. Expand the maps and create new ones please!"

Edit: it won't allow me to invite friends, I'm able to play one game a day unless I continuously buy more tokens...but with ads after every game, they get funding from them. I installed this game because the reviews were the best, but maybe it's just got a grudge against me!",
        "I understand they are trying to make money off this app, but if you are going to charge someone 320 tickets to play 4 cards, the reward should be more than 70 tickets per win.  I mean, really?! Some people want to play bingo, but want something to work toward without being bored.  I played Bingo story and deleted it, because I had a lot of credits, but EVERY BOARD WAS THE SAME.  Also, the powerups in this game should be limited to what you have available, and not have to purchase because you are out of said power up.  It might make more people play if they are rewarded.  .  I mean the quests saying you will win 600 tickets if you complete the quest, but you're spending on the normal side 280+ tickets, really?  And no other options besides watching ad videos for free credits?  And I'm not saying to add a \"download this app and run it for 3 tickets.  Reach level 300 for 40 tickets.\"  Rant over",
        "Everything would be pretty neat, but there should be another way to get more tickets. I've been stuck at the New York state for several days now, cause I can only replay the first stages with the tickets from the daily bonus.",
        "Love it. The only reason I didn't give 5's across the board is it gets costly per game as you gain levels. The games are way fun and you can play up to 8 cards !!!!!",
        "There should be more ways to get or win more tickets and power-ups. I also think the costs per cards increases too much from board to board. Other than those two issues, I love this game. Would play more if there were other ways to get/win tickets, the purchase costs is ridiculous for the middle/working-class.  I'd rather pay my bills than buy fake in-game tickets that CAN'T win me REAL CASH. Thank you keep up the good work.",

The gameplay and controls are ok besides the repetitive fights. The boss battles are incredible at best. If I would rate it from a 1-10, I would give it an 8.

        "This game is a money sucker! Don't get conned into a first experience (its deceptively fun at first, great graphics, good payouts)...then they lead you into buying coins...and suddenly nothing. You can spin any game, at any bet level, even buy more chips but the payouts absolutely disappear. It will  happen to you, trust me.  Beware of Jackpot Party!  THEY FLEECE THEIR PLAYERS!",
        "Got the feeling playing for free is a frowned upon activity. Ads won't play to get free coins, coins I did get went so fast it's just not worth it. I wonder if your advertisers know you block videos from playing. I could understand if it were for real money but this is (WAS) my bathroom game.",
        "Warning: dont spend real money buying credits because you will lose your credyts during bonus rounds. The game wil freeze. You will have to close and if you go back to game, credits are gone. Dont spend real cash. Go to a real casino",
        "I like the bonus upgrade dislike the amount of the bets being raised so high can only play for a very short time because of this so not happy with that part of the upgrade😳im enjoying the newest games very much. I enjoy playing but the amounts to play are much too high",
        "I use to actually win back in the day on this app but now it's about impossible. Also the ad videos for free coins is a complete scam !!!! You receive 200k coins which is basically a spin and you will not win. All free coins from ads will not produce any wins. Please tell me there is not a different payout percentage off the ad coins. But you're making real money from us watching  the ad. Mmmmmmmm....",
        "I wanted to play Jackpot Party.  I have played the game in casinos..  unfortunately I  can't play it because it isn't  there.  I have to play through tons of other games for who knows how long to get to the game to unlock it. If you want to play the game this isn't the place to do it"

        "Its world best game ever played.  It is like a small GTA of phone or for android. It doesn't look too good but if u download and play it will like a real GTA. It is a quite big but the game is super amazing. It is not too interesting in starting but later u can play it like a GTA. It also not need any extra files to download after downloading from play store but it needs Internet connection.",
        "Sir i have some problems. My suits has low DPS from my other friends I upgrade all skills but nothing happend. My osteo x mediam lvl.1 has 840DPS and i compare my friends they has more DPS.  When i up on the small vehicle with my  Monster Truck(heavy vehicle)  the small vehicles can't wreak. Plzzzzz do something for me. It's a request. My problems are not solved.",
        "This game might not look so good when you download it, but there is a lot you can do. Buy properties to get money, buy guns armor, cars. There are plenty of minigames and quick play missions like street races, survival, and parachuting. The storyline may only be decent, but the missions are still fun.  The only real problem is the file size. You have to dedicate too much of your storage, if you have a newer phone with more built in storage, or a microSD card, you should try this game.",
        "Great game thanks. as smooth as we like it well-done. To google players if you are  looking for action GTA 5 style then this is the game for you. I can't wait to get home from work every night make a brew and chill on this till I run out of battery lol class A game. (Again thank you for making this game) can't wait for updates fingers crossed",
        "Huge Kudos to the developers for making this game!! It's amazing it's literally like playing GTA but on your phone it has the story mode and it all makes sense!! The graphics are ok but I'm sure if they made this again in a Los Angeles version of some sort the graphics could get better and better!! Overall Amazing game and there's nobody else making games like this on the app store!! Great job! 10 out of 10 stars!!!",
        "Wow this game is so fun! when you go the airport, there are planes yay! and one thing you have to add to the game, please add some more hotels that are in the real Las vegas and I love the daily bonus and the one thing I hate, the military base where you get killed by a jackalope tank, bustard helicopter and the iron horse and please make the military base free to enter without getting 5 stars note: version is 3.6"

That means you can progress through it without even spending a dime. Its a simple game with decent graphics to play at leisure and has become my current pass time.  Update 3/22/18  I decreased my rating to three stars (from 5) until the developer can correct the latest flop from most recent update. Flop regards being able to log in but paralyzed from any action that requires an in game pop up. I including the \"Help\" module which is used to contact dev with. If no improvement after a week, I will delete game and draw stars to 0.",

        "Overall great game as far as playing is concerned. Major thing that could use work is matchmaking. Currently an 89 overall getting matched against 98-105 overall players. No chance to win and may discourage some people from playing the game. The gameplay is awesome and I have lots of fun, 100% worth your time if you avoid Head-to-head or tournaments (unless you have money or don't mind being poorly matched).",
        "This is my full honest review. Madden Mobile is back!! I'll admit before it was not fun and I complained that you need to pay to win but EA really did good when I came back to play. The game is fun and is somewhat easy to get 100 overall players and now they are bringing back Draft Champs and I have seen early drafts and it looks great. The promos are great. I would like to say great job EA on bringing this game back and making it fun. I always want to play everyday and build my Ultimate Team",
        "I have played this game for 3 seasons now.  I can't even begin to say all that is wrong, but one of the things that stands out most to me, is that your players stats mean nothing.  You spend a lot of time and effort completing events and grinding, and improve your team only to find out that when you play a team way below your level, it seems that that teams players are much faster and tend to play way above their ability.  this game seems to have the liberal bug that everyone is equal.  I am done with this game, don't get caught up with it, it's not worth the waste of your time",
        "Thanks alot EA for this new head to head style. Great to know that all the grinding and work put in is only allowing those who have a 100 overall or better reap the rewards. Everytime playing one of these individuals they have a counter for every single play. This really turns me off to the game.",
        "For the person hoping to find Madden 18, this is the closest thing you are gonna get. Yes, it doesn't have practice mode or my player mode, but it DOES have a incredible roster of players that you bargain for. The graphics are pretty good for a game on a smartphone.  Overall, this game is a MUST HAVE for NFL fans. 10 outta 10.",
        "You know I really like all of the Live Events but when I get these old collectible cards that aren't worth anything I have to cut them one by one. It takes way too long and I've got over a hundred. I would suggest having a way to group delete or in Madden terms \"cut\" the old dead weight."

        "Thank u guys for this game. Best wolf game I've ever played. Highly addictive. Thank u so much.   If u can, it would be nice to be able to make people into friends and pack mates. Edit: thanks for that. Its better than I imagined.  Being able to mate and having to take care of pups would be cool. Like how they have Co-op and PvP tabs, maybe u can have another tab that says survival or something. It can kinda be a mixture of both Co-op and Pvp. Every wolf can be an enemy or a friend. You'd have to hunt and drink to survive or die from lack of it. You and your pack has to protect the pups and keep everyone fed. Maybe there can be weather and habitat differences. Night and day changes. And u have to survive with your pack in the snow, the mountains, the desert, the forest, or in a really big map that has all of it. Idk but it would make having a mate and a pack actually mean something. And taking care of pups would be nice. Just a suggestion. Hope u guys consider it.",
        "OMG love this game so much. For me being up north is amazing u can see real wolves but this game takes it to a new level. I love it so much the pride of the pack is great not only that u can talk to people it's super fun. I'm more of a northern girl I don't like the city but this game is so much like home when I play it while I'm away from home it makes me happy",
        "I LOVE IT AND MADE LOTS OF FRIENDS!! This game is awesome and is time killing too! I love the song when you click the game and it's loading! I also love the wovles too! The only thing I wish it has is more then two places to go...it's the same maps over and over and it's ok I just think there should be more maps or something but over all I love it!! It's amazing! One of my favorite games! You have to play it.",
        "I love that you can use powers but I think there should be more wolf species and more places you can go like the city the artic or the deserts also can you put a large boss so everyone in co-op can kill it and it's really strong so hackers carnt do it themselves. It would be nice to see low level people and high level people hanging out like level 50s and level 10s. Also I wish there was a single player mode other than that make more games!! Like the deer or a Fox in a farm the den could be an abandoned dog den. Make a deer online its been my dream. Plus I have all the games you have made so far. Plz hurry and make a new game now!!!",
        "Pretty chill game 👌👌👌 The way you earn points in PVP is pretty cool too. If you kill someone, you get points depending on how high their level is. If you help to kill them you don't get as much points but you still get some. I haven't experienced any glitches yet. Comtroller can be slightly annoying when trying to escape, but other that that it's cool. ⭐🌟⭐🌟⭐",
        "Giving it 2 stars because I get lag spikes every second for a couple seconds. I can't play like that. Giving it 2 stars only cuz its a game I would play daily. Shame, btw I'm using Note 7 so such a game even on high should run 60fps. I'm on very low and still getting lag spikes."

        "Great Game This game it truley fun to play! I don't understand why the rating is so low for it. The graphics are amazing and I like that you can connect with friends and play together. Honestly even though its a great game I wish we didn't have to wait to get more tokens to play. However if you really like the original game board Monopoly, than I suggest you get this app!! Don't judge a game by its rating!! ((;",
        "Computers players dice rolls feel manipulated. Also needs speed play to eliminate animations and skip to result of computers turn for faster rounds. Boring waiting for computer players to end their turns. Need more explanation of chance cards and swap options. Good concept and sound.. good graphics.. Stamps collected should literally be stamps in passport book.. not chips that doesn't make sense. Anyways I like it but the dice rolls feel pretty fishy.",
        "Needs more coins Game definitely would be a favorite of mine but the lack of coins is a bit disappointing considering how much fun it really is. 1or2 coins just isn't enough and needs some of the authenticity of the old board game Incorporated into it to make for longer gameplay. Hotels, community chest, ect. Then you would have my 5 🌟's.",
        "Good but what's the point? Good gameplay. Good graphics. Quicker than actual monopoly to play... However there is no incentive to win... No leader board, no win lose stats, no rewards, no unlockables... Nothing. So who cares if you come second third or fourth (that's just a loss) ... It should have win 25 games and unlock a different board or background or dice... The game would be worth 5 stars if it gave you reason to play.",
        "Format is good, ability to play the game fairly is poor. Several times I've had a card played against me and did not know, so I couldn't use the 'just say no' card I had. Other times I've tried to use a card in the 3 seconds you get to react, but despite pushing the green tick to activate it - did not work. I lost the last game with 3 cards that I tried to use but couldn't...   Oh yeh, I bought 2 other versions of Monopoly on my galaxy 4 that I can't use on my galaxy 6, so I won't be buying this one..",
        "Could be better I like the concept... you have to wait entirely too long for your coins to regenerate.  Also why can't we play with random people online?  Good game over all but not worth 4 bucks for unlimited play with what is offered.  Basically you can play once per day smh... rethink this please then maybe I will rate it better or even buy it.  Why make it a free game and you really can't play"

        "Going to give up on this game I have been made to watch the same 30 second ad every other turn. More than half of the time I play this game is the black panther film ad, how many times do I have to watch the same ad...ridiculous overkill. There is no way I will go and see that film now because  your barrage of ads has made me annoyed at the mention of it.",
        "Possibly the worst app I have ever used. Memory hungry, battery draining - the phone actually gets hot! - and you are held to ransom by endless boring repetitive ads, or you pay through the nose to avoid them. But it's Scrabble, a great game, so what can you do? You learn to ignore the ads.    Too many silly words are allowed these days, so it's easier to play, but it remains a great game despite the shortcomings of this due app. But there are far too many adverts.",
        "Notifications don't work. Adverts interfere with game play. Games do not load or refresh properly (seems to be due to loading adverts timing out). Just an awful experience. If EA had any decency they'd make a single payment purchase option for Android users to remove adverts.",
        "Would be 5 stars if I could lose the ads I can deal with ads you can shut off... Having to watch a video is ridiculous. Rather pay a fiver for the app than watch a gin advert 50 times Oh and why is pilates not in the dictionary? It's in Collins online?",
        "Overall, I would not download this game for the following reasons.  Firstly, how come so many words are not recognized? Seriously, June is not a valid word, so are there only 11 months in the year then? However, words like upta do!   Secondly, this app drains battery life as though is using your phone to power a planet. You need to invest in your own power station, if you want to play this game for 10 -15 min sessions.  Thirdly, even for a free app there are too many adverts. I actually forgot I was playing a game and was about to open a bag of popcorn for the feature movie to begin.  Will be uninstalling now.",
        "Forget the ads, the app is very annoying. Its is plagued with connectivity issues. Ads loads first (at the bottom) before your pending Scrabble games is updated...and that is IF the game lists updates without resulting in network error. Often, it will need repeated restarts to update the list or starting a new random online game to force it.  I cannot recommend this app to first timers because it is frustrating. The Scrabble game cannot be enjoyed as EVERYTHING must be online...even Solo play. Look elsewhere until issues are addressed."

One problem that have occured for some time, there's no more english subtitles. I don't know what will be the reason for that, but please bring it back. The cutscenes are not useful if you can't understand it.",
        "Its got amazing graphics and great gameplay..but when i close the game for a short time and reload it..the screen always goes black and nothing loads. Ive already tried force stop and unstalling and reinstalling it and 80% of the time its a black screen! Please fix it!! It's certainly worth 5 stars if it loaded 100% of the time! Thanks :)",

I missed playing games like this so much and I must say this game brings back memories when I played Naruto crazily. Brings the crazy inner gamer out! So yes! I love this game! Thank you♡ And everything is perfect too!",

Can you please allow spaces on the name like  *Otaku world*  Because it would be more better :D  And I like All the character's and the kawaii Ai chan :3  I really do like this game. I love anime and I love how you can chat with your friends. But if you touch the person in the menu like when you touch the Tummy when your on to the next heart. Can she PLEASE say *Baka! Watashi no yo ni watashi ni furenaide kudasai!* If you know what this means. Your Game is very fun ;)",

I would really love it if there was an option to log in using my email account because I don't use Facebook. I'm really scared something might happen to my game progress.",
        "the game is almost perfection, however there are still room for improvement on minor details, like font and in game description as most of the description are cut off half way if too long. also events should be roll out more timely than to throw you ll at one there's too much to focus on. overall the game is great."

        "I think that it's a good game worth downloading to try. It is a big jump from Smashy Road: Wanted, to Smashy Road: Arena. My favorite thing about this game is that you can customize your car to suit your personality. I would LOVE this if you could customize and add guns to a version more like Smashy Road: Wanted. The reason being that in Smashy Road: Wanted, there is no boundaries, but there is also no customizable cars... If there was a hybrid version with no boundaries and customizable cars I would be hyper! Thanks, TheWetBandits",
        "This game is very fun and addicting, has a great art style, and most importantly I can play with my friends. One thing that I would add is a setting to disable the 2D pixels on the ground when you drive off-road. To me, they do not look like they fit the art style. Another thing to fit the art style  more would be to add more maps that look more like Smashy Road: Wanted. Overall, I give this game a 4/5 rating.",
        "It is a #1 game I've played. There is 1 little problem. The cops just corner my legendary truck into the corner of the map and push me into the water. I love blowing em up and tricking them so they drive into the water. I will r8 5 stars if this is fixed. Either way, it is a really good game. I recommend this to everybody. My bro even plays it too! I'm sure he'll leave a rating too!",
        "I've changed my mind the controls and graphics are good to ok to bad.  THE ONLINE IS SO TRASH. YOU KEEP GOING IN AND OUT OF GAMES YOU SWITCH PLAYERS YOU GET TELEPORTED. besides all that single player is boring and online is frustrating. Uninstalled instantly",
        "Some of the cars are hard to control and some dont do their abilities. For example the digger was my favorite car for starters on smashy road because if cops go high speed at your front hood of the car, it would act as a ramp and cops would fly over you.",
        "The multiplayer has to many glitches. I always lose a round because of the swapped glitch. Whenever I die and try to swap at the same time, I keep on falling off the map when I respawn. 4 or 5 stars if you fix this."
