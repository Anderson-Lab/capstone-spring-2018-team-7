        "This game is amazing.  I play several of the spin/build games, but nothing is like this one.  There is so much things that you can do.  I now have my mom, brother, sister, aunt and cousin playing and still bugging other friends and family to play.  Thanks for a great game. LOVE IT",
        "Something has happened.. I am currently playing the attack master event. I have attacked 20 times at least. But the metre only indicates 6 attacks. Everytime I attack I see hammers going to the metre but the number there remains the same. I would have gotten 12 million and evemln more but due to this issue I haven't. It's definitely the fault of game. Please fix it as soon as possible.",
        "Very frustrating to have to work for weeks to earn enough to build in the higher levels and have it constantly being destroyed because in three days worth of spins you only receive 2 shields... not to mention the rarity of free spins (maybe once a week) Game is an exercise in frustration and not worth the download.",
        "I am playing this game in a long time. but i have found some issue.. many time i am not get shield & someone attacked my village. How to upgrade my village. Pls tell me Moon active team & also upgrade spin 50 to 60 & also redused village manufacturar cost... Thank You.",
        "Game was running successfully but now game has stopped working in my phone all of a sudden, I have uninstalled the game and again installed but not working. My mobile handset is Motorola g5 plus and android version 7. Please help me out to resolve the issue asap.",
        "I actually liked this game but recently very glitchy/buggy. I get attacked by the same person twice within less than a min of each, same with raids. I earn for attack/raid master and the counter doesn't update. Freezes in the middle of spins. Don't earn coins for watching videos sometimes. This is even after the most recent update"

        "I just completed all 3185 rounds... took nearly 2 years to do so. A couple of suggestions...  1. Some big reward must be given to the one who completes all the rounds... an uphill task. 2. All these years I played the spin wheel every day ... but not even once the jackpot was opened... it simply shows the malintentions of the programmers who programmed it as such. 3. Boosters must be given more often.",

The music isn't my favorite, I find it somewhat creepy. Greatful for the music mute button.  Thank you Development Crew for a fantastic, free app which I have been playing for years! One suggestion: make it clear $3 gets you one-time access to your piggy bank only. Thanks😄",

Once you take out one licorice another drops....you need to rethink that level, because it's a level that will make people stop playing.... doesn't matter what boosters you use the licorice keeps dropping and you can NEVER clear all the jelly!",

And one more thing, Can you explain why I have to wait over 2800 minutes for my next life? It's been 3 days and it went from 2800 minutes to 2300 minutes! Based on your stupid calculations each day is equal to 170 minutes? Give me your supports group email add and I will send you a screenshot!",

        "I absolutely love this game and have loved it since it came out. I was never too much into Pokemon but this game has made me love everything about it. It's great meeting new people when doing raids and the new gym system is much better. My only improvement would be maybe to make it a little easier to do raids in rural areas. Perhaps lowering the CP, or giving a person more time to complete it alone compared to in a big group. Can't please everyone though! Keep going Niantic, we love you!",
        "I impatiently waited for this game for nearly 2 years. I play it with my 2 best friends and it's changed our lives for the better. We get out more and get much more exercise these days. I love collecting Pokémon and I intend to play Pokémon Go forever. Niantic hasn't yet delivered on all their promises, but they're working diligently and I'm very happy with the game so far.",
        "The battle is rudimentary like always, but that's not what I'm writing this for. Add the pal pad to the trainer menu please. It was an item that the games had to keep a list of your friends. I think that would be a great addition. Have your friends from around the world registered via usernames something to keep an eye on their level up and medals and even pokedex progress. It would be a nice addition I feel the game misses as an often times multiplayer game. I.e. raids and community events",
        "Pokemon Go is a pioneer into the world of AR. This game was a hit despite its incomplete composition, and this is why many people left. However, the game now is more complete with features such as raiding with others and dynamic weather. If you are looking for something new on the move, give it a try! Or if you left after launch, give the game another try and see how the game has updated over time. This game is recommended for suburban/urban players, as in-game features such as pokestops are not abundant. This game is still very buggy so patience is required. Thanks for reading!",
        "I enjoy the game play and weather mechanics and new gyms quite a bit raids are also awesome great idea. I think what would bring alot of original players back is trading pokemon. Then later down the road pvp battles. I hope you take my reveiw into consideration Niantic Inc. From one person who grew up with pokemon these would be great features for the game.",
        "It runs quite smooth and gives me an extra reason to get out and exercise. My only beaf now is that it is impossible to acquire any of the legendaries. If you live in a small rural town you will never have the numbers to take on anything beyond 3 star in raids. Everything else is awesome though."

        "On level 2185, had over 800 different boosters and suddenly all of them are gone, serious glitch in game... emailed their tech center for over 1 week now and only get a automated response and nothing from a real person. Wasted 3 years of time and data on this worthless app.... recommend not installing or uninstalling it... customer service sucks",
        "Ive played this game a long time. New update and instead of making the game better you screw your customers. I lost all my boosters and you expect me to continue? If nothing else its a matter of principle. You punish me by taking everything ive bought and earned, ill punish you by never giving you another dime and i will let everyone i know who plays or asks about any of your games ro stay away.",
        "So frustrated with all the candy crush games. I periodically get angry enough to quit for awhile,  but end up back. Why am I upset? I was just in the middle of a rare winning streak and had earned a number of special candies to start games with. I was up to 2 hour on the fish, multi color candy, and the juicy jawbreaker, with 3 hours of life. Suddenly,  i still had the life but all other rewards disappeared. This is far from the first time. I am tired of it. I am removing the king games and I am not coming back this time. I get glitches happen but I have never had any  Indication  that anyone gives a damn. No one makes anything right or even says,  sorry. I'm ok with a game having issues but I am not ok with being treated less than.",
        "In places with bad connection the facebook popup bug is also annoying and causes you to have to restart, losing lives and the streak. And having to click different buttons to confirm to end a game is stupid design.",
        "Would love to give a better rating, but after the most recent update the game has very bad lag, worse than the usual lag it's always had. Updating this. Was hoping update today would fix the lag. It didn't. Also, adding 2 extra steps in order to replay a stage sucks. You know the old saying; if it ain't broke, don't fix it.",
        "EDIT: Update on 3/22/18 fixed NOTHING! New levels still locked as well! Worst update in candy crush history. Riddled with bugs. It didn't add new levels like it should have. Unlimited boosters don't appear on level when they should. And boosters are no longer allowed on lower levels. I'm at level 2100 something. I should be able to use boosters when ever I want! And I should be able to have unlimited boosters appear on all levels, not just when they feel like it. Fix and I will give more stars."

        "Nice game with very good events but the drop rates to heroes of 5 star is too low i killed a lot of gems and scrols and hero orbs and my first 5 star i  dropped it at lvl 75. Okok now again event of summoning 100 scrolls and i continue still no 5 star hero only 4, just try and fix the drop rate. In the rest its a nice game.",
        "It's a good time passer.  Beware of guild system, it has major flaws. If a guild leader doesn't log on in a while, The guild gets given to another.  When it happened to me it picked the newest, least trusted official, rather than the one who had been there since day 1 or one of the two who actually donate resources to the guild. So we easily lost months of work.",
        "I purchased the spring festival card on top of all the money I've already dumped into this game and the devs didn't give me my in game rewards. I've submitted numerous tickets to get a refund or my rewards and they just reply there is no problem. Ya no problem with you taking my money.  They deleted my review, wonder how many other people had this issue and had reviews deleted.",
        "Wasn't sure about this game at first. I love it. I use a f2p  and a vip one  to see  the difference  between the two. Really well done. Having said all that the game does require patience. This is an IDLE game. You pick it up do dailies, talk, spend money, or what ever you want to do in game, then put it down to \"farm gold,xp,mats\". The high end heros do take some planning to aquire as a f2p player. This game requires patience because it's an IDLE game. Yes some people have a ton of money to throw at the game but don't be jealous, just play your game and have fun.",
        "There is certainly alot to do, but is there really much to DO do? I've just been continually tapping red dots and getting free prizes, which (although nice) doesn't feel like I'm especially earning anything, you know?  Feels like a game that will keep you occupied for maybe months, but a year after you delete it will you really REMEMBER it? Probably not.",
        "Not what I expected, given that my first impression of it was of IH being an \"annoying add\". Once I decided to pick it up though my thoughts changed rather drastically.   It's simple, it's fun and the warm colour palette of the graphics make a nice change compared to the widespread use of bleak colours in other games.   If you think you might enjoy this game, you sure are my friend."

        "Great fun game. Only reason I didn't give it a 5 is because you go through your money pretty quick buying boosts to win levels to then upgrade your garden. I like the game a lot. Also I think that at the end of your board if you have undetonated items they should detonate at the end of that level. I've lost too many levels because of not getting one item that was next to something that was undetonated.",
        "I Love Gardenscapes and It Is Fun Way to Be Creative.  A Recent Update has Made it Definitely Better.  The Support Team Has Been Exceptional With Quick Responses and Answers!  There is Room for Improvement in the Amount of Coins Obtained in Completing Tasks, as Well as Eliminating Repetitious Tasks Requiring More Moves.",
        "I love home scape but it can be quite spendy. Both games are fun.  Love graphics animation laughter now free gifts.  Gardens cape is even more fun doesn't get boring like home scape when pay to win is obvious.  Gardens scape takes 1 or 2 coins with easier quests.   Still favorite.  Home scapes got greedy please return again where its not pay to win.  At times we need a color no bonus and lose because home scape didn't offer the color.  Spending hundreds on home scape so thinking of my budget and returning to garden scape.  Gardens cape started it all. Please lower prices",
        "Either make the puzzles easier or give more Passes to actually be able to pass the level ....make it easier to get to other rooms, too many attention to details..also so many tokens should be able to buy a few stars... I've been on the same room level since I started playing and way past level 100. Starting to get bored at this point.",
        "Much has improved since my original review (see below). There are special events going on quite often to help with earning coins and powerups, and the levels don't seem to be as tedious. Keep it up, guys!   \"I love this game but the levels are often too hard to beat without power-up help, and it takes so long to earn coins. Most of my friends have quit playing\"",
        "The reward for finishing a puzzle is around 50 to 60 coins. It cost 900 coins for 5 extra turns, and 1200 for the next. It has taken me up to 3 weeks playing all my lives as much as possible to finish 1 puzzle. This game is designed to frustrate you into spending money so you can complete the puzzles. Which I wouldn't mind if it was rewarded more fairly. Play Monsterbusters, it is by far more fun, you earn better rewards, and you can buy new lives and power-ups with your coins at a much more fair rate."

Throw in the fascinating story line, lovable characters lovely music and stunning graphics (except the kitchen wallpaper lol), I'll be playing this for a long time! I'm working on the living room right now, getting close to level 800! Thank you Playrix!",
        "Its a mind blowing game i cant help but to play this game my day seems not complete if i cant play the game specially when i cant pass the next level and the hardest part is the hard level the time are very fast when i am playing.i really love it and the freebies i can get everyday to boost my game.thank you creators and the makers the graphics and the animation is very realistic.",
        "This is really exciting BUT the levels get way too hard!!! I want a game that you don't have to replay a level more than a couple times! That's when I stop playing. It's a game...it's supposed to be fun not rocket science!! It should relax you but when you're played a level 6 or 7 times and you get down to needing1move to win... yet again... you get stressed!! And the levels should be concentrated on tasks to fix the house not on things like starting a new day or talking to someone to fix something! PLEASE fix these things so it's fun! I like a challenge but this is ridiculous!!!",
        "Just gave it 2 stars from 3 stars, everytime i use the kite booster it doesn't work and wastes it by flying away. Continued is my previous feedback. Love the game but it is ridiculous how we need stars to start a new day etc. It is difficult to get stars anyway. The lives go out fast because levels are hard. It take 900 coins just for 5 extra turns to finish the level but you get 45 or 50 coins only per level. You need to change this. Make it on the same level, give us atleast 1000 coins per level and let the level have enough stars per task rather than 1 star per level and requirement is 2 stars per task. Something to look into.",
        "Getting green pieces gets extremely redundant. After 30 levels it's still the goal. Levels are near impossible unless you get lucky and things line up perfectly.",
        "I enjoy this game more and more each day.  Is there a possibility to reduce the memory mb? It really takes a lot of storage and slow down my tablet. Thanks"

        "This game is great and could be better if it was fair for everyone that plays! If you are a free to play player you will be destroyed with no way of getting ahead in this game. IGG only wants pay to play players with the upgrades and fixes they have put in this game. The game is fun and would have more people keep playing but once you play for a while and see it takes an ungodly amount of time to do anything in this game people quit. IGG really needs to look at this an make the game more enjoyable for all!",
        "Love this game some people p2p but you dont have to. To level up does not take long and its easy step by step. Also if you you run into events you are not sure of how to do most pros help out . I also love the fact you can send items you need to other like food.",
        "This is a pretty fun game as long as you don't care that IGG doesn't care. I've enjoyed the people I've met (And they're really the only reason I keep playing).  Unless you spend an ungodly amount of money it takes forever to be able to participate with the big guys (and theres ALOT of them. ) Plus there are many glitches that IGG won't ever own up to or reimburse you for. Itsnlike a vending machine play, and pay money at your own risk cuz if you lose, man you REALLY lose.",
        "I thought this games was amazing. Spent a ton of money and it was fun. Then one night, after putting up a 24 hour shield, I was zeroed. Requested IGG look into it and requested reimbursement. Unfortunate that their glitches cause so many issues. They have so many glitches that they cannot find any abnormalities in my 24 hour shield dropping after 6 hours...  will not spend another dime on this game, and I do not believe anyone else should either",
        "This game needs balance. Seems like all one does is hide behind shields and gather resources and hope higher might players harvest you for your resources. There should be a limit on how weak a higher might player can attack. An individual with over 100 million might should not be attacking someone with only 10 or 20 million. This game isnt a war game, its all about hiding behind a shield and being a resource collection for pay to win players"

You can play them all or pick the ones you like best. As a f2p the game presents many opportunities to acquire in game money (especially during the events) - hoard it for energy refreshes. You'll find yourself in very few dry spells needing in game money and energy.",

I have a three star awakened dark pixie, when I tried to evolved her into a three star I tried to use other pixies and they only leveled up her skills, so I used two other monsters to evolve her. This happened again when I tried to evolve her into a four star. Please help!",
        "If your into gathering  monsters to strengthen and fight aswell as evolve then this game is for you. It's very fair and rewarding depending on your efforts. Further expansions for this would see the current fans gain more pleasure out of it and it's already a great game. Liking they added 2 new monsters but seeing that as a regular thing and still keeping current top summons valid would be incredible. Speedy gameplay and no issues for me. Username : violentmaw",
        "Been playing this game for years. Really enjoyed for the first few years. But while years of time past, the rune drop rate and 5* monster summoning rate still remained very low. Its very sad and depressing. Now i just login to settle my guild wars then log off.",
        "Been playing this game every day and it's extremely addicting. Gameplay and graphics are wonderful, support is great, etc. However, it seems to have really become a pay to win game. You'd think that with all the mystical scrolls, summoning stones, attribute scrolls and crystal summonings I've been summoning, I'd at least get a natural 4 star character but i can't even get that. I get garbage every single time. Its frustrating when you put so much time into the game and get nothing in return."

Makes you forget about the game sometimes as you can't do anything else untill it's complete. I refuse micro-transactions so this game now only gets visited once every couple of days. It's a shame really as it's great fun to start with.",
        "Provided the developers with evidence of rampant racism, homophobia and misogyny present in the game. They have so far neglected to take any action against the perpetrators. Unacceptable.  Edit: I have already provided screen shots to you via the Help & Support board, you haven't yet taken action. Please do so immediately.",
        "This game is not made for people who do not spend money. The devs do not control the players who do and therefore those who do not never get the chance to grow because they are constantly having to use resouces to rebuild their troops and this takes away from being able to advance. The kill event being 3 days straight is for the birds . You got to buy gold to purchase shields or you resouces you work for are plundered and often times your army is wounded above your hospital limit so you have to constantly use resouces to be able to heal them.  I just don't understand why the game is for people who spend a lot of money and destroy the ego of those who don't!",
        "This garbage is nothing like ads show. It's a pay to win mmo that brings nothing new to the table. You can always tell a game will be garbage when their ads are fake. Uninstalled!",
        "Unless you are willing to line their pockets with cash your wasting your time on the game.  You'll never catch up to those who have been playing the game a long time without money.  Parents beware.",
        "Absolutely no support available in the game.  If you're able to take money, people should be able to contact you.  Game is also geared for higher level players to advance by ganging up on new players.   I was attacked 19 consecutive times in a 5 minute period with 6 players attacking me at once.  In short, don't waste your time"

        "I am really disappointed that it takes so much to upgrade each time is insane. I love that there are a few things to help but to have to put so much money into it to be able to do that really makes me not want to play, only a week of that but we get attacked so much that it was all for nothing. I must say Alot of people won't stay if this continues and you won't make as much if you contantly let people down on these little things you could fix. Makes us feel like it's only about the money... it should be fun and enjoyable but that's hard when everything takes so much and so long.... Make the money worth spending.",
        "This game has been glitching for the past 20 hours. can't log in. have reinstalled multiple tjmes. my army will probably have been wiped out by someone who has spent 120,000 dollars on his account (yes there are people who have spent that amount and that's what you're up against) glitch laden game. admins don't give a damn. I will get a standard response to this... if any. Don't download. don't play. don't waste your time and money.",
        "It's a good game but the issue is that much higher level players can attack you regularly. And this sets you back on your development. Level 5 players should not be being attacked by level 20 players. You rebuild an army using resources needed to grow only to have a higher level player destroy it again and again before you can even rebuild completely. My army took a day to rebuild and before I could yluse it it was destroyed again. And more resources are wasted. It is a distressing pattern that has put me off the game.",
        "I love how the game is. Our kingdom 489 have the peace treaty. We dun attack others tagged clan bases. We let them grow. But I currently now facing a problem whereby I can't upload my picture profile. It sucks. Help me and you get ur five stars rating. Get back to me asap. I've been trying for abt a month and nothing change",
        "Really sets you back when your attacked by much higher lvl characters/kingdoms. There should be level attacking restrictions for example a lvl 5 kingdom shouldnt be able to be ttacked by a lvl 10 kingdom. My only complaint i hope they fix it soon and come up with a visable solution for all. Thank you",
        "This game changed my life and how I live... Up until now every so called \"strategy game\" has been full of nothing but disappointment but then I came across king of Avalon and I was astonished that such a game existed. The graphics are breath taking and the community is truly like your in another world... 5 stars!!!"

        "I Personally would like to have the ability to upgrade stars on heroes easier without spending real money. Get 2 to 3 stars on the characters for free leaves me wanting, and im just not spending money on a game like this. Otherwise it is a fun game. Even though it basically can be a full time job you dont make money on and have to spend money on. So if you dont mind commiting months to barely make it to do the late game stuff amd still have to spend months to progress. This game will be great. This review is for those who play ftp games without actually paying to win.",
        "So it's kinda fun but I'm rating it low based on the cost of purchasing character shards versus how many you get. I tested it out and purchased a ton of purple diamond things and purchased character shards that gives between 5 and 330. Out of 7 purchases at 1299 each, I got a total of 41 shards. So for roughly 9100 diamonds, I get 41 shards. You do the math. This game apparently enjoys taking your money. I've mentioned this to the developers with no reply. DC Legends knows what they're doing when it comes to purchases of character shards. At least they make it easier",
        "Very addictive. I started playing casually, and 4 weeks later I find myself checking it all the time. It's best played with at least a minor investment, but reasonably ftp...if you got patience.  Add: it's been six months, and I'm still hammering away at it. It has a huge base of fans,and I've only needed customer support once (and they handled my issue very well and quickly).  Still a bit grind-y, but great little bit of clicky gaming.",
        "This game hooked me up. The community it is very helpfull and growing evryday.Check youtube videos befor you start playing this game because is a griding game and you will need patiance and a good guidance at the start. It is not p2w you can play it as a f2p but you will need patiance so dont worry about money...in this game money will only save you time not exclusive content. 5* from me this is for sure the best mobile game ever. May the force be with you.",
        "The game is fun enough but to sync it with your Google account to have to give your phone and all its abilities to EA. Why is there a need for the game to access my photos and make and answer calls? How 'bout I play a game on my phone with cool light sabers and fun music and when I need to make a call I'll stop for a bit. Just let people play and EA can make bank with their microtransactions. GTFO of people's personal info.",
        "The game is a lot of fun if you are willing to put A LOT of time into grinding things out. They have made huge changes for just quality of life things, but they have kept the core game the same. Grind, grind, grind, grind, and grind some more. You can get everything in the game just by playing it. No need to pay anything. However it would be a lot easier if you could spend 1000$ on the game every couple weeks lol."

        "One way to check how much products I have left is by touching the machine and thr corresponding product but sometimes the game will assume  that you are putting the product into production hence it will put the product into production whether you want it or not so it will waste production time. Sometimes the touch is too sensitive. Sometimes the touch is not sensitive enough which forces me to drag the product into the production slot up to 10 ten times just to start production. I know this feedback is not much but maybe an undo button will help. It makes the gameplay million times difference if you  put your players comfort a priority.",
        "They keep taking my diamonds and telling me I spent them somewhere. Like I spent 19 on fast tracking 1 Coco tree while I have Tom for 6 days and 102 Coco's in my silo then tell me they can't refund it because I'm a liar! They took 50 from my husband and only refunded him 30!! Super cell is ripping players off!!",
        "I buy an axe it will last forever same thing with other tools but here I have to keep buying tools to do the job. An if I need more crop I get the land ready for more seeding get the water. This you have to bring in more people that never show up to do the work. That's why if I'm going to farm I count on one person me. Here you need others. It not for me.",
        "Love this game. My mom and I play it 24/7. It's addicting. Annnd it's a great time killer. Just like everyone else there are things that I would suggest to improve the game. Like for example the time frame for waiting on items. Crazyyyy long. Like the fish nets are like 14hrs! Could drop all the high times to half. That would be cool. But of course if you guys did that then it would be super easy to level up. And you guys would loose out on money cause there are some impatience people out there that just go ahead and buy diamonds and such. Anywho. Love the game. Please consider some of these people's suggestions. Thank you. #HayDayFan",
        "Long time player returning to the game after taking a break. I leveled up to level 41 today. Before leveling up it showed I should get 1 white and 1 black rabbit with the new level but I didn't get either of them. I would also like to see it a bit easier to get wildlife refuge animals. 36 puzzle pieces seems a bit much.",
        "Good game. I initially wrote a one star review because this game was very dependant on microtransactions but it's actually pretty fun if you have the patience. Right off the bat you have to wait upwards to 30 minutes or an hour for basic production and warming but as you grow your farm it gets easier to deal with. This definitely isn't a game you can play for, like, an hour, consecutively, which kinda sucks but it's great for the 10-20 minites you pop in now and then."

It's pretty simple and easy to learn. Newer and f2p players have a bit of a rough go, but you can easily keep pace in this game for less than $100 a year.",
        "It's a fun game for a while before you will get frustating. Too much depending on luck no matter how good your deck is if you couldnt get the card to do your combo its useless againt an opponant that have better draw than you.  Also if you are free to play you have to be petient to get ass kick for a while till you have luck enough to get some useful legend card.",

You can be in a winning position and still lose because of 1 in a 10000000 chance of the oponent getting lucky. Even when I win I feel bad from winning because I know the oponet was unlucky.... It is very rare I get a game where I think. This game was awesome because we both did our best.",

Then it takes too long to reload causing me to lose a turn. This is the worst in arena because losing one turn will kill you and it becomes a waste of gold. Please do whatever you can to solve this problem."

        "The makers of this game have put their soul into it, bringing into life every element of the game. The characters are charming and beguiling. I'm in love with princess. 😁 It's the only game where I've invested real cash, and have received  its full worth. The game is an epic. I love it. Cons: Although I've purchased gems, and bought legendary chests, I've only received relatively less efficient cards like lava hound and graveyard which help in game play only if complemented with other cards. It's a bummer. I think they want me to spend more to enjoy more desirable cards.",
        "I don't think I need to 'review' much here. There are some points I definitely don't like about the game. Such as the matchmaking... You get matched with the same deck type in a row. Other than that and some minor flaws it's a great game. I love the competitive aspect about it.  Finally I would suggest some 2v2 with different game modes, such as ramp up 2v2. Also, add the rematch button in 2v2 challenges with random mates.  Hope I hit the 4,3k this season. Good luck to all clashers!",
        "I think Clash Royale is a great game to play and is very well put together for all ages, it is a fast paced game and at the same time can be played with an individual pace of your own to a degree being that there is a clock ticking, also new characters are released at a well balanced rate, so that the game doesn't become boring and the regular balance of the characters strengths and weaknesses are balanced to make the game more competitive. I recommend this game for all ages and abilities. It's great for a few minutes or an hour or so and this game also has several different tournaments you can enjoy yourself or with a friend or a teammate. See you soon on Clash Royale. A.K.A. Dad.",
        "Supercell, I think your best game is hay day. Clash royale on the other hand isn't one of your better games. Android is better than apple. Why would you ever support apple instead of android. You released Brawl Stars only for apple. You should have less medieval/fantasy games unless you make the knights, princes etc. More realistic. In my opinion I think you're better at making farm and army games. Please make more of those😖",
        "This is the only game of its kind. Many companies try to copy, but this is the original and the best. There are  endless possibilities of card combos and decks that you could use making the game always entertaining. My only complaint is that the trainer is way too easy to beat. It is one of few games that you could get competitive without using your own 💰. I also like how the stuff that u unlock in the beginning does not go to waste later in the game.",
        "What do we do?  I have been playing this game from 9 months now. In these 9 months i got 3 Legendary Cards 2 from chest and 1 from Clan Chest. But the thing is that all of them were Ice Wizard. I'm in Arena 9 from 2 months now Because i dont have the cards to win. I check the tv royale every time i open the Game for a good deck But. So Supercell tell me what do i do? I can't push to Hog Mountain then what do i do in this game? Please do something"

        "Love it.  I kept seeing ads for it and thought it was just another crappy rip off game, but I figured I'd give it a shot, and I'm so glad I did. Game play is fun, there aren't ads every 30 seconds, the app runs smooth, and the artistry that went into designing this game and the characters in it is absolutely flawless. Can't complain at all. Great game, I do recommend to anyone who likes puzzle and strategy games.  10/10!",
        "Awesome game. Sadly motivated by profit grabbing providers. The cost to buy extra lives is astronomical. The only way to buy on a more viable basis was via the piggybank and guess what. They removed it. When I questioned this I got standard fob off bull. I questioned that and guess what no reply. A shame, it is a great addictive game. Just don't get tempted to get you wallet out..........",
        "Zainy!  I can understand the addictivity of it, however, just as I was getting into each level, surprise!, is was completed! This spoilt a bit of the fun for me.  The catchy music, oddly I never got tired of hearing... Great game!!!  This review is after my first experience of the game which I played upto level 20 before stopping.",
        "Sounds boring but I'm loving it! Sucks you right in. Starting to get a little complex (actually using some real brain power) but still very much doable and no charges as of yet and I'm up to level 10 atm. I am no gamer by any means but I'm really enjoying this.",
        "After my anti-matter laboratory had a slight malfunction and destroyed half the houses in my town I discovered that I had a lot of time on my hands. So I discovered Toon Blast. Been busy ever since! Thanks guys",
        "Awesome game! Thanks to the developers for not only making this fun, but doing it in a dignified way (i.e., no annoying ads). I love this game! It's fun, addictive, and challenging enough that it's still entertaining 500 levels in! Love it, can't say enough good things about it."

I payed £2.99 to open the piggy bank to collect my gold bars and when I tried to collect them again, I have a pop up telling me that I have to pay another £2.99 AGAIN to collect the 50 gold bars I have earned from completing each level! Nothing states that these are one off payments and that you have to pay everytime you want to collect your 50 gold bars. I never normally spend money on games and I most certainly will not waste any money on this game again! What an absolute rip off. When a gamer clicks on the piggy bank, I think that the notification should state that you have to pay the ridiculous amount of £2.99 everytime you want to collect your 50 gold bars.",
        "Latest update keeps crashing especially when a level has been won and on the bonus. Crashes to hone screen then the level is lost  and had to be done again. Will restore 5 stars when fixed.",
        "Payments for bricks does not respond with google play . Just says error occurred try later or wrong password. Im already logged in google play atc. I did not make any changes in my account."

For example i just been upgraded to th10, i dont have infernos , i dont have 3rd xbow and im getting maxed out th11 bases to raid in crystal league. Similarly maxed th11 players are raiding my base sucking all my loots with all maxed troops , lvl 50 king/queen and lvl 20 warden...This is because i dont invest money in this game.",
        "Hi COC. I love this game. This my only favourite game. And its the best in the world. I love when there are updated in the game. But I have a query this time. After Builder Hall 8 update whenever I click by boat to go Builder Base the game shuts. I am not able to upgrade my Builder hall. SUPERCELL you are super we know plz fix this issue and let me know. Plz reply to my review. And give interesting offers on normal base. There are no good offers now. I am very happy to be a memner of COC family. ~King SB  Clan~Ganking Geckos",
        "This is a perfect game..but you should give us a short way to make our town hall level 11.. You should give some event everyday.. make tournament.. what you have give us that is like a league not a tournament... Give a tournament Like football world cup.. first there will be group stage.. knock out stage .. that will make this game so much Enjoyable and more and more interesting.. This is a request to you #SUPERCELL PLZ MAKE THIS HAPPEN..THIS WILL MAKE THIS GAME A DREAM GAME.. MAKE IT HAPPEN SUPERCELL.. LOVE YOU",
        "HI SUPERCELL . some players ruined the clan because of Clan Games. Why? They will join ur clan and check if we already achieve the reward like book. They will earn 50 or 100 points and leave the clan. Pls do something about this issue. The CG rules should change like They will get the reward depend of how many points they earnd. Sample: 1500 points they get the reward from tier 1-3 even though the clan achieved the last tier. Pls fix it. Thanks",
        "Super game my favourite game really nice guys download it .I have A small request if we have got any bonus in war or Multiple battles it automatically goes in Clan Castle ,and when we want withdraw it give whole treasure comes out. So if U keep a device ,in which we can type how much  amount of  treasure we want to withdraw. It will be great honor if U put it in next update.",
        "A nice game. I will always be in search of games. My Friend recommend that this is nice game. I installed it. He said that join in my clan. I joined in his clan. Now I am playing this game wonderfully. Thank you super cell and coc. But only the problem is maintainance of server.  It says try again later.  That's why I have rated it 4★. Other wise iwll give 5★. But any way game is wonderful.        PLEASE INSTALL THIS GAME IT'S WONDERFUL GAME"

I can't leave message with development so this is the best I can do about that. But I love the game and this wouldn't change my activity amount at all. Keep up the great work development and look forward to new games in the future.",
        "Best game i played ever. But new update have some bugs like if we going to play with friends it take too much time for loading nd mostly notification pop up that there is an error your coins refunded in your account. Kindly resolve this issue. Except this best game 👍",
        "So I have no idea why I am always at a club disadvantage. My driver is level 5 and always vs a person with level 7 or 8. Why do I never go against level 3 drivers. Always vs higher clubs! ALL THE TIME! you might as well give them the win. Losing me as a customer because there is something very lopsided.",
        "The mechanics of the game are fun, but once you move up a rank or two winning is tough. That is an issue because gold (needed to upgrade) is earned thru even payout bets and very little gold is generated naturally. If you can't keep a high win % you either can't play or need to spend $$$. It's hard to win often when most games come down to closest to the pin shootouts.",
        "Constantly glitching now. Will select an opponent but pictures continually scroll and game never starts. Have to shut game down and start back up for the game to begin. On the verge of uninstalling. Will select opponent and never start game and I end up losing money. Forever downloading, takes forever. I always loved 30 seconds when I start the game up if it doesn't start up by then I just shut it down. Beginning to be very disappointed"

        "great game! auto play is helpful for players who do not have a lot of free time in the real world. eats up battery like a fat kid at a buffet.   not worth downgrading a star but I noticed there is no audio mute option, just turn down volume bar as far to the left. So when you start the game app the first time, the intro audio blasts in your face! after you log into your account, game play is silent.",
        "It's been ok so far, I personally don't enjoy the auto feature but I get why it's there... I'm a busy person I have other stuff to do while I really want to game. Of course, the pay2play option is there otherwise you grind like ALL mmorpgs. Which I don't see the problem with... it's a free game ppl and a pretty decent one at that.",
        "Not only is it laggy, now after loading and installing the recent update, I can't even log in. After log in screen and after it checks for any update, it logs me out to main menu! This is ridiculous! After spending real money with this game you deny me access? So!ution required please asap.",
        "After update, not able to log in. Game crashes all before loging in. Either you fix it today, either i will demand for money return. I have payed money, not to be unable to log in. Do it today, or return money payed.  Since you have not attempted to fix the issue, i demand full refund for the purchases i made. Expect refund and reply! You HAVE to give any reply.",
        ".... Like the 100 or more people before me after the March 14th update I'm no longer able to log in for some unknown reason.. No info on the netmarble site about this issue which is odd.. I actually liked this game but this is really nad customer support.. Well time for a new time sink I guess..",
        "Game is a decent time waster. It's true that it is tedious if you're not willing to blow an inhuman amount of money. The recent update is causing the login screen to be unresponsive to my touch, and I cannot log on. Not terrible otherwise.. Samsung galaxy s8 active."

        "Excellent card game.  However as soon as you get passed reasonably priced starter packs you cannot play the game and why not?  Because you play two games then you need to spend huge amounts of money so you can play two more rounds.  Then you need good cards and guess what you have to buy them through a lottery system like gambling highly addictive but after maybe thousands of dollars you get the card you want guess what you need to evolve your card and guess what you need to buy your reagents big dough yet again.  Then when you have spent all your hard earned cash you need to buy special weapons to give yourself a good boost to your cards.  Do you get where this game and a right game it is too. It relies on you getting addicted so you spend all your time and resources on an endless quest for something you will never have uninstalled buy buy.",
        "Amazing game, honestly, top 3 mobile game I've ever played, found an amazing guild and it's loads of fun. No paywall is the crowning achievement in my opinion. One thing, cause I don't know where customer support is, I started a Path of Champion level, and  on the first wave the game crashed and when I logged back on I had no key and didn't have a chance to beat the level",
        "Definitely pay to win. When you scroll up or down it thinks you are clicking on something. Stamina is a nightmare as when you reach a high enough level that takes more xp to level up, you can't play for hours as it takes to long to recharge. Should make gems easier to get for non paying players so it is more fair. Other than that pretty good.",
        "Number one of the best games I have ever played on my phone. I'm watching ads for bonus experience when sacrificing my cards. And I love the fact of that availability. Especially since it pays them which increases chances of more games like this one. Keep up the great work. Really helping my cognitive development of pattern recognition",
        "Great games. Controls suck.  You want to scroll and click a card instead (i know how to swipe) turns are fast paced..sometimes too fast. And as a starter...some of the turn challenges seem a bit unrealistic with the characters provided. Almost like they want to have you spend money off rip. Good game overall....but some things should definitely need work.",
        "It's a lot other games of this type. I haven't been able to find a problem with it yet. Great graphics although the timer is a bit fast when you're looking up connections. If you had a button that the players would push when they couldn't find any more connections, that would be great!"

        "I really love this game, i've been playing it for nerely 5 years now and although it can be hard to progress without paying money it is possible. I am free to play which can make it hard but for the people that are not willing to pay money igg is there for you, every week i can earn up to 1500 gems which is probably the reason i have yet to quit. Other than that the leveling and many heros makea the game that much better.",
        "I up my rating to 4. After playing 5 years, this game is really fun to play. I cannot give 5 star as i still having issues with the gem price too crazy expensive. Hope igg can revise gem price back, so many player can support this game, not the rich guy only. I believe you guys has realise many p2p player already quit, so better to revise the germ price again. Overall, i love this game^^",
        "Decided to edit my review to clear things up for people that says this is a money making scheme etc. To the people that say that, do u understand that this game is Free? The devs spend a ton of money making a game enjoyable for people, adding new content such as, new heroes, new events, new upgrading features etc. It's only normal to lock some heroes behind a paid service, and the heroes behind the pay wall isn't even game changing or op. U don't have to spend a cent on this game to make progress. Rolling heroes takes time but it's so rewarding when u get that one hero u were looking for. This is a great game and if u complain about ingame purchases for a game so well maintained then rather go play another free game full of bugs and zero updates.",
        "Holy cow, sitting at 100k might but leveling goes so slow now. Please do something, and new quary is really annoying and sitting in the way.  Edit: everytime I open the game through notification is doesn't load the game.",
        "I hate it. It's always connected to those fake link downloads ugh and if i donwload this game and run it for 30 seconds, the link will open BUT NO it's a lie. This game just wants to be seen as a game with millions of downloads and I HATE IT."

They give daily prizesand makes thou wsnt to come back. It can be frustratingly challenging and that is a hood thing.. thank you creators.",
        "Ok new review, I've passed all 1740 levels would have given 5 stars but the upper levels can only be passed when you hit the right program! Play same level 20-30+ times then suddenly pass with 10-15 moves left!!! Not fun anymore!!! Uninstalled",
        "This game was my favorite, however the lack of being able to reset the game is truly sad 😢 and takes away from my joy of the game! Please give the option for us to reset our play easily, please 💕",
        "Can you sponsor a video for me? I've introduced this game to several people and I have yet to hear it be exposed on youtube. As a creator I can give the game the exposure it deserves.",
        "The recent changes to the game bother me, you can no longer see how many points you get as you go or when you fail. Now it seems that they limit the amount of points you can get at the end for the moves you have left. The only time you see points is the total at the very end. Seems like they're screwing the people who want to get 3 stars on the levels...",
        "I enjoyed playing this game but I was to reset game to beginning.Tried clearing data and cache but didn't work.E-mailed developers to ask them and they e-mailed back saying they would but only once which I am still waiting for them to do.What is the big deal about wanting to start over the game again?Better that than once getting to levels you can't do to not play game again surely!!!!"

        "It really  depends on the game and how much effort the creator put into it. My favourite  game is Elemental Battlegrounds. Itwas created this year and the creator clearly put a bunch of time in making it. I love Roblox and most of the games on it. At least it it's a 3.9 out of5.",

As more and more packages got released into the game it became a pay to win situation. I personally do not think spending $100+ on a phone game is a wise investment. Thus I enjoyed the game by taking advantage of their events and the prizes within the game. However, it has become dominated by people who payed to be the big guy and the little people get absolutely demolished. It has taken the fun out of playing, which really dissapoints me as it was a fun game to play.",
        "This game has potential to be fun but it's completely ruined because IT'S COMPLETELY PAY-TO-WIN which sucked the fun out of the game that I quit. Don't get me wrong, Final Fantasy is highly respected RPG franchise because it's full of great games in the series. But no this one.  However, I might come back if the game developers make it not as pay-to-win as it is now. Right now, it's a complete money bucket!",
        "This game is great and fun, I love spending my time playing this game. One problem though, what is going on with the packages? Why is it every time a package is bought all the packages go from 20 to 100 dollars ? We should be able to buy the 20 dollar packages more than once! Is that fixable? Please cuz i do want to keep playing but 100 dollars is too much.",
        "The game is very addictive and fun to play. Some of the people playing the game are wonderful and fun to game with. Graphics are very good for a on line game played on phone, tablet or computer. The quests are challenging at best. BUT!!! BE WARNED... This game is not for young children as there is explicit language and cut throat people playing the game. After all it is a war game and nothing more. Now down to the nitty-gritty of the game. Yes it's free, but that only get you so far before you will need to buy packs in the game to advance and unlock the two new characters. The game quests are designed for people to spend if you want to get ahead fast. Large amounts of  $$$$$$ Cash are needed to play this game. $$$$$$ Personal note, I know people who have spent thousands on this game. Over all the game is great for young adults on up. PG-15",
        "I absolutely LOVE my guild!!! Everyone is so cool,from all over the States & all over the world...have friends in other guilds as well from all over the world...my guild is like my \"family\"...some of us have even talked about meeting up with each other...I hope to finally meet some of my favorite people,especially our guild leader...we're like the best of friends!!! Although,he lives in TX & I'm from Michigan,we're both married ,but there's nothing I wouldn't do for him!!! Thanks so much for giving me this opportunity to meet such wonderful people!! Lifelong friends/family!!! 💜"

        "Ok so ive been olaying this game for a long time now, but I had to delete the game for storage purposes. Once I game back I logged in with my facebook account and all that but nothing loads. Which is fine I just have to wait. But now my issue is that the actual levels for the wedding event, and the normal quest, it kicks me out of the app and it does thatt every time. Please fix this issue. Maybe then Ill give it five stars.",
        "Great addictive game! Starts out cute and innocent. Recently found out through a spoiler thread that it does take a darker turn in Ch 15. The U.S. servers are currently only on Ch 12. Still a great addicting game that many players start out thinking \"Awesome! A great game that I don't I can have the option to play for free!\" Soon they cave when that ONE outfit comes along that they HAVE TO HAVE lol.",
        "I love this game! It's really good for creative people who like to design their own outfits. I just downloaded on my new phone and started over (I don't have Facebook to link my progress with). Please make it available to link with Google play so I don't always lose progress!   Also, since downloading again, I found that some of the names are different... I was very confused, since the voice over still says the old names. I like Yoko way better than Bobo!!",
        "I loved this game, and am V8. So its not like I am against paying. I am against the ranking event especially since you devs LIED TO YOUR PLAYERS and said we wont be getting one again. We will not pay 100s for a non guarenteed reward. It would be more HONEST, if you set up the suits as 300 USD each recharge.  If you are smart at all, devs you should understand that business ethics is just as important as profit and will benefit everyone in the long run.",
        "Lovely game! Gorgeous clothes and gameplay. A little cheesy in. The story but fairly creative for a dress up game. Plus it can be hilarious with how wild the lore gets around fashion. Design can be a little overcrowded sometimes but everything is coordinated so it still looks nice. Backgrounds are gorgeously painted. Tutorial is easy to understand but isnt too tedious. I am officially addicted",
        "I never write reviews, but this game deserves all the praise possible. Downloaded it for my niece and turns out I am the one addicted!! I'm a daily player now and love the fact that you can start your own group for 300 gems and approve applications and interact with your stylist association members. That aspect took the game to a whole new level. The clothing is beautiful and the attention to detail is great!!! Give it a shot and you just may become addicted like myself. I do spend around 20 bucks a week, but it was just as much fun before I was spending money, I just wanted the special clothes for events."

        "The game sets a new high standard in bland average. THE DEAL ISN'T TRUE TO LIFE, IN ALMOST EVERY SINGLE HAND DEALT (in tournaments) THERE IS MULTIPLE ACES & PICTURE CARDS. However for a poker fan that doesn't know this game it's worth the gamble lol. The game play is good, poor player avatar customisation options as it's simply a small selection of picture options with zero options for using one's social media profile pic. This means frequently there are multiple players with the same profile pic. It struggles a bit as a social game of cards because conversation is limited by time, you can sit at slower tables allowing for better chat but not in tournaments. It has nothing to stand it out & above other poker game apps for either negative or positive reasons. If you just want to play a game of poker with random people from around the planet though it won't disappoint. It does give the option to buy top up chips and a daily option to get chips for free from both in game buddies and a poker machine. From the entertainment point of view it ticks all the right boxes but it's not the best poker game on Google's app store. If it was food you'd spit it out because it's bland, not sweet nor spicy but porridge without sugar or sweeteners.",
        "Its a good game but the rewards for tickets are rubbish , last 6 times i claimed gold reward for 1000% more cash , its given less than 200,000 which is rubbish get more for the bronze , needs sorting",

        "Lots of fun. Unfortunately, the other day I had to do a factory reset on my phone. When I installed Design Home afterwards, all of my designs, progress...all of the money I've spent on the game for over a year was/ is gone. It created a totally different designer number (profile) for me. It wasn't connected to my Facebook for privacy reasons, but now? I don't know if I can keep playing, if I have to start all the way over. If you want to play, you'd better link it to Facebook.",
        "This is an awesome game.  Especially since I love decorating.   Few things though,  how about pillows on the plain sofas, modern pictures for modern furniture,  traditional scones, etc, for traditional designs, and more diamonds or stop using extra sofas and expenses that take away our diamonds. We need more accessories for the tables like books, vases, and flowers, also how about some better pictures because your choices are by far not worth $1000.00.  Last but not least, more colors in furniture with two or three toned designs.  That's what designers look for.  Thank you! Still love the game.",
        "The game is addictive. I wish that we could see who we are up against in the voting to better understand the rating we receive. It would be great if we had the chance to buy limited accessories 1 more time. I love the new challenges that we have received in the last few weeks. I've noticed every time you make an update that I have lost some furniture why? I do not like that you have increased the dollar value of buying the highest amount of gems. I won't buy again. Losing intrerest real fast.   Thanks again.",
        "I still love this game! However I have yet to change my mind about the fact that it takes longer to vote just for 3 stars at a time, than to actually design the max of 5 designs per day. Can you not increase stars won per vote? Can you not make designs brief even more compulsory as many designers dont follow the brief and you just end up losing votes because your design is too colourful or eclectic",
        "I super loved this game and I am glad tapjoy is back.  I just have an issue lately.  I completed an offer lately but never got rewarded.  It says it might take 24 hours for the submit button to appear so I can contact customer support but it's been 3 days now and it still says pending.  I have no other way to report it.  Please look into this. Voting is an issue but it's the players who are voting and they vote for whatever they think has a better design no matter if they follow the requirements, you can only use a furniture for a limited time and will have to purchase it again if you want it.  I understand those things but I hope the reward for every design completed is higher than 500 so we''ll have more to spend and make the furniture more affordable.  Otherwise, this app is one of the best!",
        "I love this game concept. I also like the \"borrow\" option but I don't have anyone to borrow from because everyone I know stops playing because it's too difficult to advance (achieve 5 stars, which is the quickest and nearly impossible way to do so. Impossible because your advancement is based on user preference). A \"sort by price\" filter would also be cool for those of us who enjoy this game but are on a limited budget."

        "I like it.   The fish are friendly and encouraging.  I use the game to help me keep calm and relax.  Please consider allowing us to select another of one of the earlier aquariums when we get to the point where we are waiting for new aquariums to be developed and have finished everything.  I'd like a place to put new fish and decorations, but none of the old fish want to be sold.  They are still my favorite friends.  The game uses a lot of memory, and I had to uninstall it from my tablet because it kept making it crash.  Works on my phone, but it's still a lot of memory.",
        "Love this game!! I love the challenge with completing levels. There's days I can't get enough of this game. I play every day. I love decorating my tanks. I love when I get infinite time, but It would be nice if we had control over when to use it or the time would stop and be saved for when we return. Sometimes 6 hours is impossible to sit there and just play. One thing that would be nice is if we didn't have to wait 30 mins for a life to renew and could have more friends to  receive more lives and got to use the diamonds we earned amd not be stored in a bank to buy. Other than that I cant complain😉 best game out there and I highly recommend it to all ages.",
        "It's a great game. I play it with my daughter on our freetime it's quite addictive. Its great that you get rewards if you have to watch the movies. The only thing i would change is the reloding of the lives. Half an hour for one life is too long. Every so often you get a few free hours, but you need to have free time to play.I love the fact that we can play using my phone sideways (landscape ) as I have a problem with my wrist. I highly recommend it!",
        "Fishdom is a fun game.  The puzzles are challenging. I would love to see a change to the gifts we can give our neighbors . Such as, the lightening, or fireworks, or an ornament for their aquarium. I would also like to see the diamonds we earn to be available, not stuck in a bank, to be paid for.  Limits could be put on it, of course, but the free one here and there only help once in any puzzle sequence.   Overall, though, its a nice game.",
        "I love this game I just wish it was more interactive with the fish in one's tank. Like when you pet them little hearts appear and one can earn happiness points with so many touches. I also wish that one could still earn something for previous tanks. I have no real reason to visit my first and second tank. I don't earn anything for more decorations and it doesn't get dirty and the fish don't get hungry. I feel bad for them, but I focus on my current tanks.",

The AI will always take advantage of beating you with moves that will take what you need 98% of the time. Moves that no one can see but magically the AI knows what to choose to beat you. I love strategy games, but cheating is not a fun for anyone. The AI compition is not a compition. It's a slaghter waste of time until you get lucky or they give it too you. No strategy there. Just piss you off cheating AI. Being the top of Candy Crush and Candy crush soda. And yes also Jelly. It is ridiculous sometimes to waste my time with this one. If the AI opponents played at the highest level of what to use, then I wouldn't mind getting beaten. But when you watch the AI make the dumbest move to get what it needed, tells you that the AI sees the whole board. Even what is hidden. Give up or beat yourself up on this one.

Watch the number counter not the monklings going under the rope & u will see the counter not go pass a certain number! THE SAME NUMBER continues like 6 will stay 6 4x's! That way u don't beat the level & u have to buy a booster, KING Co are CHEATS!",

That means you can progress through it without even spending a dime. Its a simple game with decent graphics to play at leisure and has become my current pass time.  Update 3/22/18  I decreased my rating to three stars (from 5) until the developer can correct the latest flop from most recent update. Flop regards being able to log in but paralyzed from any action that requires an in game pop up. I including the \"Help\" module which is used to contact dev with. If no improvement after a week, I will delete game and draw stars to 0.",

Like if you want to make it a real life interaction type style, you should probably fix it to where the actions are more real and not computerized. I would like the option to do more with my kid sims, like more clothes options.  I also dont like the fact that when your sim retires, yoy no longer have control over them. Yhat jind of sucks. Alot...but Keep up the good work. Thanks!",
        "PLEASE  HELP!!!!! So i uninstalled and reinstalled the game in my phone but there is no prompt that ask me if i wanna continue my progress when i play it again and it seems that im link to my google play (bacause there is no option to link it in the settings) but i still start back from the very beginning. And didn't really recovered my previous game. Love everything except for this.  P.S. i did the troubleshooting in the forum but nothing really helps.",
        "Edit: I just had my latest infant boy \"evolve\". My question is, why did you all give me a caucasian kid when my family is black? My other 2 kids are black too! I don't mind (since he's here lol) but this is odd.     I love this game! Already have 2 kiddos and a big house!",
        "So after about a week of gameplay there are some things that I think can be improved upon. I understand this is not the computer version so automated actions are probably not going to be included. I feel like when I'm done using a product such as getting married, I should be able to return those items and get at least half my money back. I noticed that when I'm deleting items I'm not getting anything back and then item is completely gone.   This review won't be all negative though. I really like how you can meet different people from different countries, and chat with them via parties. I think the ducky bucks function sucks. And while I can understand the effort that was made when creating all these different tickets, I think it's just too much",
        "I've always been a fan of The Sims since it first came out on the PC and now this version is WAY BETTER than their other App game! I LOVE IT! It's so much fun and I can't wait to see what more is in store! UPDATE: After playing longer and being able to have a baby with my spouse, I found that our kids are labeled son and daughter under his family tree, but as father and niece under mine. That makes no sense! What's going on?!",
        "One of the best mobile games I have played. Not forced to buy anything with real money to keep playing, the cupcakes are great, I love everything. Right now, this is funner than Sims 4! My only complaint is that you can't change the story with another sim. I would love if once a story is complete, you could choose to pick another one. After all, relationships change over time in real life. Love this game!"

Why have a cloud save or play the game or spend moo pney when it's erased. I still love the game but now frustrated I will think about uninstalling.",
        "The puzzles are interesting, the animations are generally enjoyable. It quickly becomes a grind, though, where you aren't enjoying the gameplay, you're just trying to get past the timewasters of the daily challenge, or fighting the arbitrary points of the arena. The clan battles and Mighty Eagle challenge are the best parts, but you can't play them all the time. You have to grind away in the Arena.",
        "I just purchased a new phone. And being I'm using the same e-mail address i would have thought it would have started me at the same level I had been on prior to the new phone. Kinda sucks because i had spent a near fortune and was at level 64 ! Unless they can fix this I will remove the game for good. I mean I had every hat except the ones that cost 25,000. Now I'm at zero!",
        "RESUBMITTED: Arena games were sucked up by those high-card players or maybe cheaters. My power cards are the same, just like my opponent, or higher than my opponent's cards. When I slinging those piggies or blocks, it gives me lower points like 4 hundred thousand. But if my opponent slinging them all, it gives higher points like 7.5 million. I lost my winning streaks so I had to play again but it gives me same points so I lost again, sadly. I thought your arena games are really much fun, but they're not.",
        "GAH! They've over complicated this game with unnecessary graphics and gifts and prizes etc. I couldn't even figure out how to get into the levels for a while haha. I'm sure if I had the patience to go through and understand it properly it would be fine, but I didn't want to. Old angry birds setup was better. Wish you didn't change it. Uninstalled after 1 day.",
        "Classic gameply bogged down by aggravating fremium distration. Havent run into any energy bars yet and already on second world. New birds add interesting gameplay elements but spells are an automatic win that add no semse of achievement besides skipping a hard level. If you want some classic angry birds but dont mind clicking through to get to it then give this a download."

Deducting credits may not the good way to discipline afk players. Its good if no one's lose or gain star either win or not. Make it the game not counted so players not waist time to pursue the game. I'll give 5 stars if 5 theres improvement. Thanks!",
        "MOBA with analog is really a big joke. The graphics is trashy. Hero and skin are hard to unlock. There's a kind of in game power up that could be bought with real money. The only reason this game has so many player is the game size & device compatibility. If your phone is capable of playing \"the famous 3v3 moba\", you'd better play that game",
        "This game is so cool. Only noob will say it hard to play or hard getting hero/skin. Maintain the gameplay and everything will be alright. Sometimes we win and sometime we won't. Only the graphics need to be improve. Come on! It's 2018 already! Make a tournament cause i wanna join!!. (Give me free skin. I give u  5 stars bitchhhhhhhh)",
        "Why don't you try real super hero characters that we know like from dc anime etc such as. Dragon ball naruto bleach justice league avengers try doing it new heroes are good but if there are some like worldwide famous heroes also then it would sound much more  interesting",
        "I love this game, I've been playing this for over a year and I still play it daily! All the skins and heroes skills are amazing. But please don't  let me team up with low level players it's affecting my game and stats when I'm trying my best to carry they would just afk which can be frustrating. But overall it's a good game",
        "I hv been playing this game for two years alll good perfect game perfect graphics..bt there should be some changes for the afk players... strict steps should be taken towards for these afk players not bye lowering credit score by banning from game for a period of time so that they won't be spoiling game any further"

    "descriptionHTML" : "Join your friends in a brand new 5v5 MOBA showdown against real human opponents, Mobile Legends: Bang Bang! Choose your  favorite heroes and build the perfect team with your comrades-in-arms! 10-second matchmaking, 10-minute battles. Laning, jungling, tower rushing, team battles, all the fun of PC MOBAs and action games in the palm of your hand! Feed your eSports spirit!<br><br>Mobile Legends: Bang Bang, 2017&#x2019;s brand new mobile eSports masterpiece. Shatter your opponents with the touch of your finger and claim the crown of strongest Challenger!<br><br>Your phone thirsts for battle!<br><br><b>Features:</b> <br><br><b>1. Classic MOBA Maps, 5v5 Battles</b> <br>Real-time 5v5 battles against real opponents. Fight over 3 lanes to take the enemy&#x2019;s tower. 4 jungle areas. 18 defense towers. 2 Wild Bosses. Complete reproductions of classic MOBA maps. Full-on 5v5, Human vs. Human battles. A triumphant return to genuine MOBA gameplay.<br><br><b>2. Win with Teamwork &amp; Strategy</b> <br>Block damage, control the enemy, and heal teammates! Choose from Tanks, Mages, Marksmen, Assassins, Supports, etc. to anchor your team or be match MVP! New heroes are constantly being released!<br><br><b>3. Fair Fights, Carry Your Team to Victory</b> <br>Just like classic MOBAs, there is no hero training or paying for stats. Winners and losers are decided based on skill and ability on this fair and balanced platform for competitive gaming. Play to Win, not Pay to Win.<br><br><b>4. Simple Controls, Easy to Master</b> <br>With a virtual joystick on the left and skill buttons on the right, 2 fingers are all you need to become a master! Autolock and target sifting allow you to last hit to your heart&#x2019;s content. Never miss! And a convenient tap-to-equip system lets you focus on the thrill of battle!<br><br><b>5. 10 Second Matchmaking, 10 Minute Matches</b> <br>Matchmaking only takes 10 seconds, and battles last 10 minutes, glossing over the quiet early-game leveling up and jumping right into intense battles. Less boring waiting and repetitive farming, and more thrilling action and fist-pumping victories. At any place, at any moment, just pick up your phone, fire up the game, and immerse yourself in heart-pounding MOBA competition.<br><br><b>6. Smart Offline AI Assistance</b> <br>In most MOBAs, a dropped connection means hanging your team out to dry, but with Mobile Legends: Bang Bang&#x2019;s powerful reconnection system, if you get dropped, you can be back in the battle in seconds. And while you&#x2019;re offline, your character will be controlled by our AI system to avoid a 5-on-4 situation.<br><br>PLEASE NOTE! Mobile Legends: Bang Bang is free to download and play, however some game items can also be purchased for real money. If you do not want to use this feature, please set up password protection for purchases in the settings of your Google Play Store app. Also, under our Terms of Service and Privacy Policy, you must be at least 12 years of age to play or download Mobile Legends: Bang Bang.<br><br><b>Contact Us</b> <br>You can get customer service assistance via the [Contact Us] button in the game to help you with any problems you may encounter while playing.

        "This game is pretty good and nintendo/IS takes in community feedback. This is probably one the most generous of any gacha game out right one and there have been some powerful units given to us for free. Content is 99% free to play friendly with only 1 or so events that were very difficult for f2p. While its not a true fire emblem game, it is still pretty good for a mobile game.  P.S. there are some 5 star units that shouldn't be there. They are only there to gimp you out of another unit.",
        "If you ever were interested in the Fire Emblem series then this is defenitely a good place to start off. It's simplistic enough for new players yet at the same time it offers a lot of possibilities on how to build your units. It's fun to collect Heroes in this game and it's fun working on them to make their stats and strategy better. Each Hero has a fun personality and each one of them is well drawn by talented artists.  A fun strategy game that also can get really challenging in some of the harder quests.",
        "Great game. I've never played Fire Emblem before, so this app is a great way to see what the games are like and all about. I like all of the cool characters and all the details each one has. If you like RPGs or want to try one out, this one may be a good one to give a shot at. You don't need money to play either. You might just want to get yourself into the FE games series after playing this. ;)",
        "Been having this app for a year now and yet I haven't thought its a waste of space at all! It's extremely addicting and makes you want to play more. Its also nice how the creators interact with the community alot and listen to our feedback. Its also nice to have a game that's constantly worked on and it just keeps improving. The art and the voice acting it also a big pro for this game. It really does capture the characters personality,even if it is a few words. The art is simply amazing. I appreciate the artists for thier hard work. Would definitely recommend it if you like RPG games.",
        "Turn based strategy rpg. If you've never played a Fire Emblem, time to remedy that. Fantastic depth and graphics for a free game. This feels like a full blown complete Nintendo title I'd expect to see for $30 for Gameboy brand new. At the price of nothing, everyone should try it.",
        "This is a work in progress. I am a huge fan of Fire Emblem, Sacred Stones and I really wanted to love this right out of the gate.  It has made a good start.  All maps are a set size, something like 6x8, with two teams of 4.  No terrain bonuses, no special conversation where one of your characters can convince one of them to join you, ALL attacks result in hits of a predetermined amount, no crits/no misses, no permadeath.  Voiced characters are a nice plus from the old GBA days. This is as close to a real Fire Emblem game as a mobile, free to play will get, and the devs keep changing up stuff to keep it interesting. Great game!"

Hope they fix it or I'll have no choice but to uninstall. Not keeping a game I can't play do to some unprofessional error on the games part",

However anyone who wants to play a final fantasy game, but find that the amount of things you can do and how to do these things is overwhelming, then this is the game for you. Nice mix of old school graphics and slightly more modern 3d graphics, good storyline and funny dialogue. Big fan !",

        "Great game. Everything you could want in a game. Castle building, PvP. Unique equipment with special stats. Different attack types, economy classes. Rewards are rewarding enough. So far 5/5. The theme is good. The balance seems reasonable. My only suggestion is making to character limit for name changes bigger for the dwellers/subjects. Only thing I can constructively suggest. Or be able to type first and last name.",
        "Love the concept of the game but the moment you start reaching higher castle lvl  that's when you realize that if you don't pay you will be on a long journey, ie.. PvP are out of the question everyone has minimum of 5 epic items, arena you will have to settle for 5th or less place due to power lvl difference. I am about 141000 fighting 190000 or 90000, which is not fair for those of low power or advantage to those of high.",
        "After playing for a few hours this I find this game good my only problem is that you need to pay for those epic drops? I mean in a game if you defeated the boss those are supposed to be yours without paying, I can accept paying for 1 dollar but the second boss requires me to purchase it for almost $3 I already paid for premium I don't want to pay for other things. Please make the drops free for premium members or have them cheap or totally free, or else after my premium I'll quit this game.",
        "I loved this game very much, I had a lot of really nice things and invested nearly $60 dollars into making my guys 5 stars and diamonds and other level up promos... I was the clan leader of the \"Bananna Kings\" my main complaint is my phone rebooted and now I've lost everything... my game, my victories, my clan, and all the money I invested in this great game... please help. ;( my username on my good account is \"Skylark\"",
        "Loved playing the game, I just wish there was a balance in the PvP Tournaments, can't find a tournament where everyone else isn't 20000 Points over my guys. Please fix this!! Just put a bloody +/-5000 points deviation on it! Make it more enjoyable for people who don't buy everything they see",
        "best game on mobile i think. just make sure your account is linked to your facebook and google play so you dont ever lose your account i almost lost everything when my phone broke. luckly i got it to turn on for a bit before going off and linked my accounts. now im fine.."

        "I like the game its fun and engaging but the premium choices cost a lot of diamonds and you don't get a lot opportunity to earn them. 12- 18 diamonds for more then a couple  choices in a story to make interesting choices that wouldmake the storys better but you only earn 1 diamond a chapter witch you have to wait an hour or more to unlock or buy keys.  So you pretty much have to spend real money for this game to really enjoy it. Ill be deleting this app not worth my time.",
        "While the game is enjoyable and the stories are intriguing, it is way too expensive to make certain choices. There is absolutely no need for choices to cost 20 or 25 diamonds when you only get 1 diamond for each chapter completed.  This game is in no way good enough to warrant spending real money on it, especially considering the ridiculously high prices of making certain choices which would require making a purchase in every single chapter.",
        "The game is great. Great graphics, nice music, perfectly cued entrees  for new characters, amazing story line.... But they don't give you enough keys or diamonds. I mean, y s its understandable that the chapters are long but 2hrs for a recharge on keys? Really? Either make the waiting time shorter, give us more, or both. Now as for the diamonds, they give you 25 of them. But each special choices is always way to much. And you never really know when your going to need them for something serious. With that said either give us more keys, lower the cost of the choice, or give us more diamonds per chapter. Not like 2 but 5 or more.",
        "It's a brilliant app, though sometimes I wish there wasn't as many gem choices. I fully considered buying gems until I realised how quickly they'd be used.   My favourite story was It Lives In The Woods, though most of the choices are gem choices. The story itself is fantastic, and I love the diversity of characters.   I had a problem with a story playing up and after a chat with the team was told to restart it. I didn't mind but I didn't get any keys to compensate what I'd already spent (I don't buy them I just wait for then to recharge, but it did mean I had to respend keys on one story because of a issue out of my control)   Overall its a great app and highly playable without spending.",
        "Diamond choices come up way too often for how much they cost and how little you get. The keys have an unreasonably long cooldown to get them. Options like watching ads to get diamonds would be a great option, especially seeings how you have that option in HSS and HU:RS. All that aside its a good game. Lots of the stories are enjoyable and its visually pleasing.",
        "Great graphics and great stories. Right now they have like 30 \"books\", so there are lots of options. I've been playing since 2016 and the app just keeps getting better. Can get a little pricey for the preminum choices, but otherwise it's a fantastic app; very additive and entertaining"

        "Repetitive game that requires a lot of thinking. Quite addictive as I've been playing for nearly year and half now. I didn't spend a penny on game but quite a lot of time. Its very difficult to be very good without spending real cash but it's possible. You can watch adverts for coins, so be patient and play. The more you play the more you get. You don't need top characters to have great team - you can create great team with average characters if you focus on weapons. Get yourself into a good team, hit faction's minimums and you'll become great.",
        "There are good and bad aspects of this game, but the pros out weigh the cons. You can absolutely level up incredibly high without spending a single penny on this game. You just need patience. One of the funniest aspects of this game is its long term playability. There is always something to do every day and in the long run it all adds up to your benefit.  My only complaint is the pop up windows when you first get on. They show you you've been raided...then you have the notification that you have to check that gives you the same info. If the pop up already gives me the info, why do I still have notifications?",
        "Rubbish repetitive game. After spending ten's of thousands pointlessly I can tell you honestly... don't waste your time or money. It's a very addictive cash cow and just a very smart way to take your money and keep you hooked. Scopely has repeatedly lied and will continue to do so. You have been warned",
        "Ive been playing this for 2 years, love it but support is well below standard. I have a problem just now where it crashes every 5 mins and support do nothing. Its become unplayable. Avoid if you have a samsung device",
        "The game has slowly been turning more p2w than ever before. Before 6 stars had come into play, you could easily get any 5 stars. Even some p2w toons were able to be accessed later on in some events. With 6 stars, this really isn't the case. This has also caused the Road to Survival community to become more toxic and started making the game unfair/not fun for other players.",
        "I like the strategy involved in playing the game. The only thing I think I would change is when you kill an enemy and he comes back to life,  they should come back as a zombie. .not keep all their ability before death. .otherwise it keeps you interested."

Aces, review by Da1 G Reaper of the Sun Tzu Ghosts Gaming Community... #livfreeplyhard #STGGC",
        "Good luck in this game if ya don't want to spend money. No game balancing meaning a lvl12 can attk lvl  1 with no post attk shield or protection of any kind. Got attk 12 times in a row by same player of higher lvl. Also If you have issues with game content good luck getting a good answer on that too.",
        "Hi A.K server 52. Have been playing for couple of months now and still love the game.just when you think you are on top of things something new comes up. I personally like the challenge and new changes.for those who have not played this game before I would recommend it.  Very addictive. If you are going to spend money in this game spend wisely.",
        "After last update, this game getting worst, score for pirate event has been reduced, and the pirate getting stronger.. fix it fast.. many player complaining about this Nick : Premi06 Server : 041",
        "Please add more vessels like USS Carl Vinson, and enabled to play offline too. And please make no time limits to purchase for the new promotion with a cheap price such as new ships or aircrafts, when that happened I bet there will be more interesting. Thanks.",
        "If you don't have money to burn then don't play this game. This game is the embidiment of the 'pay to win' phrase and would make EA look like a baby when it comes to that. Levels are easy to scale up in the beginning but as you cross level 10 through 20, you'd realise that without paying through your nose, you are just fodder for paying players. Don't be a sheep they'd like you to be. On top of that, the game is riddled with bugs and the developers are unresponsive, unless again you are a paying player. Do yourself a favor and Invest your time in another game."

I am in the 3rd stage and i went to update the game as it keeps freezing, and now I'm back at 115! And if i read the reviews here i am not the only one that has this problem. And seems you guys don't care. I will defnitely rate this minus 1!!!! 28.12.2017",
        "Submitted a report yesterday and you made out I was lying. I've submitted 2 reports since then with no reply.  When I pass a level my ticket count is not going up I'm now at the gate that is telling me I need a 100 tickets its pointless me going over other levels as the ticket has not increased. I was told to tell you when I'm at the gate, which I have done twice. Still ignored.  I really likes the game until this happened.",
        "A fantastic match-3 game for all ages. Kudos to the creator of this game. How about coming out with a Rio 2: Match 3 Party? I'm not even close to the end on this one, if there is an end.  Just asking basically if it had been thought about. More levels are great too, with more birds. Love these critters. Thanks!!!",
        "Haven't been able to play for 2 weeks. Submitted report after report and nothing has been done to fix the problem. Not very user friendly. Have full Wifi so that's not the problem. All my other games work great. No thanks. I shouldn't have to jump through hoops to play a game. Delete.",
        "Love this cute and challenging game but with all of these types there should be an option to turn off auto hints.. Really annoying and I like to figure out the next move myself.. Same thing with the constant tutorial, match 3 isn't rocket science... Otherwise great job!!!",
        "GREAT GAME, ADDICTIVE, LOVE IT!!!!!! HOWEVER, I have completed the first 2 locations, got the tickets that I need to proceed on the third location, but the game won't load the other levels... It keep saying i need atleast 77 tickets... I have 120 of them. I have uninstalled & reinstalled the game THREE TIMES but I am STILL stuck waiting. FIX THIS ASAP, PLEASE"

I just wish the skill and stat descriptions gave more detail. I had to dig through the forum and googls to find info (if any) of certain stat and skill effects. Overall fun game.",
        "I dont know if it has PVP.. Im still starting to explore this.. so far, I like it.. It's just the skill is somehow hard to click as you need to click the list first.. It would be really great if it is displayed on the lower right around the map.. instead of attack tab, skill tab should be separated each specialty :)",
        "This is the best RPG game for mobile! It worth downloading it. They only have minor bugs but take a long time to load the data when you start playing it for the first time. Still, I LOVE THIS GAME",
        "Its ok but for anyone thats new to a rpg game will get lost because some important tutorials aren't included in the beginning that should be. Like stat distribution and how to enhance your skills. Fixing that will make the game a bit more user-friendly.",
        "This game worked fine on my galaxy s8 prior to the last update. Now all i get is errors about memory not responding and the game closes. Game was enjoyable. Until the issue is resolved, this review is mostly negative.",
        "After last update my attack power is half it use to be. Why?? That sucks. I need a lot attack just to kill low level monster"

Edit: it won't allow me to invite friends, I'm able to play one game a day unless I continuously buy more tokens...but with ads after every game, they get funding from them. I installed this game because the reviews were the best, but maybe it's just got a grudge against me!",
        "I understand they are trying to make money off this app, but if you are going to charge someone 320 tickets to play 4 cards, the reward should be more than 70 tickets per win.  I mean, really?! Some people want to play bingo, but want something to work toward without being bored.  I played Bingo story and deleted it, because I had a lot of credits, but EVERY BOARD WAS THE SAME.  Also, the powerups in this game should be limited to what you have available, and not have to purchase because you are out of said power up.  It might make more people play if they are rewarded.  .  I mean the quests saying you will win 600 tickets if you complete the quest, but you're spending on the normal side 280+ tickets, really?  And no other options besides watching ad videos for free credits?  And I'm not saying to add a \"download this app and run it for 3 tickets.  Reach level 300 for 40 tickets.\"  Rant over",
        "Everything would be pretty neat, but there should be another way to get more tickets. I've been stuck at the New York state for several days now, cause I can only replay the first stages with the tickets from the daily bonus.",
        "Love it. The only reason I didn't give 5's across the board is it gets costly per game as you gain levels. The games are way fun and you can play up to 8 cards !!!!!",
        "There should be more ways to get or win more tickets and power-ups. I also think the costs per cards increases too much from board to board. Other than those two issues, I love this game. Would play more if there were other ways to get/win tickets, the purchase costs is ridiculous for the middle/working-class.  I'd rather pay my bills than buy fake in-game tickets that CAN'T win me REAL CASH. Thank you keep up the good work.",
        "It's a fun game. You have to be quick near the end beacause the game seem to end while the caller is still calling the last number. You don't get a penalty for daubing the wrong number."

At level 46 I unlocked the whistles, at level 90 I finished the first puzzle, at level 95, I got my first carousel, at level 100 I had unlocked everything except the puppies...still need red puppy, at level 101 I got my first ferris wheel, at level 105 I got the first swinging ride, at level 121 I unlocked tier 7 & at lvl 130 I finished 2nd puzzle. Only thing I hate is the adds popping up as I touch the board, so it goes to the game & I have to exit. Edit: third time playing. March 2018. So much has changed!!! Quests, boxes, keys & now my game is saved...had to start from scratch but wont lose it again!!!",
        "I've run 2 other apps to get bonus coins both at almost 1k each and I never got my coins. I finished the tutorial like it said I had to but zero coins were given for it. U shouldn't offer free coins to run other apps if u aren't going to give the coins for it. Will probably give up and delete bc of it.  Tried to give it a 2nd chance and did the flash light purchase to get 2268 coins and never got my coins. Why offer free coins if u won't give the free coins?  I emailed like recommend and sent proof like requested and still nothing. I smell a lawsuit for false advertisement. My $4.99 spend on a flashlight is going to make me thousands. Thanks for not doing ur job.",
        "Extreme amount of ad pop ups. Usually loses dollars and coins. Fun but with all the flaws its not worth it. I played so far and it started over out of nowhere. Can't load or anything. Waste of my time",
        "It's is nearly impossible to play because of the amount of pop-ups. In one minute, I counted 15 pop-ups. Even if you aren't touching the screen, whilst waiting on coins, it jumps from advertisement to advertisement. A decent game ruined by pop-ups.",
        "It has its moments. With the abundance of ads present and the fact that the game gives notifications for things you cant get and the forced instructions at times it is a okay game but pretty boring after a while.",
        "I really enjoy this game..I  originally began playing to earn credits for another game but drifted past level 7,which was the required level I intended to complete and stop playing. Next thing I knew I was clicking away, determined to get the next cute \"prize,\" down the centre aisle. I looked up to see I was at level 10! Geez! I knew I was hooked when I found myself looking at my coin balance..found it satisfactory...smiling...i forgot my original game...now that's an addictive game!! Lol! I blame the cute puppy dog prize that lured me with its overwhelming cuteness.."

        "This is a fascinating game where you're a concubine battling it out with the thousands upon thousands of other concubines (players) vying for the emperor's affection. The YouTube ads are a bit misleading, and don't represent actual gameplay. Most of the game involves you getting an army of souls of historical  figures so you can fight other people's armies to continue the story  or get crucial items that will help level up your army. There's the option to slap/curse people, but most of the existing players apparently take this game WAY too seriously, and you can cause party wars and get disowned by your own party just by 宮鬥 ing easily offended people, which is pretty dumb since this game actively encourages you to do it. I've been told and reprimanded (?!?!?) to \"play nice so everyone can have a good time,\" which defeats the purpose and entertainment of this game...? There's definitely many layers to this game, and a complete time-suck (usually takes me about 2-3 hours of daily gameplay to finish all the missions to get the daily rewards). Very entertaining (and would be more entertaining if most of the players had thicker skin and don't flip out and try to get you destroyed in the game just because their avatar looks bruised for like an hour after a slapping).",

        "Perty good Edit: We're in the middle of an event and the game won't load. Finally says down for maintenance. It would be nice to get a heads up on when that happens. Gonna put a hindrance on the event that's over on Friday. Do hope it's resolved soon. Still like the game tho, but would like it better if I can play.",
        "Well a very basic game, as any other idle game. Has no real extra things that would wow you. Notifications less than a minute after closing the app (or simply pressing home) can get very annoying. As if I need a notification to tell me I closed the game.",
        "Right.  First off, If you are not a fan of Idle games, then don't play. This is the epitome of an Idle game.   The Early game is pretty simple. Click, Collect, Make your way to Level 80. You have the option to buy gold, but I wouldn't bother.   Multiplyers come from a variety of Sources, and regular events give permanent boosts to the Main game.   Good to pick up and play for 10 minutes at different points of the day, Deep enough to just about keep my intrest beyond this.   Issues. Events: They keep adding new things to Events and not really following up on them. Betting hasn't been used in a while, Costumes are confusing, and the card collection in a previous event was a fairly obvious cash grab, requiring that upgrade the cards you have using gold.  Event's are often straight copy pastes of previous events, and will sometimes continue to reference previous events'  All in, pretty good.",
        "Well guess they deleted my last post cause I complained that the game took up 1.8 gig till I uninstalled it and reinstalled it then lost my saves because of bad programming.   Don't waste your time or money on this company.",
        "One of the best \"tap\" games. Love the satirical theme. Who would have thought that politics and money were SO interconnected😁. Just to be clear to some, I AM being sarcastic!!!! Great time waster. And that's NOT fake news.",
        "They put so many buttons to purchase things ion the main screen. When tapping as is the nature of the game, it brings up confirmation for your purchases. If you're trying to play fast, you could easily spend $20 in mere seconds without noticing. Put all the purchases in one place instead of cheating players."

My only suggestion is maybe if someone takes the time to watch an ad for a lavastone maybe give them 2 or something those ads are long lol",
        "I do really like this game. But I have to admit I do not think it is as good as the other virtual villager games. Looks fantastic but it's missing the schools and other things. I miss being able to get a master doctor. I also think compared to the other games. The tech points are harder to get and it's not as fun or exciting upgrading in this game as it was with the other games.. I still enjoy it but I just feel like it's missing something.",
        "I love this series. One thing I would like to say is things should happen at a set time or after you finish something. I still have 4 puzzles that I am no closer to finishing then I was a week ago. But these games are fun and are a great way to pass the time. I actually play it on my laptop so it's a little easier for me.",
        "I love the game so much! I have played every other virtual villagers game and I love all of them; they are the best games ever. It's really challenging to get items that you need so you can complete a puzzle. It took me forever to finish chapter 1, but I finally finished 3 months ago, so now I'm waiting for chapter 2. It's really fun. Although it took forever to get the box to decorate the tree and to get the crab, but they were not as difficult as trying to get the pan to pan the gold because I couldn't see where it's location was and I looked everywhere, but I ended up finding it. Then there was the problem with trying to get the gold, becase the pan disappeared after getting the first gold. It was difficult to find the location to get the other two gold nuggets because I couldn't tap the area to find it, I could only find it by dropping a villager on it ( again I don't know where the location is) to get the gold. But I ended up finding them and in a way it was actually pretty fun for me to try and get the gold because it was challenging, but it did take forever. All'in'all it's a really good game; I just suggest (for the sake of other players) to make it possible to find the pan and the location to get the gold. I still love the game and I can't wait for chapter 2, and I hope for more in the future, you guys are the best so keep up the good work.  Thanks for the great game.",
        "Game has no instructions, no way of knowing what needs to be crafted etc,  huts can only be built when technology is learnt, and then no huts are used? Etc love shack and crafting... there are certain things you CANT pick up despite being told you can... no way of lighting the fire, no way of mixing herbs without water, but you have water in the craft hut?   No way of catching butterflies... i relised a giant octopus that sits and dose nothing..lolol crazy game massive improvements needed hence the 3 stars...",
        "I really  like  this game and all the villager games, also virtual families  2. I'm  disappointed  that  I  had to start over because of an upgrade issue that was not fixed. I lost all my progress. Luckily  I didn't  lose the heron and lemur that I paid for. Customer services  could use improvement ."

And I absolutely love my lil pets and their powers 😊 and the ingame friends I have are helpful. edited: I completed a purchase and did not recieve anything like the quest said I would. Also developers never responded to my email regarding something else. I've spent $40 bucks on this game in the 1st few days I've been playing and I think I'll keep my lil money to myself now since they haven't fixed the issue.",
        "Would give 5 stars but after you get to a certain level you have to spend real money to get farther. I have spend 65 dollars on this game so far and have been scammed so many times. Its a super fun game but so hard to get anywhere. You should be able to stock up shields. Also its stupid that you have to pay to talk. I might get the VIP if some things changed.",
        "The problem I have is you haven't given the radio toy for the bear and also you can't unfreeze the guy because you don't give out the items to do it even after defeating the monster. You still can't get enough fire logs plus still no radio toy for the bear? Plus should give more coins it is a lot in higher levels",

        "Fun, easy to play, complex to reach higher levels, this game has, so far, been great. No microtransactions (thus far) to continue playing, which is a huge plus. A few have stated a couple of bugs, which I agree with, adding only one other comment; I do wish their was an offline option for at least some gameplay. Online still necessary for a lot, but offline to run some dungeons. This could, in theory, help with some server space, as well.",
        "This game is one of the best game I ever played in mobile. I love the graphic which is cute and there is so many content, so it's not boring. And another positive side, you can get the special currency easily in the game. It's not a p2w games ^^ but the sign board was one of the best micro transaction I've ever seen. Try it and you'll see.. it's a lot of fun ^^",
        "I've been looking for a game like this for ages! I was a fan of Runestone Keeper and wanted something similar for my phone. These guys knocked it out of the park. I rarely spend money on phone games, but these guys deserve every penny and accolade coming their way. Fun and  simple, yet brilliant in execution and design. Tons of content already, and I can't wait to see what's next. Keep up the great work!",
        "This game is so much fun! My only complaint is that the gear is gone when done with the maze, so you start it over. As well as \"learning new titles\". It gets kinda old having to start that over every time you beat a full maze. But that aside, this game is definitely addictive! Keep up the great work!",
        "Your game is amazing. You guys are amazing. After everything you went through, you deserve these stars at the very least. Your game isn't pay to win, it's just a grand experience and I love it.  One of the BEST games on the market easily.  Keep up the good work, you're all doing fantastic.  Respect",
        "I've been playing like nine months and it's very addictive you really grow and have many choices. It's truly free to play and gems are everywhere. Buying a signboard for real money is the best bang for your buck and a lizard if you feel like buying something else.  Totally recommend it. I only hate getting creator gumball is so expensive other than that it's a great game. It's a game that goes as fast or as slow as you feel like playing."

You don't have bells and whistles going off in your ear at the whole time and that's a nice change. I love playing slots and I think this is one of the best.",

        "250 spins today at 100k each. Got one feature which paid 1m. Today was a good day its usually a higher ratio. There is absolutely no satisfaction in this app. No longevity. It just swallows the coins. No satisfaction whatsoever. PLEASE TRY SOMETHING ELSE further to the above I played 161 further spins and still no bonus or feature.

        "Great idle game that you can play as much or as little as you want, even if you only have a few minutes. My only gripe is all the inactive guilds. Finding a guild with an active guild master is virtually impossible, and when the gm quits all guild upgrading is over. It's also frustrating that all the upgrades you earn for a guild stay with the guild so if your guild master comes back after 6 months and kicks you, you get to start from scratch with no bonuses.",

The one above the have supplied to Google bounced back.  The one they advertise in game gets ignored. Take your money oh yes they sure WILL given the daily but this offers. NO SUPPORT REPORTING TO GOOGLE as support email is fake.",
        "This game is wildly disproportionate.... There are players who spend thousands of dollars on in-app purchases and have insane amounts of power so they pick on the players who can't afford to do the same. The amount of resources required to upgrade technology and buildings becomes astronomical very quickly and mining for the resources needed is impossible due to the fact that the huge players hunt mines. Adding to this, every time your fleet gets hit on a mine or a base you lose 20% of that fleet, which costs you more resources to build it back up, compounding the impossibility to grow unless you spend insane amounts of money. If you don't have ridiculous amounts of money to waste on this game, don't bother downloading it.",

Then when you complain, he purposely delays any response for 48 hours because that takes you outside of the Google Play store Return Policy...thus forcing you to either continue to not be responded to OR contest the entire transaction as fraud through your bank.

        "It's enjoyable enough but the prices are an absolute joke. I usually spend quite a bit of money on apps, so I was all set to buy the premium package, expecting it to be between 2 and 4 quid a month. This is absolutely ridiculous - almost £10 a month, as if the game isn't already dripping with ads. It's greedy.",
        "The cost for extra packs is unbelievably expensive! I would not pay more than 10.00 TOTAL. Also every day you should get 3 hints and 2 hints for solving each game",
        "One of the best free apps out there. Almost every puzzle seems overwhelming, but if you skip the ones you don't know, and solve the ones you do know, it starts filling in the blanks and most of the time you can solve the whole puzzle with no hints. Fun game!",
        "Good game but over $20 per month is WAY beyond my budget. Too bad as I was hooked until I saw the price. Please contact me if you ever lower the cost to a reasonable amount. :(",
        "This is one of the most   addictive games I've ever played!! Keeps me up for hours, even when I have an extremely hard time keeping my eyes open!  I could play 24/7, it's that much fun!!",
        "Love this game! Would give it 5 stars if the paid piece wasn't subscription based and so expensive. 20 bucks per month is ridiculous, wish it was more affordable so I could support the developers. Once I finish the free section I will have to uninstall."

        "I reckon this game is so good! I reckon it needs a test mode track so when you finish fixing the car fully to 100% you can test it. And probably alot more cars to fix, and also instead of having just one place where there are garages. You can go all over the world to different type of country's where there are different cars like Australia has commodores, Japan of skyline etc. Love this game so much ❤ hope you take this into exception",
        "Overall the game is exactly what you think it would be, a mobile version of car mechanic simulator 2018. That being said the rotate and zoom features of the camera can be a little irritating at times. It's also very hard to make money to get to your 4th level of tools when you can't completely repair the majority of cars that you get. It can be a little frustrating to purchase a car only to realize that you cannot completely restore it.",
        "Great game and efforts of game generating team are appreciated. I wld suggest to add few things like  tires wheel rims tinted glass at extra cost and if used will pay more while selling. Also sometimes when we buy car from barn in some cases few parts could be made missing so that player wld need to search and then purchase new to add more fun. After u get all tools and all cards then it is boaring....",
        "Trying to find a support link?? I have all tools yet wont give me a bonus.... Love the game. Camera can be a pain sometimes but you learn where to and where not to touch parts.

        "The game is good (played like 5 missions so far) but i feel like there should be a jump and crouch feature, even if its just a jump feature. Maybe make some levels where you gotta utilize the jumping, maybe throw in some jet packs during some missions/raids to get to a certain area to either continue the mission and/or find some hidden crates. Also, maybe add some melee weapons too?  Besides that, the game is fun, the graphics are beautiful, the gameplay could improve tho.",
        "Its awesome. Running smooth with maxed graphics on s8+ and I had no problems while playing it for 10+ hours.  May be starting area could be expanded along with more multiplayer features and interactions. More unique missions between lvl 11 and 15. Also smaller package (5$) could be added. P.S crashes when collecting contract rewards ...Puzzles sucks. Avoid multiplayer and arena untill is fixed",
        "This game has little bit inspiration from many big games like destiny (duh), titanfall, doom. The game does have similarities to dead trigger. All the random loot is cosmetic, guns are easily obtained through missions. Good performance on my S7, but need internet 24×7 to run, even during campaign.",
        "The graphic is awesome.But the game sometimes crashes when entering the casino full of people. Also, add chat system in co-op modes. It's hard to make people understand the puzzles without a chat. Add jump,crouch. It will make the game more attractive and the things are also needed for a game like this. I love the game. Keep adding new things, just don't turn the game into mostly pay to play game.Thanks.",
        "Literally the best mobile game I have ever played. All IAP so far is cosmetic, which is great. Very similar to destiny with it's own flavor. I do wish you we're able to jump though and shotguns in pvp are OP. Game is optimized well for my mid-grade device. However, it won't run on my gf's ZTE Grand X Max which is very unfortunate considering it's basically the same phone as mine. Hopefully this changes soon because we really looked forward to playing together. Download this game!!!",
        "Giving the review after 24hrs of gameplay. Have to say that it's awesome. Cudos to the creators. Loving the gaming experience. Graphics rendering should be calibrated more. Make sure to do that in next update. Coins and slots are hard to obtain. Many of them don't want  to spend real money so better give some daily tasks to complete and earn coins."

I have two issues! it's seems the only way to get hero fragments is through the shops which is only 10 at a time. or special attack missions which keep changing! makes it very hard to awaken shinobi.  also why only 8 chapters in story mode! You have a whole two anime to base off and we only get 8 chapters! how disappointing.",
        "I am a little disappointed in the game right now. I saved up for the Jiriya banner which is supposed to have a higher drop rate, got one Jiriya card in a multi 10xs summon. I would like to know why that happened seeing as with every other banner I have ever pulled on had numerous cards for that shinobi, sometimes even the full kit minus an ult. I am not looking for an ultimate every time. But when I pull on a banner I would like the rate to actually be reasonable thank you very much.",

All of a sudden, everytime I try to play any kind of mission on my android, a message will pop up saying, 'Due to an unknown error the game will return to the title screen'.

        "4 days ago i was having a problem of playing missions. I couldnt start it because the screen showed \"due to an unknown error the game is returning to the title screen\". The issue was resolved yesterday and again today the same old stuff. Is this a joke going on with my account?",
        "To BANDAI NAMCO... Just suggesting a few thought about this game. I've taken liken this game more than any other I played so far.  I just thought during the mission about the choosen characters. I think this game will be more stratigical if you can switch characters during the mission. It just doesn't make any sense if the main character you control died right away. Since in a story there's still a chance to turn the table on your side. Just like in Naruto series though their team captain may die the subordinates will carry their will and a chance to win. And in this game,  If the main character died the rest automatically dies though there's still a lot of spare life. Hope you call consider.  Just making suggestion. Your AWESOME making this game BANDAI NAMCO.",
        "I really like this game, the only reason im giving it a 1 star. Is because I've tried to send them a message involving an issue but I cant seem to find the way to do it. In regards to the issue I hope they see this message and fix it, for some reason it wont let me do any missions. I have updated it and deleted the cache but the problem persist."

        "An absolutely wonderful game. Even better then Hearthstone if you ask me. It's so good that even I, Solaire of Astora who hails from Dark Souls, absolutely praises this game. 100% recommend. This only issue that one could run into is lag, but this is only due to the fact that I have an older phone. I'm sure that if you have a better phone, this game would be EVEN better. Praise the Sun \\[T]/",
        "Elder scrolls legends is a game with a elder scrolls taste and mechanics. Its choices, game modes and progress systems works perfect. It's story is great, and serve as a tutorial for the big part of the game. You can even unlock new dlc and decks through your progress in the game. This is truly a marvelous game. Problems like connection break occurs very rare and does not affect the game. If you like CCG and ELDER SCROLLS, then this game is highly recommended.",
        "Hands down one of the best card games I have ever played. The gameplay is simplistic yet emersive. The different combinations of cards and deck types you can build is vast allowing you to adapt to any challenge you may encounter. While the gameplay is phenomenal, it's very easy to gain an understanding of how to play and the cards themselves. Bethesda has yet again made a game that has captivated me. Well done 👍",
        "The first three turns of the game has an incredibly small amount of finite moves.  You wouldn't know this because the typical player will take more than 30 seconds on their first, second, and third turns.  You start to realize that on \"draft\" games, you will benefit more if you concede the game when your opponent is taking an agonisingly long time on the first few turns because they're putting so much thought into the only play in their hand.",
        "Week 1: *Going to try to make this an ongoing review*. Had to lower this to 4 stars overall, because you have to either pay or grind to access all of story mode. I'm gonna buy it, but I think it shouldn't cost more than $14.99. Just mho. PvP is fun and you actually play LIVE people, not an AI running someone's cards. Level rewards seem generous and worthwhile.  Runs a bit slow, but I know it's my phone and not the app's fault. Gameplay is very fluid and makes sense. I already like it FAR BETTER than Hearthstone.",
        "Fun game! Is very generous with card packs and rewards. Plenty of deck complexity yet easy to get into. The RnG can be troublesome at times, but I guess that's just how card games go. Would definitely recommend if you enjoy card games, specially if you're and Elder Scrolls fan."

I was able to get everything in the game without spending money up until now. Now I have spend money in order to get the more interesting content. Sadly, this app will be deleted. I am not giving Nintendo even more of my money, it is not a real Animal Crossing game to waste money on.",
        "I love playing this game, but now I can't get into the game, all I get is support error 802-9016. Don't try and tell me to move closer to the WiFi source, because I put my phone on the WiFi router and got the same thing. My wife, who is sitting next to me, gets into the game just fine. I uninstalled that game, same thing... I would love to get back into this game, and will change my first reassuring back to a 5, but until then... Yeah... Please help....",
        "First-time reviewer and life-long Animal Crossing player. This game combines everything good about the game series like fishing, but catching, gardening, decorating, and more. Therea is always an event going on to keep me playing multiple times a day. The team behind this game actually listen to what people say and fix it and add ease of play features! People saying this is pay to play are full of it. I have well over 600 leaf tickets from just playing the game... you just have to put in the time and complete challenges.",
        "I love the happy music and the relaxed vibe I get while playing this game. Easy enough for young children to learn to play, but not so infantile that an adult can't enjoy it instead. The garbled chipmunk-speak language of the animal friends is hilarious! Level progression seems fair and regular. Pay-to-play options are not necessary to have a good game experience.",
        "I would give this 5/5 across the board, as I have been playing since the November release and enjoyed every moment. Every update has made the game better, as the team listens and integrates whatever they can to make it better.  Microtransactions are ignorable, and they give leaf tickets hand over fist, besides the customizables for the campsite (foreground, midground, background) which are expensive.  Hopefully future updates brings better options.",
        "Just like the actual Animal Crossing games, but with even MORE to do! The only difference is you're a camp owner instead of a town mayor. Oh, and the fact that's it's a FREE app!   Seriously, this is a real deal AC game all squeezed into a free app. It's perfection all around if you like games like AC. They did such an amazing job on it."

        "Cool, nice improvement from MCoC. I love how the dev put Generation version of Transformers to the game specially Combiner wars and Titans Return (my recent favorite TF toylines). i hope the dev put references in the generation bots name since the movie and beast war character has reference on it.  But 1 thing is why my achievements doesn't work ??",
        "Beautiful graphics, love the collection of characters. One of the greats, definitely a must. Love the aesthetics of the maps and battles. My only complaint is my bot entering the fight already transformed unlike the cpu. I think both should enter in alt form THEN transform, if only to hear the sound lol.",
        "Much better than I thought it would be. It's an unconventional fighter to be sure but it's fun. The models in the game are amazing and somewhat bum me out they aren't being used for a more traditional 2d fighter on a thing that uses controllers. They were even able to make the Bayformers look good!  The many currencies and general in-game transactions are probably turning me off of what is otherwise a neat game. Kinda wish I could just buy it, have everything unlocked, and not have any of that garbage influence the design at all.  Besides that the team did a great job with what I imagine Hasbro told them to do.",
        "Great game good graphics nice controllers needs more characters and more unique attacks, had to edit from a 4* to a 2* star because the game is a fighting with no live action PvP mode. It's strictly a player vs ai game and that is unattractive to players who enjoy the competitive edge of a PvP fighting game. Will uninstall it gets very boring and repetitive , with out the PvP mode. Will reinstall when or if PvP ever becomes available. Me and a larger group of fighting game players will be waiting to invest in this game once PvP becomes available.",
        "I think it is an amazing game. I have a few requests: Have the dupe rate of daily crystals lowered Add more ways to get Energon  Add at least one of these:  Rumble Frenzy   G1 Onslaught  G1  Hot Rod   Prime Soundwave   Any G1 Stunticons  Cyclonus #Gameoftheyear",
        "The game is good but worst thing about this game is that it always needs cellular data for every fight. I have 4G network then also it keep Loading in a very slow speed. I request to the game management to give feedback on this problem."

You know what we are waiting for. Yes! MAKE this world at last, please, and people who love RO will give you 5 stars! I know that soon there will be Ragnarok Mobile developed by a Chinese studio. They try to live up to the merits of the original game. I think their game will blow many fans of your game.

Personal opinion gems are way overpriced. Once again though fantastic artwork. Thanks mynet keep updating",

The graphics are pixelated, it burns so much battery when the most animation that comes out of it is something you'd get out of a powerpoint slideshow. It's extremely glitchy and the loading is so slow. I'm so sad they re-released this to suck money out of people yet couldn't put in any effort to make the game updated and modern.",

        "Time to Uninstall, new server open every week and nothing new about the game. Lag and disconnect every 3-5 min. It's got worst after S17 open.. this game is the same as Loong Craft just different skin. But at least loong craft server is much more sturdy. Please DON'T tell me to check connection or reinstall the game, because I already did it 3 times, connection it's perfectly fine, cuz all my other game I play run just fine.",
        "The game was amazing. Have a good quality in terms of graphics and smooth controls. However, I encountered problem in my account. After I reach LEVEL 35 my character was totally gone and advices me to create a new one. Please help me regarding with my problem. Any reply are very much appreciated. I will change my ratings after I recovered my character. Thank you.",
        "I really love this game. But my only problem here is the  issues of so many servers thats why other players wants to go to other servers to start playing again. Instead of focusing to the last server they had. When saying that the server is FULL it doesnt mean that all character here is active, when the new server is open everyone choose to  go there. What will happen to the other nation on the old server??? Some are ghost nation, coz everybody quits becoz of new server. Please fix this issues. Thank you.  Please bring back my 6000 power loss on my character on s25"

The only benefit for connecting with my Facebook account used to share to get free coins but that's minimal compared to the one she get normally and login as a guest.   And....  After all the trouble and being shorted more millions than I can count...  I guess I'm silly to think, in good faith, they would load some points for you, just to say thanks for being a player and it's their way of apologizing. After all other apps like World Series of Poker did that without hesitation.  Perhaps I'm getting frustrated to the point that I'm considering to  take my money elsewhere and unistall it.",

        "I hate to say it but what I thought at first was a cool extra is now ruining the game. It's no longer competitive on skill, it's just about how much you are willing to pay to get upgrades which negates any skill involved. It's just a money grab. If you don't pay and upgrade you lose!  Simple as that. So if you want a game with skill this is no longer it. If you want a game to empty your wallet to feed your ego then this is the game for you!",
        "Super glitchy!!! Love this game but I'm getting crazy annoyed!! Lost my lucky spins used one and it took 4 off me!!! The game has done this multiple times!! It needs to bed fixed, remove all the bloody adds.",
        "Could you guys maybe cool it with the damn ads? I can't even navigate the menus now without a 60% chance of getting a 15 second video about some crappy game with \"war\", \"clash\" or \"clans\" in the title...  Other than that, the gameplay itself is ok. Aside from maybe the lowered necessity for Tetrises because of power-ups or the annoying-ass \"some pieces are affected by gravity, but we won't point it which ones until you cause them to drop by attempting to set up your next move\" mechanic.  Seriously though, those ads after EVERY GAME NOW are cancer on toast. Knock it off.",
        "To many cheaters on the tournaments and no way to report them. Doesn't even make sense why they would cheat, it's obvious when you can watch the games. Spoils it so much for others",
        "Been playing this game for long time and am on level 191. It seems ur always gona hav and giv problems ! WHY won't it go to level 192 even tho I've cleared 191",
        "This gameplay makes Tetris way too easy. There is a swipe option for traditional feels but no one will win any tournaments or achievements with that."

        "Love the gameplay and the graphic but the reason why I'm not giving a 5 star because every time I open a \"guarantee 4star\" hero scroll, I kept getting 3 stars hero only. It didn't happen just once, twice or thrice, but it happen too many times.  I'm pretty sure this is a bug because the scroll didn't guarantee 4 star heroes.  Update: Much better",
        "At the beginning it's very intriguing. Soon it becomes tedious because it requires purchasing equipments otherwise you just can't pass. (I have 2 6star and 1 5star GuanYu all lv max, legendary equipment, still not able to pass an normal 7-3)And it's so time consuming to level your hero up 20 times an episode to level up by one, and even if you max up 3 6-star heroes, you can barely pass episode 7... the graphics and the acts are very good, though.",
        "Since the last update the game is running really slow. The hits don't register, it starts adjusting the volume settings on my phone for no reason instead of attacking. The chad feature doesn't work. I tried chatting on dozens of channels and there's no one there. No way I would pay for this game.",
        "Campaign is short but fun. PVP sucks big time. Matchmaking needs a big overhaul. It's not fun getting one hit by opponents who have super high level characters. Also the whole you have to fully beat you opponent before the timer find out or you lose is another deal breaker. Lower the HP on all charcters, fix the matchmaking, or make the timer longer because it is almost impossible to down all three characters in allotted time as a new player. I mean my characters aren't the best but definitely not the worst",
        "The graphics and gameplay is superbed,but really p2w unless ur a casual player . Grinding is tedious and u only get good stuff once a while,RNG is pretty bad but i so far have gotten 1 gold 6* character.There are also other game modes which really isnt rewarding like the boss fight that gives 100 silver LoL.Even coalition needs 200k power. not even my officer can come near 70k power. I hope the game be more generous towards f2p player,since transcendence is already almost unobtainable unless u pay to get 6* officers. i gave an extra * for the reply. i hope to see improvements in the future. This game has potential.",
        "Great. But can another (two) characters become AI? Can you add new characters in the upcoming dynasty warriors 9? And also add the collaboration of samurai warriors, orochi warriors, and others. And hold an event too. I'm bored, no events or updates.  And can you make \"skip\" for conquest. Can you add time from friend help? Time 15 seconds is too little, not including his friend attacked and bounced. I suggest it can be 30 seconds and the friend takes out the ultimate one last time.   Update : I'm bored.."

Keep playing the same level over and over until you can upgrade, play another level, then proceed to keep playing the same level again. The competitive mode is also messed up as the opponent gets scores near impossible",
        "Everything is great and good but only have one problem. And this problem will killing you all. That's the loading is damn slow no matter you are in LTE network or wifi situation. Because of slow loading it will kill your battery life fast as well. Please help to fix the problem and I will re-rate again. Thanks",
        "Even with a perfect LTE speed game struggled with downloading hunts. The game forces you to do certain hunts before you can go back to the ones you like and want to finish. Not too mention every other minute it forces you to watch an ad or tries to get you to buy something from them. I will be deleting this app once i finish posting this comment.",

        "The game currently wont open, when it does its constantly crashing and force stopping. I have the silver subscription ($1.00/weekly) and im unable to take advantage of the content im paying for  want a refund. The upgrades and new equipment are too expensive, the gear and parts are also too expensive and hard to come by especially for the spearfishing which is the best part of the game.. You certainly can't get very far without spending some real money. You can be killed by animals when the come from behind so you with your limited turning capability you have no chance to defend yourself. A lot of problems.",
        "During cts theres moments get sudden lag and it throws off the shooting causing to miss when i know aiming right. It never had these lag bits before."

        "Its pretty great overall but I dont like the fact that I cant expend anymore after level 60. Id love more space since you need to put lots of decorations for challenges . I also think there should be hearts every good bubble not just one out of 3ish. When you need 100 hearts its a long time getting them. Besides that very great game, still play it!",
        "Sadly I have decided today to uninstall this game. I've been really enjoying it but it is simply too resource hogging for me and keeps crashing. I think it needs an option to turn off animations especially when building etc.  EDIT. Since getting a newer, faster Samsung tablet the game has improved for me immeasurably. Excellent!",
        "Amazing game! Very similar to the original RC Tycoon, but a few added changes to make it more interesting. I've only encountered one major glitch where my park was erased and instead was given a friend's (I still had all coins, tickets, cards) but I had to rebuy whatever rides and buildings I had that my friends park didn't BUT they reimbursed me for it and gave me enough coins to rebuild my park (probably twice over thh). So overall a great game and great customer assistance too!",
        "Usually ill make it to level 10 in other games like, but this has been the only one that can hold my attention for so long. Just hit level 40 a figured it deserved a review! 5 stars from me! I love that you dont have to wait for anything. The missions just keep popping up regardless of how many you finish. If I didn't have any responsibilities I could literally play all day long.",
        "Awesome game! Great time- killer... Pls change so that decor and trophy bonuses apply to food and shop stores. They generate revenue just like rides do so makes no sense for them not to receive the decor bonus.  Pls change and will give 5 stars."

It is silly to invest an hour into exploring only to lose it all because of an extra click, especially when you have a bunch of telaports. When player runs out of food, options should be camp, teleport, or suicide...and suicide should NOT be clicking anywhere on the screen. Provide a button.",

You can pick the best choices and do the right attacks at the right times but still lose over half the time.  Where is the fun in that? I've defeated the council of ricks and collected most of the mortys but my odds of winning a tournament are the exact same as a level 1 player.",

Fueled by the love of Rick and Morty + Pokemon. This game speaks spritually to me.",

WELL, if you are reading this, you are either the creators or someone who wants a friend request. Send a friend request to lickmyballs24681. Get the joke in there?",

        "Screenshots made this game look amazing. But then i loaded this up, and didn't even want to finish the tutorial, (which felt never-ending) because I realized this an exact copy of Hobbits Kingdoms, which I stopped because there was never any actual battles, or  motion graphics. And all of those cool CGi characters don't play as shown in the screenshots. Deleted.",
        "In short this is the perfect pocket game. Strategy meets battles and bloodshed. You can play the game how you like, its not like clash of clans where your forced to be hostile, and it gives you a good start. Honestly, i dont understand why people dont like this game however all the bad reports seemed to be from players of the old game....",
        "Love the game. I've been playing since the realeasd of the game before it became Elves Vs Dwarves. They have done an amazing job with this game. Some things could have been better like a majority of my inventory resetting when i rejoined after the game was bought. But overall a wonderful game either way.",
        "Terrible game. In the original hobbit I was an original world 42, back in dec 2012.  Fully maxed 5 cities 100 billion might every hero in every city was min 250 some were 280. Not to mention had couple hundred mithril left in my account Plus 10s of thousands of troops to unbox.. when i went to update game the merged 6 new worlds and im back to level 1.. lmao stupid move on your end. Loyal player here now gone! Was an awesome game i loved it super fun now... seems to be a joke. Duces",
        "It's ok.. I wish they wouldn't have changed the Hobbit into this. It was a good game but I can't get into it now that they changed everything, I guess they \"stole\" or used the Lord of the rings without permission, probably copyright issues so they changed everything.. Now it's pretty lame..",
        "In server 179 one player might still 640m his troops still not cleared he still no 1 in might rank as he is a small player name . latrobio  of NOTORIOUS alliance please fix this. All others T5 troops cleared.he have lots of illigal troops of T5"
