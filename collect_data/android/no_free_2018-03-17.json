        "I see a lot of people complaining about the new version. Yes, I mastered the insane level on the old version and was struggling with the new version when it first came out. Just give it some time/practice and change your strategies around. You'll end up mastering the insane level on the new version too, just like I did.",
        "Used to be my favorite game.  The latest update completely changed the character of the game.  The ball is faster, bouncier, and everything is smaller, and it all adds to just randomness.  The AI got worse at the same time, so it's not really harder... just more random.  I now find that this game stresses me out instead of helping me relax, so I have to give it up.",
        "First version was my favourite thing to play but the update looks like a different game entirely. The ball got too small and the physics became stupid and random",
        "This game is really bored! I'm so stress! I lose and second you lose again why Glow Hockey is bored a bored game! But like it. I'm nervous to play because you lose... but I'm happy..",
        "Used to be a five star game. Latest release has wrecked it. HATE the new adverts between every game, has totally ruined a great game, uninstalled.",
        "Better if you introduce online mode like in 8 ball pool.And disable multiple touches so that if anyone else touch the screen the paddles don't go in his control.THANKS,REST GAME IS GOOOD."

        "Such a Blast to Play. App never seems to grow boring like some other games. Also the apps not constantly hounding you to spend on Upgrades and Advances which is nice. Your character jumps higher, flips and twirls faster as U advance further. I play it once or twice a day at least. All in All a great/fun app....ENJOY !!",
        "The game is very fun and progression is steady as you get better, on the downside once you get through your first play through with the app and come back later there are 30 second adds that pop up after every other round or so. A little disappointing but no biggie the game is really quite fun.",
        "I feel like I would really like this game but it is not working on the Android phone. So I have never actually played the game but I have tried to open it up like 50 times.  Every time I tried to open it, it would just lag out right when it was going to show me the home screen.  If this gets fixed then I will play this game and most likely enjoy the game but for now it is awful.",
        "In this game once you have all of the flips it gets really boring. Also there are way to many ad breaks. This game was really fun but now that it's newer it's boring. It lags to much and kicks me out. I give this 1 star",
        "Ads ads and more ads. And really pushy ads that you can't just close straight away too. You spend more time watching ads than playing the game, and honestly you can't advance in the game without watching ads for coins anyway, so it's basically an advertisement with a mini game in between. Scummy sell out app.",
        "This game is great but I would only rate it a five if there were less adds. Every game I play, as soon as I finished it said \"add break\". This is very annoying as the adds are up to 30 seconds long. Please get rid of them."

        "This game was absolutely perfect and was very much enjoyable, but now to unlock the full experience you have to pay. One of the reasons I enjoy this game and recommended it to my friends is because it is one of the only games that isn't locked behind a paywall. Overall, I have had countless hours playing this game, and trying to land on everything and return successfully. Instead of the microtransaction, why not institute a merit-based system for unlocking parts?",
        "Very great!  Here are a few suggestion from me to make your game more enjoyable :)  1. Can you please make the earth scale correctly because its diameter is around 12.000 km and moon orbit is around 380.000 km  2. Please make a smaller powerful engine like the 9 engines of the falcon 9  3. Please make a button that is simple to cycle from another rocket to another one to ease the attempt of landing a booster  4. Please add an ocean on the earth for some splashdown  5. The last one. Im a free 2 play player and i cant enjoy a majority of the new update :*(",
        "This game is awsome. Loads of fun. Told my friends about it. Could you add a free sandbox mode and more free parts. Thanks. Keep up the good work. Shouldn't have added micro transactions. It just ruined the game for me. Had to take it from a 5 star to a 3 star. Please bear this comment in mind for future updates. This game was 100% free when i downloaded it in december last year. Since then, you added a new build system, free parts which make the game absolutely amazing, and then you add pay for parts. Thats just buzzkill.",
        "Very fast and simple rocket building and great graphics. I wish there was a sandbox mode with infinite fuel. Also there is no indication for loading screens when you hit the launch button. Somethimes you think you tapped the button and end up sitting there for a minute or two wasting time.  Edit So glad they made a small payment option. Well worth the money and glad to support",
        "Great!  Only thing I miss is the ability to rendezvous and dock with another object.  In a moon landing, you could leave a stage in lunar orbit and pick it up for the outbound burn.  Also, karman line should be 100 km??  Edit:. Great updates.  I have no idea how to use docking to reattach parts that have been undocked though.",

        "I Personally would like to have the ability to upgrade stars on heroes easier without spending real money. Get 2 to 3 stars on the characters for free leaves me wanting, and im just not spending money on a game like this. Otherwise it is a fun game. Even though it basically can be a full time job you dont make money on and have to spend money on. So if you dont mind commiting months to barely make it to do the late game stuff amd still have to spend months to progress. This game will be great. This review is for those who play ftp games without actually paying to win.",
        "So it's kinda fun but I'm rating it low based on the cost of purchasing character shards versus how many you get. I tested it out and purchased a ton of purple diamond things and purchased character shards that gives between 5 and 330. Out of 7 purchases at 1299 each, I got a total of 41 shards. So for roughly 9100 diamonds, I get 41 shards. You do the math. This game apparently enjoys taking your money. I've mentioned this to the developers with no reply. DC Legends knows what they're doing when it comes to purchases of character shards. At least they make it easier",
        "Very addictive. I started playing casually, and 4 weeks later I find myself checking it all the time. It's best played with at least a minor investment, but reasonably ftp...if you got patience.  Add: it's been six months, and I'm still hammering away at it. It has a huge base of fans,and I've only needed customer support once (and they handled my issue very well and quickly).  Still a bit grind-y, but great little bit of clicky gaming.",
        "This game hooked me up. The community it is very helpfull and growing evryday.Check youtube videos befor you start playing this game because is a griding game and you will need patiance and a good guidance at the start. It is not p2w you can play it as a f2p but you will need patiance so dont worry about money...in this game money will only save you time not exclusive content. 5* from me this is for sure the best mobile game ever. May the force be with you.",
        "The game is fun enough but to sync it with your Google account to have to give your phone and all its abilities to EA. Why is there a need for the game to access my photos and make and answer calls? How 'bout I play a game on my phone with cool light sabers and fun music and when I need to make a call I'll stop for a bit. Just let people play and EA can make bank with their microtransactions. GTFO of people's personal info.",
        "The game is a lot of fun if you are willing to put A LOT of time into grinding things out. They have made huge changes for just quality of life things, but they have kept the core game the same. Grind, grind, grind, grind, and grind some more. You can get everything in the game just by playing it. No need to pay anything. However it would be a lot easier if you could spend 1000$ on the game every couple weeks lol."

FreeFire Battlegrounds is x50 times better and more simply. Go and die in a hole developers.",
        "It has a lot of bugs, but it's a fun game. It has a lot of potential, if you decide to keep on working on it. One major bug that i've noticed is ITEM DOESN'T EXIST. For instance i saw a Scar laying down on the gorund in Military base and when i tried to pick it up it said \"item doesn't exist\". Fix this please, otherwise, a decent game.",
        "Everything is well put together tmain thing I love is that each area is different from on another like at the school ive had alot of vertical fire fights or power plant or the supermarket. But one thing I think u guys forgot is that the ump 45 takes .45 acp rounds",
        "Controls are terrible. When aiming directly at a player between the crosshairs. Bullets still miss. Terrible game if you're reading this go download rules of survival. That's  what I did. Also sometimes during the middle of a game a loading icon will appear. You won't be able to move or shoot your weapon. You'll pretty much die. When in the safe zone you will still take damage even tho you are in the white circle. To many hackers.",
        "I love this game free fire and this game are my favorite mobile games so far but there should be some changes like you should be able to aim with an iron sight. And the aiming could be better and what I mean by that is aiming is already hard on mobile so I just think stability should be really good without any attachments or like the aiming system on free fire battleground. The graphics are not the best I've seen really just up the graphics a bit and add the ability to aim with a iron sight. Other than those things I love how exciting the game is as well as how close it is to pubg.",

Players and teams will be ranked for the match in the order they are eliminated.The safe zone changes randomly in each match, providing players with a fresher, more intense experience each time.Remember, find a weapon and supplies as quickly as you can and then move to the island’s safe zone.This is not just a game, this is battle for survival!!!PLEASE NOTE!

BUT - I payed for levels 13 and 14 , and the game does not allow me to play in random order - it's not possible to play no. 23 without finishing all numbers before. If you are stuck in some number, you cannot go to another one - you MUST BUY hint!!! It means - you PAID for the game, but you MUST PAY again for hint - or you are blocked in PAID  game. It's just not fair.",
        "A lot of Numberlink programs have \"fake\" puzzles - they have multiple solutions unless additional non-standard \"rules\" are followed... which are NEVER fun. This app doesn't do that. These are the real deal, and are VERY satisfying to solve. The price is extremely low for the quantity and quality on offer; I highly recommend this game.",

I've played until 9×9 pack but when I reached a certain level,  the game stopped working after that and I've tried over and over again to go in but the game just keeps bring me back to the home screen and keeps stopping. Please fix it. I really want to play the remaining levels and packs",
        "Great game. Keep coming back to it. I find it relaxing solving the puzzles, though it has become super easy! All versions are great. All in all, awesome job! One of my favourites, and works in any situation. Quick break at work, something productive ? Play. Something to do before sleep? Play. Got a few extra mins? Play! Wanna challenge yourself on timed? Play! Haha.",

The original starts to get boring after awhile, but with all the different variations they come out with, it never gets old. A very fresh experience with one of the recent updates, feels much more refined when compared to the one I used to play.",
        "Simple yet clever, Free Flow is about connecting brightly colored dots together without crossing the lines. With an abundance of board shape, size, variety, and difficulty, there's something in free play to challenge nearly everybody. Those who find even the largest puzzles too easy may alternatively challenge themselves in time trials to finish the boards as quickly as possible."

I thought that the different colours gave you the ability to collect more balls so not really sure what the point of the game is... no way to won or lose ... just click ... I like things with skill... I can handle the ads and would even pay to remove ads if the game have a point.. a purpose a win/lose sort of deal but it's not I don't think I will be keeping this game .. unless they add a little skill to it",
        "This isn't a game. You just hold a button until it disappears and then hold another button... Really. And then there is an option to just have the buttons automatically hold themselves. Then the next level happens and there are new colors, but nothing else is different. Maybe good to keep your baby busy but I wouldn't condone that sort of thing",
        "It's decent. I like the sounds it makes, and the colours look nice too. The forced ads I can't skip after 5 seconds is the annoying part. I get that you need ads, but come on man. I buy 3 upgrades and have to watch a full minute ad. It's like an ad simulator. Honestly if I wanted to play with balls, and watch ads I'd play with my own balls, and throw some ads on YouTube(this part is mostly for humour). Just so you know I'm not salty, annoyed yes, but not salty.",
        "I like the game as it's one when you don't want to think but want to do something. It's very easy. However you watch more ads than you do play the game. So annoying I had to sit through a 1 minute cat chat advert without being able to skip it. Then a 10 second level then another 50 second unskipable ad so annoying",
        "Ads are non skipable which is awful. Skippable ads are ones that pop up that you don't want usually. The full ads like on this game are only usually shown when you are getting a upgrade to a boost or something free etc. Terrible design as you can't win either",
        "I love a stupid game, I really do, not everything has to be top tier strategy or reflex based or whatever  However this is the most boring clicker game ever. At least normal clickers have a theme or SOMETHING to pretend you're doing... Anything at all. Here, you don't even have that. No context, no theme, not even a change of shape or whatever  It's sad gaming has gone this low"

        "Can some please explain to me, why this app needs permission access to my phone?, also why does it take so long to begin I mean is like it's loading a lot of thing for a game extremely simple.",
        "Want to win at this game?  Just aim as much to the side as possible.  The angle you're allowed to shoot at makes the balls bounce back and forth from left to right, killing blocks way too easily.",
        "Bit too easy Basically you can get 3 stars on the first ball on every level Good time waster but not a challenge",
        "A good little game for a boring bus ride or for buying time while waiting around"

Which is fine I just have to wait. But now my issue is that the actual levels for the wedding event, and the normal quest, it kicks me out of the app and it does thatt every time. Please fix this issue. Maybe then Ill give it five stars.",
        "Great addictive game! Starts out cute and innocent. Recently found out through a spoiler thread that it does take a darker turn in Ch 15. The U.S. servers are currently only on Ch 12. Still a great addicting game that many players start out thinking \"Awesome! A great game that I don't I can have the option to play for free!\" Soon they cave when that ONE outfit comes along that they HAVE TO HAVE lol.",
        "I love this game! It's really good for creative people who like to design their own outfits. I just downloaded on my new phone and started over (I don't have Facebook to link my progress with). Please make it available to link with Google play so I don't always lose progress!   Also, since downloading again, I found that some of the names are different... I was very confused, since the voice over still says the old names. I like Yoko way better than Bobo!!",
        "I loved this game, and am V8. So its not like I am against paying. I am against the ranking event especially since you devs LIED TO YOUR PLAYERS and said we wont be getting one again. We will not pay 100s for a non guarenteed reward. It would be more HONEST, if you set up the suits as 300 USD each recharge.  If you are smart at all, devs you should understand that business ethics is just as important as profit and will benefit everyone in the long run.",
        "Lovely game! Gorgeous clothes and gameplay. A little cheesy in. The story but fairly creative for a dress up game. Plus it can be hilarious with how wild the lore gets around fashion. Design can be a little overcrowded sometimes but everything is coordinated so it still looks nice. Backgrounds are gorgeously painted. Tutorial is easy to understand but isnt too tedious. I am officially addicted",
        "I never write reviews, but this game deserves all the praise possible. Downloaded it for my niece and turns out I am the one addicted!! I'm a daily player now and love the fact that you can start your own group for 300 gems and approve applications and interact with your stylist association members. That aspect took the game to a whole new level. The clothing is beautiful and the attention to detail is great!!! Give it a shot and you just may become addicted like myself. I do spend around 20 bucks a week, but it was just as much fun before I was spending money, I just wanted the special clothes for events."

Not to your Facebook account, or Google play game and has problems with it's server. Why any one would spend money on this game until they could at least save stuff is beyond me.",
        "MY STORY OF HUNGRY SHARK  I've been playing hungry Shri since years and I reached my tiger shark.... suddenly it got updated and I lost all my progress and returned to the first level of reef shark...I was so disappointed and uninstalled the game after a few months I reinstalled it and while playing I saw the cloud save and clicked it.....I WAS SO HAPPY THAT I COULD RETURN TO MY PROGRESS....I enjoy playing it and I love the new background and updates  Best wishes- A hungry shark fan",
        "! GOOD !, Arcade style eat'em up game. Feels ALOT like \"Echo The Dolphin\". Except ur a badass shark! The ONLY hold backs is the controls, but u really can't do much about that problem unless u actually had physical/analog joysticks built n2 ur phone.?. The basic control problems u have w/ ne downloadable games.",
        "Addictive, played for hours at a friends house until 3 in the morning. Got it for myself. Gems are costly, but save up and you can get the baby on the last shark. Then get hungry shark world.",
        "This game was awesome but sometimes I don't like it when my Shark freezes up and who came up with all these sharks? It is a fun game but why are there pressure limits sometimes I don't like it but this game is it for teens it's for everyone it's really fun and well sometimes I don't like it when it takes me a long time to get money for a shark",
        "Love the game but in the last couple days, I'll get into a warp and it'll freeze completely on me. And It truly disappoints me because I could've had so many coins by now. I cannot play the game at all with it not freezing and making me start over.. I don't know if it's a virus or what but I wish it would get fixed."

        "I will consider rating the game five stars if you can add new levels and lines, but the \"hearts\" feature forces me to watch ads, even though I paid to remove ads. I will give the game five stars if you gracefully remove the \"hearts\" feature. I'm asking CM a question: \"Will you please change the game back to the original way we played it? And add new levels? 'The Easter' would be creative, and the diamonds can be eggs. How about an Easter Bunny line? I like all the new levels, and the new lines we can unlock. Can you add more remixes to the levels? There are only 3 existing remixes, if CM had forgotten.\"",
        "I originally had it as 5 stars, but I noticed the longer that I've had the game, the more bugs I'm starting to see. Sometimes the music won't line up with the levels, which is the point of the game, and other times the game won't register my touch and will screw up my progress. If this gets fixed that would be great, and I'd move the rating back to 5 stars!",
        "I really wish you guys didn't update it. It truthfully bugs me that I can't listen to the full song on the menu anymore. The songs are absolutely amazing and the game is very addictive. I hope you will update the game again so that we can just sit and listen to these master pieces if we wanted. Thanks for an awesome game!",
        "Amazing game... Loved it...😍 The tunes are AWESOME!!!  And Bryan swag zone At first even I thought that But... It is a maze so it'll obviously be twisted... (No Hate) It is actually that you should click maybe after the third or fourth turn to get it right... Even I took time to understand that So it's okay 😊",
        "The game starts off really strongly and the concept is unique and the music is fabulous.. but later on things get so progressively difficult it makes flappy bird look like a piece of cake... And in the later on levels there's not much sync between the music and the cube it's really hard to play... I enjoyed it initially but now I'm just going to uninstall it...",
        "This is by far my favourite mobile game to date. Loads of fun and not covered with ads like every other game out there (while there is a few this one isn't as bad). My only complaint is the new continuation thing. That wasn't there but now it's forced me to watch ads even though I played to remove ads."

Wasted 3 years of time and data on this worthless app.... recommend not installing or uninstalling it... customer service sucks",
        "Ive played this game a long time. New update and instead of making the game better you screw your customers. I lost all my boosters and you expect me to continue? If nothing else its a matter of principle. You punish me by taking everything ive bought and earned, ill punish you by never giving you another dime and i will let everyone i know who plays or asks about any of your games ro stay away.",
        "Would love to give a better rating, but after the most recent update the game has very bad lag, worse than the usual lag it's always had. Updating this. Was hoping update today would fix the lag. It didn't. Also, adding 2 extra steps in order to replay a stage sucks. You know the old saying; if it ain't broke, don't fix it.",
        "In places with bad connection the facebook popup bug is also annoying and causes you to have to restart, losing lives and the streak. And having to click different buttons to confirm to end a game is stupid design.",
        "EDIT: Update on 3/22/18 fixed NOTHING! New levels still locked as well! Worst update in candy crush history. Riddled with bugs. It didn't add new levels like it should have. Unlimited boosters don't appear on level when they should. And boosters are no longer allowed on lower levels. I'm at level 2100 something. I should be able to use boosters when ever I want! And I should be able to have unlimited boosters appear on all levels, not just when they feel like it. Fix and I will give more stars.",
        "So frustrated with all the candy crush games. I periodically get angry enough to quit for awhile,  but end up back. Why am I upset? I was just in the middle of a rare winning streak and had earned a number of special candies to start games with. I was up to 2 hour on the fish, multi color candy, and the juicy jawbreaker, with 3 hours of life. Suddenly,  i still had the life but all other rewards disappeared. This is far from the first time. I am tired of it. I am removing the king games and I am not coming back this time. I get glitches happen but I have never had any  Indication  that anyone gives a damn. No one makes anything right or even says,  sorry. I'm ok with a game having issues but I am not ok with being treated less than."

        "Well I liked it at first and I really wanted to get the Batman basketball and I've been trying to get it and I was soo close to unlocking it. Then I noticed that they changed the looks and now it looks horrible and stupid I was disappointed by this plus to many damn ads! PS unupdate the app the older version was better the new one sucks!!",
        "I liked this game and I don't mind in game ads, I like money too. But I hate getting stuck in ads you can't get out if and that open other windows.",
        "I don't really like the game because every   time you lose, you need to watch a video to keep on playing .I like it on  the other hand because  it is a challenging game. I might get another game similar to this one but i will have to erase this one. Also, it only gives you a little bit of time.",
        "The game itself is pretty good. But the thing is, there is a point to where it is to much ads. I bet that u make money every time some1 sees an ad on in your game, but u won't make any money if that person stops playing the game because of how much ads. I have been playing this game for 10 minutes and already come across around 100 ads. I might take away some of that cash income because the amount of ads Is insane. Would u rather make No Money, or A decent bit of money?",
        "The game could be better if you tone down the ads a bit more... Maybe 10 games one ad? Or maybe more? Its really annoying when you get ads every end of the round."

        "To anyone saying the magnometer should be free; no, it shouldn't.  You guys are requesting it be free because it is in demand, which is exactly why it is for sale.  Parents don't let you buy things on the app?  Good. The magnometer is something EXTRA that is absolutely not necessary for the app to function.  Sure, it can help make the right move; that's why you have to pay for it... Without the Magnometer, you are playing a free chess app.  With the Magnometer, you are playing a free chess app and paying for it to help analyze your moves.  You are not entitled to a free move analyzer to help guide you simply because you want it to be free.  That's not how economics works, hate to break it to you.  There are many, many ways to analyze moves, positions, and get better at chess; the Magnometer is not and will never be the best way to do so. It is simply an added convenience that you can choose to pay for to help you find or analyze a move/position.",
        "Feels great to have a simulated match with a Magnus-like computer AI opponent. Will definitely destroy you even at the lower age levels. The only thing I don't like in the app is the gray color graphics of the board and the chess pieces. The upside about this is you can surely change that setting if you got the appropriate in-game currency to purchase a different color scheme, with some playthroughs that are needed first to be able to get them.",
        "You know this is the best chess app. The magnus tuned engines works great. You actually improve with each passing day. Few points too. I would have given it 100 stars if possible if the graphic would have been better. The graphic you know, like black and white makes a very depressing combination. Also an option for online game with others would make it a perfect app.",
        "Sound effects and graphics are distractingly poor. Missing basic features like turn confirmation. You can see a video on YouTube of Magnus himself making a mistake in placing a piece using this app.",
        "This chess game is very good, I would give it five stars except for an internal error that will not post my record of wins, losses and ties against Magnus. Maybe I fried the memory with all my losses...😁",
        "the engine is actually good, I gave that 1 star for that, yet the interfaces are sluggish, very clunky, slow, and you can't even change the default board colors without playing a lot of this, with ridiculous brainpower credits.  it's slows down my new smartphone too much when another chess apps are practically lightweight. and without good sides such as analysis or online multiplayer matches."

The kill event being 3 days straight is for the birds . You got to buy gold to purchase shields or you resouces you work for are plundered and often times your army is wounded above your hospital limit so you have to constantly use resouces to be able to heal them.

I would have given it 4 stars if it weren't for the fact that to watch ads to get rewards, I have to give it my LOCATION, ALLOW IT TO MANAGE MY CALLS, and access to my media. Why do you even need my location and phone number to watch an ad for rewards?",
        "Love this time killer. Its a simple game, simple concept. Easy to learn the controls by yourself, and unlock stuff. Simplistic graphics, and will most likely run smooth in any device. Now, the only issue here is, that unlocking a chest is a tad bit too expensive, and gaining coins and stars are a bit hard. Tho, i havent unlocked quests yet, so i dont know. Either way, Awesome game, cant wait for future updates, and i really hope the devs will add new worlds, characters, weapons and customisations maybe?",
        "I love this game in every way. It's a great time killer and it's fun to collect the helmets. The chests don't wait too long to open and the challenges keep you from just messing around. My only complaint is the lack of creativity in the weapons. If I work hard enough to get a new helmet I would like to see at least one unique weapon per helmet. Instead it is a different combination of the regular weapons.",
        "As a 3D MMORPG dev it is hard to find something that is enjoyable on this damned store. However your combination of simplicity mixed with a variety of prefabs and abilitys alongside particles and everything else make this an excellent game. You dont spam ads, you don't make it incredibly difficult and you don't make it pay to win.  A tip of my hat to you guys. I would give this 5 stars if I didn't have a buck fifty skins in my face all the time....",
        "Great game......the only problem in this game is that the lack of information about a weapons..... i wish their are something like a short tutorial about the types of weapons or a short video on what happen if the weapon equiped..... since the game is just currently launch... its normal that it has minor bugs.... but please fix it as soon as the updates come....for a summary: A reallly great game and entertaining",
        "I enjoy the gameplay and various unlock/progression mechanics, but the game is extremely laggy. It may be my device, however. Also, some hitboxes seem to be mercilessly accurate and it can be very frustrating. That may not be something to change, but definitely something to note."

        "Amazing game very addictive...  Love the fact that they have a specials  more often... Also like the events with the second hospitals... Would like if we had special events more often... Just wish we had a platform to save the game my sister had to restart the game 6 times i had to do it twice... Wou be great to save progress on fb or another platform... Even log in  Really frustrating when we lose progress.... I only need 5 more characters then I'll have them all... So if i lose progress again im not starting over  Overall my favorite game on my phone!! Thx",
        "I couldn't get enough patients, I couldn't get enough cash, and my staff energy seemed to drain way too fast. I love the surgery games but you maybe get one of those a day. I ended up uninstalling when room upgrades said they would take 12 hours. Too much waiting, not enough action. I liked the story so far too. Maybe I'll reinstall in the future if the times go down.",
        "It's a great game at first, but it takes so long to upgrade or save money or anything that you end up spending a lot of your real life money. Plus the surgeries all start to be the exact same, and the glitches... oh, the glitches. Zapped $200,000 out of my bank, and that bloody epinephrine shot is impossible to get without striking out. Oh, and $120,000 for research that will only make you $4,000? Why is everything so time and resource consuming???",
        "Controls don't work properly during surgery! There is lot of lag while performing an action while the timer works properly. Moreover, it doesn't allow me to suture the skin, even if I'm trying to do it right (it worked at the begining). Please fix these bugs or I will uninstal the game...",
        "Love the overall feel of this, though some things need tweeking. For example, I only have half of the staff available and am now getting far too many duplicate cards concidering how many I have left to get. Makes it feel all too much like it's pushing people to spend real money, something that always ends with me deleting the game and moving on. Hope this doesn't happen in this case, but I'm not holding my breath...",
        "It's a nice game, I like the concept, you get to operate on patients and manage a hospital. Problem with the recruitment part, it was always giving me surgeons and wasted 200 hearts on the same person. There should be an option if you want to fire someone or replace with another staff. The biggest issue is with their connectivity, internet connection is very stable works with all apps except for this one, no idea why. Fix it please I would hate to delete this game. Thanks."

That cant get in even we need them somtimes we play it and we need a ninja and its not in the box to pick a ninja you will jut restart the game. Anyways but i still love it Ninjago is my  favorite have you guys watch the ninjago movie even there episodes. Thank you for creating this game.👍👍👍👍👍👍",
        "I'm a big fan of lego ninjago♥. Its just hands of time I fight serpentine and when master Wu spoke I saw a timeblade. When I was chilling looking at my mission's then Lloyd hacked into Zane's computer he said something I just have a bad memory.",
        "I think if you could add a few extra spaces for more ninja then everybody would be happy .the reason I'm giving this app a 4 star rating is because you can only have up to five ninja on a mission including your own .if anybody would like that to happen then give this review a thumbs up.",
        "I love the game it's fantastic but one thing can you please have the feature to ride the vehicles or make your own customer vehicle and could you please add where the ninjas are actually following your character",
        "I think the controls are horrible because I Am left handed and you've got to use your right hand to go forward and there is not much of fighting or ningargo feeling",
        "I LOVE NINGAGO LIKE HOW A PERSON LOVES BEING RICH!!!! MY BROTHER INTRODUCED ME TO NINJAGO AND NOW I LOVE IT!! I WAS SO HAPPY TO WATCH THE MOVIE AND NOW THERE IS A GAME ABOUT IT!!!

        "Why I liked it? Because it's a simple game that doesn't make you addicted to phone but rather enjoy going forward focusing your attention entirely on your finger. What comes to music as I read in comments, I always play games without music so haven't listened to this game's. I play this game as a reward after working hard and I'm entirely satisfied. There have been no crashes so far. Lots of ads, though.",
        "I mean the game in itself is......alright  it could be a lot better.  I think the controls are rubbish and I understand it's meant to be \"skillfull\" but thats harder than skillfull, you can't even see where the circle is, this also adds to the game being bad. Having said all this you have also added rubbish music..... like you could have put something decent on. I get even more of an urge to uninstall the game every time I play it. Overall I definitely do NOT recommend this game. Game developers I hope you read this as it will probably help you to make the game better. I understand it would take a while but I don't care. If any of the game developers want to feedback on my feedback you are welcome to.Thank you.",

What is a difference if I buy better worker or he evolve? Maybe to include waiting for raw material after order? Include different sizes of workshops? I have some other ideas as well",
        "This game is really well done. The tutorial teaches you everything you need to know. Its an amazing game and its very fun for killing time. As a machinist my self I like the aspects it puts into play. So good job to the developers its a great game.",
        "What you see is it. Very simple game. Very simple practice. Just s classic build up your base, buy more expensive stuff to make you more money. I don't recommend to download it because of gameplay but because of it's amazing sound track. I LOVE LOVE the techno one that has a very short guitar rift in there. It's music is probably the best for a mobile game and definitely worthy of being a big mainstream soundtrack.  I read some of the reviews. A lot of these people probably aren't smart enough to pour piss out of a boot let alone operate their phone. There is a simple tutorial and even then it's easy to operate. It's not hard to make money like some people it is. Don't spend all your money at once, dumbass.",
        "Irony, factory efficiency game with no automation, zero, none. If you want automation pay $$$. If you want more in game coins pay $$$ so if you cant afford automation and you cant afford currency games done for you. Cant make your own premium currency without paying either. Just a free demo app at this point.",
        "I like the game just wish it was not over priced  There is a machine that will cost me 4000 gold and if i was to buy it cost me 80 bucks real cash to get it with only 1000 left over thats crazy high it be nice to have flash sales that would make more money for the game but also would be nice to have a cash or gold option when buying  The new machines and it be nice if some  Machines you buy will produce gold without spending cash  On the machines that will. lowering the price would be a big plus and a lot more people would be willing to buy cuz my saying is a fast dime is better then a slow Dollar so if they was to lower price they would make a lot more money faster just my opinion and it would be cool if you could do customization to work uniform and do a little bit of customization in the game just my thought on it",

        "Pretty good, would like a little better graphics though, and sometimes when I go to hold it registers as a tap. Maybe it's just my phone. Also I'm not sure how close it is to the PC version (scale and such) and would like it closer. But I know its hard on a phone screen. Maybe if you made the rotation horizon, you can match the PC layout more (with the different sized boards that the PC version has)",
        "I like the app in all, but I have some points I would like the developer to take into consideration. When a new game starts, it would be better to start with the \"mine\" option on and not the flag (so that you can open a new tile and not set a flag randomly), even if the flag was the last option used in the previous round. I also believe that in hard mode the game is made too random and not that skill-demanding. Other than these points it's nicely done!",
        "I love that this game has been ported so smoothly to the phone. The most interesting part of this game is the ads, or rather, the option of ads. In since this game is free it includes ads, but you can turn them of, or change the kind of ad that you get. For this reason, i actually had the ads on, because i think the developer deserves the money he/she gets from choosing such a great system. Sadly i cannot speak for everyone. Good game.",
        "Overall the app is really great. It's the same concept as the original PC version with just some slight changes to make it work for a touch screen. The only downside is that since you're not playing with a mouse you have to click a button at the top of the screen every time you want to switch between planting flags or revealing spaces vs using the right or left mouse buttons. But I see no way around this on a smart phone or tablet. Also, there are very minimal ads, which is awesome.",
        "Input delays keep getting me killed. Instead of marking a bomb my input sets it off. I'd prefer two different inputs for marking or removing tiles.  I'm using a stylus too so I know it's not an issue of accidentally hitting the wrong tile.",
        "Great game. Love it! Sometimes the flag wouldn't place when you pressed a square, and once it selected a square instead of placing a flag, but I still really liked it. Wish there was a zoom because the mini square field is a ton of fun, but a bit small for my fingers. I still love the game though!"

You have to back out and start all over only to have it freeze again. Will probably delete it as it's now useless to try to play.",
        "Frustrated.  I was in the 2000+ level and I just got a new phone.  All of my apps got transferred.  Went to bubbles and it started me back at level 1.  I will be disabling.  I can't start over and I spent money for more tokens.  Very angry.",
        "I don't mind ads, but one after every round is excessive, especially when you can't skip them. Perhaps consider only ads you can't skip when requested, like for bonuses and prizes. I've quickly come to love this game, but I also love plenty of games who get by on much less frequent and interfering advertising. . You're generic response doesn't address anything I said except the target word \"ads.\" I'm talking about ads you can't skip after many levels.  Save the unskippable ads for when we choose to watch them.",
        "Enjoyed the different level challenges -having to drop all the balls with fewer of your own. Do get fed up with adverts at times. One or two won't clear screen and have to shut down game to resume playing",
        "One of the best bubble/ball shooter games. And yes very addictive.  Only 2 negatives... bubble at the bottom unable to move to the left or right as in another favorite game. Secondly there is a creepy ad or something dark that pops up periodically between games.",
        "Between every level guess what? Ads, ads and more adds . I hate it! I understand that ads will help you as developer somewhat but how it will help you if we , users going to instantly uninstall your app and rate it low? Maybe it is time for a different aproach since it is abosolutely anoying that level of ads?"

First adds would take forever to play then they wouldn't play at all and it would freeze up till you closed it out then my whole phone froze up has NEVER happend before. I UNINSTALLED this game and my phone is back to normal. Not worth screwing up your phone. It's a bit fun but there are other games out there.",
        "Game is fun, but it crashed (Samsung Galaxy S7) and lost all progress. Now had to start again (which is not such a big problem), but then the game glitches and I don't get anything for leveling. Meaning I can't get past car level 4 anymore, because there are simply not enough parking spaces. Will give 5 stars if this gets fixed.",

And now it's take me to spam pop ups. Ugh. Gave it  another try anf This one still has potential...but for now it's getting deleted again.",

        "Great little finger friendly app for very little kids BUT..the second you turn the phone or make any movement it crashes and it has to be totally reloaded. Would also be nice if you could erase pics in one swipe without eraser which takes forever on a whole picture.",
        "App looks ok and plays ok, only issue I had was that it crashed my Samsung S7 and shut it off. Only fix was to directly delete install folders from my phones directory.  Other than that, it was ok for my little one.",
        "This game is so awesome. Everytime my sister clocks im on my phone she starts screaming then suddenly she stops. Why? Because i just gave her the phone and she's playing this game. Love it so much plz make another game like that ive got another sister whos 1 and is gonna start screaming too soon😁😁",
        "Amazingly Awesome!!! Dear Entertaining One,Your Game is Really Nice.But,if you can,please add more characters in the next update like Mommy Pig,Daddy Pig,Grandma Pig and Grandpa Pig because I want to see what they do,like Peppa and George.Both siblings oink or laugh,and that's why I want to add more characters.Even though I'm 10,this game is awesome! Again,thank for this game and God Bless You All. Love,Daylight Sunshine"

        "I love this game up until it asked me for a loan for one of the characters for 250 gems that i purchased. I contact Tech support and nothing is being done. After this last update I lost slot. It started off awesome but once I started investing money in the game it's like it just took my money by taking the gifts and coins.  Such a waste of time and money when no corrections are made.  Trying to give the developer a chance to redeem themselves from this error.",
        "I like the idea of changing prices and finding new recipes. I want the barista to automatically start the machines if there isn't one already there. i want to be able to hire another barista. I want to put my menu on the other wall. I want smaller windows. There's basically a lot of things i feel limited on and i still haven't figured out if i can change the color on wallpaper or not.",
        "I watched the 4 adverts and got a no diamonds for the doing so. I also watched the the add to pick a bonus prize, never got a that either. I used to play this game a lot and I've noticed the prices of everything have went up and including the spices. You no longer have the option to buy the cheaper furniture forcing you to spend more so customers come in to the Cafe. Very greedy and game makers. Sort these issues and give me the diamonds I'm owed or take away the ads.",
        "I'm used to like this game very much, addicting and lovely although it is so p2w. After certain update my game will start to reverse progress itself when one message pop out and state \"profile change, please restart\". Recently this problem occur very frequent and its so unbearable and irritating when what u done it just become undone, ALWAYS.  Im so fed up with this and quit for few days, wish developer can fix or lessen this issues or i will just uninstall it one day, thanks for reading.",
        "In the world of cafe games this one is a gem that stands out like a diamond in the rough. Fun and easy to play, it's set at a relaxing pace with you learning new recipes and chatting with your customers. Who are all really interesting people with unique storylines....I think one of them is trying to steal the Mona Lisa,lol.",

        "Lost all of my bikes when I re-download the app. It shows the 500+ wins I have, but I don't even see a way to get the basic ones unlocked again without paying for their stupid VIP package. It sucks that they ruined this app, looking at the iOS version its obvious they haven't bothered to update this in years.",
        "This game is AMAZING. YOU DEFINITELY need it. There is only 1 thing that I hope this game will have, I really want them to have CPU's on multi-player and on tournaments and duels because it says check your internet connection when I try to play them. But still this game is the best. So if you're searching for a game just get BIKE race and you probably won't need any other game.",
        "Overall, the game is OK . But there is a few issues. My bike tips back and I can't stop it from tipping back until I die. But this doesn't happen all the time. It happens about every five weeks. Also, I was given a 5$ gift card and a 10$ gift card but I can't buy any of the bikes.",
        "It's a fun little game at first, but has many, many flaws. You have to link it to your Facebook account if you wanna play all maps. There are way too many ads, they force you to buy their bikes which are ridiculously overpriced and overpowered, so you can't play multiplayer because people who bought those bikes will always beat you. That's just ridiculous. Not to mention it's very buggy. Sometimes you're racing someone who's in a completely different track than you. It used to be fun, now it's just stupid.",
        "Been playing for a few years and absolutely love the game.  Got a new phone, Moto G5 Plus, and now there is a half second pause every time I hit the gas or break in every race.  Extremely annoying when you're racing friends.",
        "Fun game but its lame the only bikes that have boosted stats are super expensive. And it's really dumb that the stats don't scale up with the cost of the bike. They have a range of 100 to 350 with the ultra bike and 300 for the super bike, that leaves plenty of room for various speed levels. The helmet and trick type perks are cool but not enough of an incentive. Need more to play, pay, or fight for."

        "Amazing game!! I have purchased 1 or 2 bikes already, I would even pay to get new bikes, but it is very expensive. Please consider lowering to prices or making better bikes more accessible. Ive been stuck on the same level for 5 weeks. I want to continue playing but im loosing intrest not being able to advance. Maybe you could trade your old bikes in to get something in return for a newer bike. Im sure you will never read this, but you do have something special here! Thanks",
        "Very fun BMX pump game. Seen a few reviews say it's gets impossible after level 3 when it becomes pay to win. I don't agree I've just reached level 8 in a few hours. If you ride bikes off road and understand how to pump you'll love it",
        "Its way to hard to win and and the stats do nothing.  You have to be perfect and even then they fly by.  Still LOVE this game.  Just takes away the fun when you get left in the dust and you play the same lvl a million times hoping maybe one time you will be perfect.",
        "I loved this game for 3 days. Then it got to the point where I couldn't beat a level without upgrading my bike, but I couldn't upgrade my bike without spending real money. So disappointing. Don't waste your time if you don't want to spend real money!",
        "The game is fun up until around the third level. After that it becomes near impossible to win any races without spending actual money to upgrade your bike. Had a lot of fun with it up until that point, but it's definitely not worth spending actual money on. Deleted the game after pay to win clearly became a necessity.",
        "It was fun for a while - until it becomes impossible to beat any opponents with your current bike. The difficulty spikes around level 7 and the process of buying a new bike or upgrading your existing one becomes very frustrating, as you can't win any races to earn any money."

        "The game sets a new high standard in bland average. THE DEAL ISN'T TRUE TO LIFE, IN ALMOST EVERY SINGLE HAND DEALT (in tournaments) THERE IS MULTIPLE ACES & PICTURE CARDS. However for a poker fan that doesn't know this game it's worth the gamble lol. The game play is good, poor player avatar customisation options as it's simply a small selection of picture options with zero options for using one's social media profile pic. This means frequently there are multiple players with the same profile pic. It struggles a bit as a social game of cards because conversation is limited by time, you can sit at slower tables allowing for better chat but not in tournaments. It has nothing to stand it out & above other poker game apps for either negative or positive reasons. If you just want to play a game of poker with random people from around the planet though it won't disappoint. It does give the option to buy top up chips and a daily option to get chips for free from both in game buddies and a poker machine. From the entertainment point of view it ticks all the right boxes but it's not the best poker game on Google's app store. If it was food you'd spit it out because it's bland, not sweet nor spicy but porridge without sugar or sweeteners.",

        "Would be nice if there was a redo button for the last move. I'm very quick when playing and I often misplace a block. Also, why does the Apple version have stars and the android version doesn't? I was trying so hard to earn enough stars to buy the colour packs on my iPod, and I got quite disappointed that I can't do that on android. I guess I'll just delete the game off android since there's really no goal to the game now.",
        "Very fun and addicting but nice calm relaxing game. Ads only happen after each round and not a big deal. If you want to keep playing this game FREE then add up with the package. Quiet whinning about ads. Someonbe has to pay the creators for this game including the upkeep and updates. How else will the creator make his money? 2 choices, either gets ads or charge to download. So I can deal with the ads. It's a FREE APP.",
        "Way too many ads. I just need something for my fingers to do while listening to podcasts but this constantly interrupts my listening pretty much after every round. I really liked the game but I have had it with thw ads and am uninstalling. It's just not worth it.",
        "I really like the game but as many others have said their are too many ads. Ads after every round and sometimes in the middle of the round which makes you start over and that gets annoying. Too many of thr same ads. I also agree their needs to be a redo button. It does get a bit pintle after you hit the goal but still fun.",
        "Too many adds, and it makes me restart every time an add plays, I've only had this app for 1 min, and have already played 50 rounds... Not. Cool. I would be okay with the adds if I could at least pick up on where I last left off.",
        "I'm not quite sure what's happened to this game. It's very straightforward and strangely addictive. However, just today after Android's OS update, it performs much worse. Where before when you pick up a block, it is elevated slightly above your finger so you can see where it's going, now it's just under your finger, making this game frustratingly impossible. If this is due to an interaction with the OS update, then 1010 is due for it's own update."

Can this problem be solved or should I deinstall all king games I have? I have no problem with games from other developers, so this is on you, not on me.",
        "Have played this game virtually since it first started it's a great game but why do we haveto buy the gold bars we have earned throughout the games I have never spent a cent buying anything! Shouldn't most of the gold bars be awarded to us for being loyal gamers ☺",
        "At level 558 I quit this game like 2=3 years ago... Now I don't even remember how to defeat spiders etc... Thought it would be fun to start over from scratch... But of course in these games not even a chance...  Great fun... NO",
        "I enjoy the game BUT.... I payed £2.99 to open the piggy bank to collect my gold bars and when I tried to collect them again, I have a pop up telling me that I have to pay another £2.99 AGAIN to collect the 50 gold bars I have earned from completing each level! Nothing states that these are one off payments and that you have to pay everytime you want to collect your 50 gold bars. I never normally spend money on games and I most certainly will not waste any money on this game again! What an absolute rip off. When a gamer clicks on the piggy bank, I think that the notification should state that you have to pay the ridiculous amount of £2.99 everytime you want to collect your 50 gold bars.",
        "Latest update keeps crashing especially when a level has been won and on the bonus. Crashes to hone screen then the level is lost  and had to be done again. Will restore 5 stars when fixed.",
        "Payments for bricks does not respond with google play . Just says error occurred try later or wrong password. Im already logged in google play atc. I did not make any changes in my account."

        "Fun until you get to Miami.. absolutely impossible to make 100 000.00 to unlock the next level.  Computer outbids or up bids you so that you either give up or lose your money.  No daily incentives to keep brining you back.  Unless you are willing to spend real money for boosters and money to move on.. play to Miami and then delete.. impossible to move forward after that.",
        "The game was addictive and fun until you get to Miami. 100k to unlock that level is absurd and unrealistic. Its to hard to make that kind of money playing and now its just playing the same level over and over trying to get enough. Now its boring!! I'm disappointed, I really enjoyed playing until that point.",
        "Was a great game until I got to Miami level 19 now just bloody stupid & waste of time. I went to 4 straight auctions couldn't buy a unit because competitors bid more than what the units worth how are you suppose to level up & move on when the designers of the game make stupid unrealistic flaws in the game no bidder is going to bid in real life on items they can't see or know are there so why put this into the game? Fix this issue & I will adjust my review accordingly!",
        "Good game. I like the game however  this is the 4th time it has asked me to do a review. I have done this all 4 times with no reward and it still keeps asking me to do  it. Very frustrating",
        "It's good game but would be nice to transfer your game over to other phone with out having to start all over again with out losing ya progress on the game real shame after I had to reset my phone loss everything even progress on game dissipointing to be honest fix this issue then will give it 5 stars"

If you like this, dont whine just pay the piper or play something else.  Develepers have to eat, ya know???  If you want a free alternative, (or if you are curious about how this stuff works) i suggest looking into the open processing language.  You can learn to make your own cool stuff like this by finding a couple of algorithms online   Also, if you have a good graphics card in your pc/mac and you are interested in this stuff  check out touch designer.  You can make some really amazing realtime art  But seriously, support these developers if you like the program.  Its that simple.  99 cents is not much money!!  Ok luvya byebye",

The game is the best dude the only thing for an update you might be working on is putting new songs, like undertale songs, check those out, FNAF 6 songs are already out, also check out those! I like the cool sounds but just make them a bit more of a smooth sound to make it calm and nice not loud and ugly, thank you Opala Studios! If i were you, i would love this kind of an update!!!",

        "I love it.So addicting.I am 1st place on the leader-board. Everyday when I come home from school, I play it but the thing about it is that I don't like when you buy a power-up and then you only have an hour and fifty-nine minutes to use it.To me it is very unfair for me and other players to have that limited amount of time.When I first downloaded it, I thought that when you buy a power-up, you would have it permanently. So please fix that problem. Thank You. Fix the problem right now!!!!!! Fix It!!!!!! I hope you Game Shakers heard me So all you have to do is raise that time limit or just make us have them permanently. One or the other. So just choose One!!!!!! OK? Good I hope you heard me. Good. Bye",

Dont just think \"We got a famous show that will promote our game but we hav no ideas... Oh i got it lets be stupid and plagerize these people r stupid they wont notice. All over FORK YOU",
        "DON'T EVER. EVER  EVER EVER DOWLOAD THIS GAME. This game is a disgrace. This game is a ripoff of a good game called shooty skies. All the \"good reviews\" are from cringey 9 year olds or their parents. Nick has never been good with game. ESPECIALLY in this dark age. Parents go get your kids shooty skies. Not this hunk of garbage. Also (my opinion)  Cartoon network is much better than Nick.",

It feels likes the longer you play the game the less effect your ship becomes. It's a fun game but seems like a pretty intense cash grab.",

You'll end up getting swarmed by every ship that always go faster than you, no matter how much you upgrade speed. They ram You constantly dealing damage but then take no damage from when you ram them. They also aren't affected by friendly fire. You can't actually aim and the constant ads are very annoying.",
        "Easy to play game. Good graphics. Controls can be a bit fiddly, but not that hard to deal with. If playing solidly for a while (30+ minutes), the cannon firing timing stops working properly and all shots miss (except for the enemies!) - restart the game and problem resolves, but a frustrating little bug.",
        "This game is amazing. Hands down one of the best games I've ever played on mobile. Also, you don't need to spend any money! I got to a fully maxed out ships without spending a cent. One thing you guys should add is multiplayer and different style ships, maybe Viking or something. Otherwise great game.",
        "Well I get the concept, but it's just not intriguing enough yes there's fishing, battling, etc. to top it off you get to sail in a really small map & after just 10-15 min I found it quite boring! Nonetheless just create a bigger more diverse map & fix those controls & this game could potentially be a 3 star game."

The dude takes literally the longest route possible to get to the evac! Nearly finished it just to do so but the amount of ads/repeats you have to go through just gets worse",
        "Good but buggy Good but buggy, one can earn infinite money in no time then u can upgrade ur vehicle to the max in the very first level. That destroys the fun of the game. Second if u have money in millions, the cost of the parts are also in million and so on, and even having millions of dollars in the game u might fail to upgrade vehicle sometimes  that makes no sense.",
        "I really like this game and its one that I can play continuously, my only problem is that I can only play once a day.. the game will work for as long as I play but as soon as I exit I can't back on until the following day. It sucks because I have to complete as much of the game as possible in a certain amount of time and that kills the fun. I can't just enjoy it and play a bit then carry on playing a bit later.. please fix this I really enjoy.this game and its getting ruined a bit for me...",
        "I like this game but i faced a problem. When i tried to make a purchase of INR 89.99 for this game,  balance has deducted but no coins or other benefits added in my account.  What is that?  When i searched on google for any helping contact email id or website, there is no email for help.  So tell me,  what should I do? Either solve my problem or i am going to file a case against you. Contact me as soon as possible.",
        "Yesss. I complete this game in 7 days. I can't understand the ending why that cantenar shake. It's mean the zombie are in the cantenar? It's mean part 3 will exist? Awesome game. I feel happy and relef when I complete the game and go on that ship. I think there will be a helicopter because in start there is a helicopter. But nevermind awesome game. Make part 3. Bye..... And I read there is hidden kits? What is this. Why I don't read it before. I can't find any kit. But what is kit? Nevermind I completed the game. One more time. Awesome game. Bye.....",
        "My problem with the gane comes from some sort of bug that started like an ad mid-run, then it started doing some weird rainbow pattern that flipped 90 degrees every few seconds. Now the game doesnt function when you try to start a run and the problem even persisted to my home screen before I closed the application."

        "A great app to download. Great format and graphics. Lots of fun and challenging. Rated everything 5 star other than gameplay. It's good but not great due to the water hazard or out of bounds shots.  Players can hit into the water yet still finish on par. Water hazard should automatically be 2 shots. If this gets changed it would be 5 star no doubt and best golf app.  Single mode would be fantastic to practise",
        "OK I really love this game but all if a sudden I can't play it anymore. I try to set up a match and it just hangs in the loading screen then boots me to the main menu. I have sent 2 emails to support within almost a week and more than 48 hours apart. I have not received any responses. Other than that it is a great game and for the time I was able to play I enjoyed it very much and hope to receive assistance in this matter soon so I can continue to play this wonderful game.",
        "I had to change my rating for this game because I seriously believe it is rigged for me to stop advancing. Everything was great until I made it to pro level and now I'm noticing that whenever I am tied with another player with gems, an extra gem magically appears in the hole making me lose that round. How is it possible that I made it to pro level winning a good percentage of games and now I have played at least 50 rounds on level 3 and can't win a single one?",
        "To many play just to attack your ball after you hit. Regardless if they don't play well they win. A bit eh. The way it's done barely allows you to win. I agree with many others reviews. Something fishy about the scoring system and who you are placed against. Won't keep long if it continues. Could be awesome if it wasn't unfair. O.o",
        "This game is ok at best. More about luck then skill. Fun and addictive, yes at times. Ive collected all the trophies from 3 of the maps and was on a roll. Then out of nowhere a 15 game lose streak. You will get to the point past anger. There are a lot of pretty good/lucky players from around the world.",
        "Overall, game quality is pretty solid. Few graphic glitches here and there but can be expected. It would be nice to rotate to see a better perspective and easier to hit.   One must improvement needed is that when you play a bot, it's way too noticable. You need to improve the bot intelligence! I understand why bots would be needed time to time.  Coins could be cheaper too.  EDIT: Game froze on a Pixel XL, cost me lots of coins! Not happy."

        "Nice game but the random number generator is non existent. Hold three numbers and roll again, even with free or earned additional rolls, are ALWAYS the same number that was there! This would fail state regulations on gambling games. Fun but a sucker game for rolling anything that counts as statistically random",
        "This is fun, IF you can figure it out. I like playing yahtzee but this is complicated. Every time I get extra dice, the ???? spends them or takes them away from me so I don't get to spend them the way I want to. That sucks.",
        "Love the game! But recently did an update for the app now my game glitches out. Takes forever to roll the dice. Only updated the app cuz it said they fixed bugs & made faster well it did the opposite for my app.",

        "Very realistic and nice game. Missions and descriptions are entertaining. Controls are also great.   Can u add more weather effects and timings like sunset, rain, snow etc. The wipers lie unused in cockpit! What abt adding lights to airplanes -nav, position lights? Some real life airline like texture could be added to make it better.        Overall, one of the best bet for airplane enthusiasts!",
        "Well, THAT. IS. AWESOME ! I suggest to continue developing this game...that about multiplayer mode? What about if you can get money from flights , to buy new planes ? That about making new aircraft types? For example: very big planes can take more passengers to get more money but have low speeds? And other planes which are fast but with less passengers ? And best of all, why not if there is a big map which many players (about 1000 maybe) can buy airports , and transport people to different players airports? Please try and make at least some ideas into ACTION! (Not kidding, this can make the game a blast!) .......I am also sorry for people who find this hard but with some practice you can be an expert!",
        "Great game but more issues to address.  The longer flight durations are a real waste of time,  make them more challenging rather than waiting for the destination. Also add more controls as the ones we have are not effective. How do you tell me to slow down yet i don't have the option for that?",
        "Its quite good but a little bit of fixing will do. The part \"Slow Down thing\" can you please please place that where it can not block the view of the player. It is very difficult to see whats behind it so it causes us players to crash. T.Y",
        "Why the hell they add brake when we cannot see the brake option even after landing which forces us to crash. Total stupidity do not waste time in downloading. Previously was better when there were no brakes just reverse it and stop or keep brake button always active.",
        "Its really boring... You have to do missions you cant just fly around and do whatever you have to fly through the squares and make it to the end... And who wants stripes?! Why are they so important?! Plus its really hard to control!!"

        "I reckon this game is so good! I reckon it needs a test mode track so when you finish fixing the car fully to 100% you can test it. And probably alot more cars to fix, and also instead of having just one place where there are garages. You can go all over the world to different type of country's where there are different cars like Australia has commodores, Japan of skyline etc. Love this game so much ❤ hope you take this into exception",
        "Overall the game is exactly what you think it would be, a mobile version of car mechanic simulator 2018. That being said the rotate and zoom features of the camera can be a little irritating at times. It's also very hard to make money to get to your 4th level of tools when you can't completely repair the majority of cars that you get. It can be a little frustrating to purchase a car only to realize that you cannot completely restore it.",
        "Great game and efforts of game generating team are appreciated. I wld suggest to add few things like  tires wheel rims tinted glass at extra cost and if used will pay more while selling. Also sometimes when we buy car from barn in some cases few parts could be made missing so that player wld need to search and then purchase new to add more fun. After u get all tools and all cards then it is boaring....",
        "Trying to find a support link?? I have all tools yet wont give me a bonus.... Love the game. Camera can be a pain sometimes but you learn where to and where not to touch parts. Also why not have buyers or clients stop in... Finishing a car 100% and only making 2k after putting wok into the car Then 10k into parts... I would fire the guy selling cars... Just my two cents.",
        "For the developers: this game is broken. I play on tablet Galaxi tab A   Start the game Remove battery Buy new battery Install new battery Cant tap the sell option Game freeze Nothing work Retart the game 5 times always the same",
        "Nothing like the older apps like this. Camera control is hard, going from warehouse to parts catalogue constantly to remember bad parts to replace is a pain, then an add plays further impairing your memory. Disassembly  got way less interactive and so far I can't repair parts, just  purchase from a catalog."

        "Edit: Fix the controls! Under the default setting the gas would randomly stop working, and while using auto accelerate the nitro randomly activates even when my thumbs are nowhere near them!  Runs smooth and looks great for a retro style racer.  I wish more devs would release games like this, the free game isn't so much a demo as it is a kind of shareware like they released in the 90s.",
        "Lack of game play is what gets me. Don't get me wrong, it's a smart tactic. Offer a free game with *just* enough content to get you hooked then push a \"pay for\" ad to keep playing the rest of the game. May as well call it a trial or a demo mode, that's all it is. Which it's a shame, I'd rather watch a couple ads here and there vs that tactic.",
        "So I downloaded and wound up buying the full version about 6 months ago. Was awesome. Outrun meets Cruisin USA. Loved it, beat it, 80% through trying to get perfect on every course to unlock a different ending mostly just because I want to keep playing and then it updates. Way after I purchased, a whole brand new set of course tracks. It's the best pocket change you'll ever spend.",
        "It was a good game. Too bad it doesnt open now after the update. It says something below the logo screen and then dissapears too fast you cant read it. And when it goes to the gear connecting thing to try to connect it crashes.",
        "Can you guys pls fix the game because when I started to play then while its loading THE GAME GOT CRASH! The oldest version work for me but this version it didn't work. Thx to read this.",
        "It's a great game, it has good graphics and awesome cars. But one thing that I don't get after I have downloaded it why do I still need to purchase it.... really that's not cool....if people found out about this they may end up uninstalling the app....if only you could give it to me for free."

        "I think it is a great idea for a quick game to play when you ate board but  way to many ads. Like every time I missed one of the pink things it would bring me to an ad. If this sounds really formal we are working on constructive feedback in school right now.",
        "Its a really good game. The only thing is, that I wish there was maybe some instructions that appear at the beginning, because I didnt know that you couldnt hit the black lumps etc. Maybe if you add little phrases that say what to do and not to do, then it would be almost perfect.",
        "Great time killer I love everything about it and it is a great game to wake up to. The only down side is that you fall off the ledge and that makes it harder to dodge the black. Everything else is 5 stars so that is what I think about roller coaster.",
        "It a great game but I have a small issue.    Nearly every time I open the app it comes up with this pixilated, almost, screen for about 30s. (I have a screen shot of it) it didn't do this when I first downloaded the game so is this something I've done wrong, my phone or the programmers? Please reply because other than that it a great game.",

        "Before the update, you were able to put your Tamagotchi to sleep and then exit the app. With the latest update, you can't do that. I liked the opportunity of exiting out the app while my Tamagotchi is sleeping so that I don't have to wait awhile for his energy to refill. I've exited out of the app three times after putting him to sleep and three times, I had to return to put him to bed again. PLEASE fix this because I liked it before the new update.",
        "I paid for the starter pack which says it will remove the mandatory ads but guess what, ads are still there. Please do something about it and I will change my ratings.  Edit after reply* wow not even an apology for someone who paid. Kind sir, then please at least let your consumers know that there are actually 2 kind of ads instead of just simply stating 1? No Tom dick or harry will know that unless you state it. Good day.",
        "The only issue i had is the back button when tamagochi sleep. It make auto-wake state when i push the back button. It would be nice if even i push the back button tamagochi still sleeping instead wake up and also option for how long they sleep like 4,6,8 hours. I'll change the rating after the back button issue has fix. Btw the game is good, you should add adventure or something like that.",
        "Good nostalgia, awesome graphics but needs better execution. Allow optional interactivity with friends, for example. The main point of using a smartphone is connectivity. Make earning anything easier, this will increase the replay value. Your game will become popular by word of mouth, I tell you. Don't make it a quick cash grab. Think about how you can keep the game afloat instead of having to scrap it and start anew if it fails.",
        "I did a YouTube video over this app. Overall Tamagotchi Forever is fun. But ads and lack of things to do made this app a miss opportunity for the creators. I do like optional ads. But the ads at the top and in between screens are lame. Also for an app like this cosmetics are the perfect thing to add, but they limit the costumes to about 3 each character. Another nice thing that would've been cool to see would've been decorating your house & visiting friends. These other things would've made the app great.",
        "I can't see ur advise is helping me, none of them. Back button will appear after i press phone's back button. And it makes my pet wakes from his sleep.  And yes, we can collect all of the character but we can't interract with other player, we ONLY can collect and evolve them, not like in tamagotchi v7 if u know what i mean.  Unistalling this game"

Perhaps i used bad tracks but its nothing like rockband blitz. It cant decide jf it ants to be a car racing game or a rhythmic game doesnt succeed at either. Looks neat at least. But hard to tell where tongo next with most graphics",
        "Whoa. I'm not a huge fan of the starting level, but the retro level is so perfect. I love the style of legacy, but It's too busy, so I can't tell where the obsitcles are. I love how you guys do the ads. If there's a car or level I want and I want to be lazy, I can just watch a couple ads to get it. Not only that, but It's my music. What a great idea. Kudos. I'm 100% on board.",

Edit: now the app will not give me the choice of what system I'm playing on. It's stuck on ps4 and I don't even have one nor have I ever set up the app that way. I play this game on xbox one.",

        "I used to love playing just dance, now I hate this stupid game and regret buying it and the Xbox one. Horrible. Can't even get the wire to connect a kinect to it so this is useless. This game is the only reason I even bought a console. Seriously wish I could get my money back!",
        "Update-It started disconnecting a lot.  Now I can't connect at all making this a $60 waste of disk space.  Please fix!!! Very buggy.  Only app that despite being on same network reqquires I reboot the pjone each time to play.   Can't just work.",
        "This is horrible don't ever get this app. Every 5 seconds it keeps disconnecting and you can't even enjoy it. Microsoft makes it to were you have to Kinect to play just dance. Also now Microsoft doesn't even sell Kinect anymore.",
        "Great app saves me hundreds of dollars buying Nintendo switch controllers. To all the peeps saying boring, how about you stop playing the 1 song demo and buy the full game. You all so retard."

The program component can be a standard score from the AI judges yet will be under review by fans (other players who can add to the overall score, max 4 points only). Lastly, there should be a season that features state, regional, national, world, and finally olympic competition based on the current judging system for the short program and free skate [150-164 meh, 165-174 is okay, 175-189 is very good, 190-199 is excellent, and 200+ is \"strictly Russian\" (Weir, NBC 2018 Winter Olympics)]!

Also i dont like having to pay to get the thinks and to many thinks are whach a vidio to get the thinks it takes to long so i dont l0play it that often. I hope u understand what I'm going through please fix the game up a bit 😄",

The game started off very well and easy to navigate. Ease of controls. I will uninstall as there isn't much point keeping this game when it has already failed itself.",
        "Let's be honest here. The concept was very creative and unique, but the game was very poorly designed. The slide is not smooth and   feels very unstable, I wasn't able to enjoy playing the game. The graphics are very low and the game itself is slow. Apart from that the idea was very well thought of but I feel you should have added more time and professionalism into the whole design, the game has potential.",
        "One thing I find annoying is the adds! The game itself is addicting, but every time you die you have to sit through these long adds. I guess you could pay for the game without adds, but if your like me and you don't really like spending money at the app store, patience my friend... the game is worth it...",
        "I really like this app but the the amount of ads are crazy! Wayyy too many. On a good note, the personalisation. I really like the different range of balls and the night time vortex, where everything stands out, and is all black. The trails are really neat too! Although the ball is quite sensitive when dodging around the obstacles. It is still great! I got a score of 104 on my second go! I'd definitely recommend this app! Also i have the samsung galaxy s4 so you can definitely 8nstall this if you have the same phone as me!😊",
        "It is shuting down again and again, in starting that  heppen after 2-3 min then under 1 min and now I open and it shut down in few seconds. For my Moto x play runing 7.1.1  Love concept and game environment.  Control is fine.  Graphic are good.",
        "It's hard to control and there are WAY too many ads. It lags so I'll be doing fine but it'll make me crash because it paused for a brief moment. If all this was improved, I'd love it. I love the concept of the game but everything else sucks."

It is such a cool concept with little to no support or point.  Why gather the materials if we can't use them?  Plus, it took weeks to get the stuff.  Like most cool games, nothing more than a good concept.",
        "You had my attention, and now you have my money. Yes, this is a good game. However, it costs too much real money to advance this game. There are many missing pieces and too much to acquire to be able to progress. Maybe instead of making it so in depth, take it down a notch. Let people use junked cars to fix cars and sell them, if this is already an option make it easier to do so. I think this is a good game just too in depth and not enough give to make it entertaining and fun at this time.",
        "Great game with good potential. I love it. But there are still some minor bugs the car baler somtimes acts weird. And the dismantling process sometimes goes reverse. And then there is the part of collecting building materials. It is too hard and we need to be able to get building materials from elsewhere than the scrap cars. All of them including wood, bricks, and concrete. I am looking forward to the car repair function.",
        "The game is over good. It's definitely fun for your car enthusiasts but I am now level 11 and I can't obtain \"glass\" to build any buildings... The game is getting boring because I can't move up, it's pretty much scrap cars and sell parts... I don't want to rate this game too high because I believe it still is a work in progress, but yes it's a good game and I would recommend it",
        "It's a decent concept. Good time killer for a little while. I don't know why all these games take energy. Just let me play the damn game. And the constantly fluctuating prices to sell the parts got old REAL QUICK! Apparently the creators of this game have never been to a salvage yard in their life.",
        "Great time killer! Simple to play, though a few information/help would be nice for a few items, the auto sell option and the bailer so you know exactly what they do.  The developer does listen to the players and fixes things! Only true issues that I have are 1)the materials needed to build the buildings in incredibly high, not really obtainable for game play, even for someone who would play constantly"

I could play this for a whole day and think 10 minutes just went by! I loved this app so much! Thank you for making a good app. Well... I have nothing else to say except It's amazing, I suppose I'll play it for another hour!   I Liked it!",
        "For what this app is, its full of adds. There are adds when you are playing at the bottom. Then every two or three selections ypu are blasted with 15 to 30s unskippable adds. Often loud vidoes wasting data. I do not recomend you download this blatant addware app. Its fun and novelty quickly gets replaced with advertisement. And you become a monkey watching adds rather than participating a very simple game of would you rather.",
        "I can't believe anyone can think this is playable with this many ads. A simple text based question game with more ads than gameplay. Pathetic. I can't believe how much this upset me",
        "It is an addictive and nice game but only one problem. There is an ad like every 5 seconds and it is really annoying. Please fix this then I will rate 5 stars.",
        "It's good but you need to add more detail not just plain questions add like voice chat to a person will say would you rather to me. It's like good but you need to add more stuff to enjoy and it's also boring..",
        "I think it is quite entertaining to play when there is nothing else to do. The questions are easy so you end up being a little bored. Overall, I like it. Recommend it to anyone."

Frustrated at looking for bizarre words that are not even English? Struggled with grids that are inappropriate for your device or difficult to read? Word Search Ultimate solves all these problems. You can configure:1) Grid size    Specify exactly how many columns and rows to use (from 3 to 20). Even non square grids (e.g. 12x15) are possible.2) Screen layout    Choose how much screen space for the grid and how much for the word list, using our unique movable split bar.3) Difficulty of the game    Specify approximate proportion of words that are written diagonally, backwards or vertically (e.g. allow no diagonal or backwards words, ideal for introducing children to Word Search).4) Difficulty of the words    Specify the size of the dictionary to generate a game, from the 500 most common words (good for kids and language students), up to 80,000 words.5) Maximum # of words    Choose the maximum number of words to find in one game, from 1 to 150. This will provide enough words to fill a 20x20 grid.6) Minimum & Maximum word length    This helps avoid searching for many small words (a common problem in word apps). Also useful for specifying really difficult games (e.g. set both minimum and maximum word length to three).7) Highlighting    Mark the already found words, or keep the grid unmarked and easy to read.8) Word list layout    The word list can be arranged in columns for easy reading, or close to each other to minimize screen space.9) Language    Choose the language of the word list, from a large range of downloadable dictionaries.  24 languages are currently available (see below).10) Orientation    Can be played in portrait or landscape mode. Just rotate your device and the display adjusts automatically.11) Word categories    Choose the words to find from a range of categories; e.g. animals, food etc.This app gives you the ultimate power to play the game just the way you want.Each game is assigned a difficulty level from 0 (easy) to 9 (very hard). The difficulty level is determined by the settings. Each difficulty level maintains the high scores (measured by fastest time to complete the game). The game displays the best 20 scores for each difficulty level.Compare your high scores with others around the world by using Google Play's \"Game Services\".Other features unique to this app:1) Two methods of selecting words: (i) the classic swipe (ii) by touching the first and last letter of the word from the grid.2) Game aid if you are having difficulty. You can choose to reveal a word that you cannot find.3) View the definition of the word from an online source (e.g. Wiktionary), optimized for viewing on a small screen.4) When you play with a word list in a foreign language, the word definition will (where possible) be in your own language. This is great for language learning!Additional Features planned for a future version of this app:1) Blind mode.  The word list is hidden. Instead you must find the words within the grid.

        "The game controls are very annoying. The character won't go where you want him to. During the boss fight he keeps getting stuck near the door even though I press the control for him to move forward. Plus the controls on the right hand part of the screen are too close to the controls on the phone, so if your finger moves a but too much other apps are popping open when you don't want them to and the game app is closing. Found the jumping upward on level 2 very awkward. Character didn't want to move forward during the jumps. So your continuous trying to climb and starting over if you miss a jump.",
        "Maybe the reason people think its boring. It's probably because they are boring and lame. I beat the first level without a problem, they didn't because they feel like everything should be easy and they shouldn't have to work hard for anything. The game is challenging and fun if you like a challenge. If your a lame, whinny, expect nothing to be hard, and can't handle a challenge as tough as making toast, then this game isn't for you.",
        "These other reviewers are jerks! Lol. The game is awesome! And my 4 year old can even play it well!  I like it so much, I'm downloading it onto my phone (4 yr old plays it on my old phone)  just to see how far I can get lol",
        "NC and you know what you doing today beautiful lady and her husband to be with u but I can't wait till I see you in the car and my mom said she will be here for me to go to the store and get a chance to get a chance to get a chance to get a chance to get the money for the first time I was just wondering if you want to be a good day at work and I don't know what I",
        "This game is stupid because you have to get a part of the key just to get more lives and the bad guys are technically cheating because they have guns I made it to the last level and it was impossible to beat the boss because he puts fire everywhere on the second level the guy keeps shooting you so it took me an hour to get off that stupid level  it took me about five days to get of the last level but I suggest that you just play the first level. This was a ripoff it doesn't make sense to wait that long for a stupid freaking game I'm to cool for that dumb game. Another thing that is stupid about the game is the remote controls its confusing because they all look the same they should put the names of what that control does in the buttons. And the thing builds the stuff for you at a scale of 1 to 10 I pick 1  I rather play with realistic legos than the iPad ones don't waste your time on waiting for the game to download  its a ripoff",
        "I would get to the title page and that was it. It won't let me go further. I have turned my phone off and back on and I have uninstalled it twice and installed it 3 times. Please fix."

        "Excellent card game.  However as soon as you get passed reasonably priced starter packs you cannot play the game and why not?  Because you play two games then you need to spend huge amounts of money so you can play two more rounds.  Then you need good cards and guess what you have to buy them through a lottery system like gambling highly addictive but after maybe thousands of dollars you get the card you want guess what you need to evolve your card and guess what you need to buy your reagents big dough yet again.  Then when you have spent all your hard earned cash you need to buy special weapons to give yourself a good boost to your cards.  Do you get where this game and a right game it is too. It relies on you getting addicted so you spend all your time and resources on an endless quest for something you will never have uninstalled buy buy.",
        "Amazing game, honestly, top 3 mobile game I've ever played, found an amazing guild and it's loads of fun. No paywall is the crowning achievement in my opinion. One thing, cause I don't know where customer support is, I started a Path of Champion level, and  on the first wave the game crashed and when I logged back on I had no key and didn't have a chance to beat the level",
        "Definitely pay to win. When you scroll up or down it thinks you are clicking on something. Stamina is a nightmare as when you reach a high enough level that takes more xp to level up, you can't play for hours as it takes to long to recharge. Should make gems easier to get for non paying players so it is more fair. Other than that pretty good.",
        "Number one of the best games I have ever played on my phone. I'm watching ads for bonus experience when sacrificing my cards. And I love the fact of that availability. Especially since it pays them which increases chances of more games like this one. Keep up the great work. Really helping my cognitive development of pattern recognition",
        "Great games. Controls suck.  You want to scroll and click a card instead (i know how to swipe) turns are fast paced..sometimes too fast. And as a starter...some of the turn challenges seem a bit unrealistic with the characters provided. Almost like they want to have you spend money off rip. Good game overall....but some things should definitely need work.",
        "It's a lot other games of this type. I haven't been able to find a problem with it yet. Great graphics although the timer is a bit fast when you're looking up connections. If you had a button that the players would push when they couldn't find any more connections, that would be great!"

        "It starts really easy then you have to be almost an achitect to even finish the next 5 levels. Way too hard and unrealistic. Terrible game and I would not reccomend it to anyone.",
        "I enjoyed this game for about the first ten levels. It's fun and almost educational about civil engineering practices. However, after the first ten levels it becomes an infuriating cacophony of balancing your bridge on rocks and mountains without anchor points and hanging your bridge from hot air balloons. Levels become so frustratingly impossible that you are forced to watch the videos for hints to get enough stars to progress.",
        "This game is simply great. It may have adds but they are expected in a free to play mobile app. The adds are easily controlled and aren't annoying at all as they can be easily closed and come in moderation. The gameplay is smooth, the graphics are cool and it's very fun and addicting. Perfect to pass time. The developers done a great job, hope for me great games made big these guys.",
        "Good game. Too bad steel wire is so expensive it's almost never useful.",
        "A good basic bridge builder sim. It is somewhat dialled back / optimised for touch screen, but works ok and the first few levels are easy enough to get the hang of. Enjoyable and worth a try :)",
        "Very good game makes you think and if u don't know well that's why there are hints."

        "The art style is amazing. The Zen mode and overall atmosphere is relaxing and entertaining. My big issue is after resetting my progress once I completed everything. You loose the coin doubling upgrade that you pay real money for. Why must I re purchase some I have already bought. Why does resetting my progress reset something I purchased with real money. I feel that is a little unfair and even from a premium purchaser is pretty jading, I really enjoy the game and will change to a 5 star once an answer is provided or it is fixed.",
        "Alright, so the game is pretty good. All I ask for is more tricks, and the ability to upgrade some bonuses (coin magnet, feather hover thing, and the third one that I haven't grabbed yet.) All in all, if you could do that, it'd make the game so much greater. Apart from skipping missions and revives there's no use for coins.",
        "The thing that makes this game great is the visuals and the audio. It is absulutley beautiful and the art style works so well with the type of game. Without this the game would not be nearly as good as the game play I'd very simple but it would still do ok. However these features are what makes the game. Also the fact that there's a night and day feature gives the game an even bigger opportunity to show the beauty of its art style",
        "Echoing what many others are saying, the ads completely break this game. I understand I'm not paying for the game, so I don't mind being shown ads.  However the button to close the apps rarely function properly.  Instead of closing the ad it takes you to the download page of the ad being advertised. Update: I just had to sit through a round of a final fantasy game.  I wish you could rate below the 1 star.",
        "The game itself is fun and minimally challenging.  The graphics are lovely.  I felt compelled to give such a low rating due to the ads not clearing out upon completion.  I had to close the app and restart just to play the game again.  I would have purchased the ad-free version but if it's this buggy prior to purchase, I didn't want to get stuck with a pay version that I'm unable to clear out certain functions.  Maybe next time.",
        "I remember back when this game would cost money on iOS. I would literally try to download every single third party helper app just to look for this game. Now that i actually have a phone, its free. I think this game is great for both relaxing and competitive play. And I am so hyped for the Odyssey. I check often to see if it is there. 10/10 would recommend this game."

I am enjoying this relaxing, mind game however, I had to reset my phone and all my progress was lost...not cool! I've contacted the developers / company twice with no fix offered yet.😔😕 Hoping to get an accommodation and a way to avoid this issue in the future!",
        "This is a pretty awesome app which makes our mind to formulate words with the given letters. But many a times we come across words for which we are unaware of the meaning. If you guys can create a small block on the screen which displays the meaning of the last word created/accepted. Then this app will become an ultimate learning app or say vocabulary building app as well. Hoping to see the enhancement is sometime near future.",

But recently bought a new phone and even though I signed into Facebook it did not save me levels coins or anything else that I worked so hard to get. It reset me back to the beginning. So never buy a new phone if you don't want to start over.",

        "The advertisement I saw for this game, WASNT EVEN THIS GAME. I downloaded it expecting a different time of word game, looked like a whole bunch of Scrabble word tiles lined up and you'd choose words. This game is nothing like that. Its ok, but very misleading advertisement and disappointed in that.",
        "It's fun and cute. I like that it gets harder as you progress. Edit: March 17th, 2018. There was an ad after you completed a level and that was fine. That's how it was last night and usually the ads were quick. Now there is an add at the very bottom of your game which really makes it difficult to concentrate and you accidentally click it every time you shuffle your letters. This was 5 stars, but now it's going to have to be 3. That, to me, is very annoying and eventually I'll stop playing altogether as a result."

The only thing ive noticed is the levels seem to have stopped introducing challenges and are sometimes just not possible to beat without serious coin. But that doesn't mean I plan to stop anytime soon hahaha.",
        "I really love this game. I downloaded it for mindless stress relief in between classes and it has not disappointed. Some of the levels are really tricky, I think in an attempt to get you to buy more balls. But that's not too much of a complaint. I bought the full version and it's worth it to be add free.",

I'm missing clearing it by one ball each time so then I'm watching ad after ad to avoid restarting the level. It's really disappointing how much that one thing has made me abandon the game and uninstall.",

Meaning you need to pay to do them. I really find it a nice read but since the books are few i'm on hold on purchasing diamonds. I guess once a series is completed i'm willing to buy diamonds to replay that game. For now i'm just browsing the game and taking notes on how many diamonds are going to cost per book.",

But still this game is awesome, I recommend this game for you. You should download this app and try it."

        "Good I hope they fixed the bug where you double buy a car and it gives you the same car but still takes your money. But its still a great game. Ohh! And also raise thr chance if getting a legendary I played for almost a year and I never got one l. My friend got one all the time on his apple but there Is a glitch with android.ive never had one.",
        "Good, but has some bugs I'm sorry if I'm being too critical in this review but especially on Mobile Data, Smashy Road can lag. This is to the extent the game will no longer work. Moving on to a positive, the graphical interface is very nice, the perspective, movement and background vehicles is very well created.  Very good game overall",
        "It's good but... I enjoy playing this game, there isn't too much skill involved but it's a good way to kill time and it stays easy enough to make it enjoyable while raising the difficulty.  The only thing I want to see is no more of this, automatically backing up stuff. When you are nose first in an object, the game automatically backs you up, but I've lost countless games because it doesn't stop or doesn't back up enough. Let me choose when to back up!",
        "Awesome It's a very good game, great graphics even for a bunch of cubes, but I also have an idea. You guys should make a game called smashy water, where we can choose from a wide variety of different boats that run away from boat police. Hopefully I helped you with my idea and I will download if made;-). You can work on the title if needed. Please reply:-)",
        "Excellent could use weapon pickup like smoke machine gun or oil slick.... A health bar which is unique to each vehicle depending on if it is made for speed or for just ramming stuff and an add health pickup... a bouncing red or blue stack of cash equal to a hundred dollars once action picks up and a 1000 dollar pickup after a ten minute counter for those who have gotten very good and lastly an arrest count down when stopped.... Sometimes you get only a breif second to get away other times you get like ten seconds???",
        "Good but... you can sometimes glich and get trapped but it's a good game anyway like you run from police. Also when you start off you have to press right or left to start so you can't go straight forward when you get on. I really liked it though it is one of my favourite games! I'm out  Later ima go play some Smashy Road now!"

        "The reason I gave it a low rating is because this, I've had two friends she my code for an extra life and it didn't work either time. To make it worse, I've emailed them twice now about the problem and they won't get back to me on the issue. Other than that though it's not a bad game. The host talks a lot but what trivia game host doesn't?",
        "Stupid Wont let me use extra lives. Force closes randomly while in the middle of it and sometime when it starts make u miss your chance then tried to use extra life. This app sucks needs to fix force close parts. Screws me out of chances",
        "This game is so much fun to play independently and with a group. The only problem it will sometimes lag but I'm sure that's being fixed. My only two suggestions are that you can add a place where u can watch back old games because the host is so funny it would be a shame to miss out. Another would be to create a version where it is a group mode that you can play between a group of friends for fun. (Separate from the live game) Overall this game is amazing and it's amazing that there is a game everyday😊",
        "The questions are very hard!! It's fun even if you don't win! But it would be nice! Sometimes the game lags and boots me out of the game. Once I got the answer correct but the app still eliminated me! I wish they would rotate the music. Wow the pots are growing!!! Why not instead of getting extra friends for extra lives, have 3 or 4 chances to get the correct answer?",
        "The game is constantly lagging, freezing and glitching. Also do not like that I cannot change my answer even when I still have time left. The platform needs to better support the number of players that are logged on at the same time, or have a limit to the number of players so that it doesn't freeze. Cannot play properly."

        "Microtransactions riddled garbage. Fun game but you need to play some levels like 100 times or buy stuff. i was about to play some games but after this I don't want to play anymore. Gaming on mobile is joke",
        "Fabulous game! I absolutely flew past all the episodes and the online save feature works fantastically well. I successfully recovered gameplay from about 6 months ago. I got back my progress and all my gold. One of the best games out there :)",
        "Definitely a relieving break from the onslaught of talking Tom spin offs.. This game here is the most redneck tower defense kind of game you could get, and I love that. It's a standard shooting tower defense game, but with variety in enemies and even multiplayer! Who woulda thought?",
        "IT can be scary because it fell like you go lose but then it fell. Better because you won i JUST GOT THIS GAME 🎮  2min ago and am on leavel 5 GANG GANG AM A GIRL",
        "Fun best game, easy to play and all i can say is fun as hell. I guess i could be more fun if you add some gore effect or blood splat. Super fun if you can see the bullets hit them.",
        "I've loved this game for such a longtime!!  I always make sure I download game whenever I upgrade to a new phone...it doesn't bother me to start all over bcuz I could play this game from beginning to end everyday!!  Game actually allows u to start where u left off but many times I choose to start from beginning..i wonder if there's ever going to be a sequel to swamp attack...swamp attack 2, swamps revenge??  Lol...i HOPE SO!!!"

That means you can progress through it without even spending a dime. Its a simple game with decent graphics to play at leisure and has become my current pass time.  Update 3/22/18  I decreased my rating to three stars (from 5) until the developer can correct the latest flop from most recent update. Flop regards being able to log in but paralyzed from any action that requires an in game pop up. I including the \"Help\" module which is used to contact dev with. If no improvement after a week, I will delete game and draw stars to 0.",

The game is starting to suffer because of bad customer service. Reduced my rating to 1 star until they get their act together. To think I've actually spent real money on this game and can't get a timely answer.",

I cannot even access the second world I play in because I am locked into Uceria. I have uninstalled and reinstalled,but still does not work. Please help!",

I really loved but I wasn't able to play it again. You guys should update it to where your able to play the game whenever you want and not havw to pay for it cause the game is the kind i was looking for, for a long time. This is just disappointing.",
        "Love this game and the horses!!🐴",
        "I enjoy star stable horses, it's an enjoyable game. However I have two suggestions.   Firstly, the first horse a player transfers over to their account should be either free or cheaper because, not every player is a star rider and not everyone has as many star coins as a star rider player. So I believe this would make non-star rider players find star stable horses enjoyable and more satisfying once they've reached level 10 and transferred a horse to their star stable online account.  Secondly, there could be a star coins daily spinner. This of course should not be accessible to star riders and only available to non-star riders who do not have the money to buy star rider or star coins. The daily spinner could increase the star coins amount maybe 5% a day possibly till a certain day, for example day 10, and if the player misses a day, the spinner will reset to day 1.   Overall, I love this game, it is fun and the horse's graphics are amazing. The tasks are quite easy to do and not too complicated for younger players. I look foward to future horse and updates with star stable horses.",
        "I love how you let  us get 2 horses, but we should be able to keep the horses without signing in for star stable online. Also, why do we have to wait 24 hours 2 train our horses. But any way it is a GREAT  game!🐎🏇🏇👍👍👍👏",
        "I'm giving up!!. Can't get through most of the training tasks. They don't help or update. Boring as hell. You do the same thing over and over again. Horse is pretty, but the game's not worth playing.",
        "OK so I played the game got two f Different horses to level ten thinking it would be free or at least cheaper then a horse from the online game but no they cost more just to transfer them not cool you guys not cool"

I REALLY miss the Chinese restaurant when I played that one I loved the doctor panda games and I really miss it.if you could can you PLEASE bring back the Chinese resturant.then I will love your games again😀😀😀",
        "Its a fun game but im very disapointes that you barely have anything to do they want you too buy so many things but it is a fun game but you can only make 2 dishes inthink maybe 1 but i was exspecting more from dr panda i love his apps i play them when i wanna play something but not harcore so if your fine with small content get this but if your looking for more i do not recommend this game but it has some good content you can season it however you want overall it was an ok game but i was expecting to be able to do more buts itis fun but if you want full content go to amazon underground or i think its free on this download toca kitchen 2 its great u make drinks as well thx for reading",
        "I'm sorry, but you guys are basically obsessed with money.I know, people need money for their needs, but why make a game free when we can hardly do anything?I miss the Dr. Panda Chinese Resturaunt, the whole game was free!Look, i'm not a cheapskate and the other people who disagree with the prices aren't, but y'know most kids play these games, and their parents aren't wealthy.Just please think about my comment for a while.",

It is confusing if you pick paint or something it just goes back to the original colour. I didn't like how easy the drawings were and I don't think the glow art works. It just comes out as crayon. I wouldn't recommend this game if you don't like colouring. It's ok!!!!",
        "I think there should be more cartoons to draw and color. And it should not always be right colors to trace it in. Also i think that one small part of the picture shouldn't color the whole background, because what if you didn't want them bother the same exact color, because no affence, but it looks weird and ugly sometimes. Sorry for no compliments.                    LOVE, YOUR DEAR FRIEND!!!",

        "It's a great app however it keeps crashing and I have to start the drawing all over again. The whole app stops and my drawing starts over and it's really annoying. If this gets fixed I will definitely rate 5 stars",
        "It keeps crashing it doesn't help at all there are like 10 characters I'm a girl so I don't like pokemon I'm an 8 year old so I'd rather have older  girl characters and you can't choose the colors to draw with.There is nothing good about this don't download this if you are  older than 5 years and your a girl and your not babyish",
        "Well the animals are cute and the drawings are cute, but I thought you could use the rainbow color like in the picture,but you can't😢you should still get this app and definitely of you like drawing. It's still fun though!😆"

        "Its world best game ever played.  It is like a small GTA of phone or for android. It doesn't look too good but if u download and play it will like a real GTA. It is a quite big but the game is super amazing. It is not too interesting in starting but later u can play it like a GTA. It also not need any extra files to download after downloading from play store but it needs Internet connection.",
        "This game might not look so good when you download it, but there is a lot you can do. Buy properties to get money, buy guns armor, cars. There are plenty of minigames and quick play missions like street races, survival, and parachuting. The storyline may only be decent, but the missions are still fun.  The only real problem is the file size. You have to dedicate too much of your storage, if you have a newer phone with more built in storage, or a microSD card, you should try this game.",
        "Great game thanks. as smooth as we like it well-done. To google players if you are  looking for action GTA 5 style then this is the game for you. I can't wait to get home from work every night make a brew and chill on this till I run out of battery lol class A game. (Again thank you for making this game) can't wait for updates fingers crossed",
        "Huge Kudos to the developers for making this game!! It's amazing it's literally like playing GTA but on your phone it has the story mode and it all makes sense!! The graphics are ok but I'm sure if they made this again in a Los Angeles version of some sort the graphics could get better and better!! Overall Amazing game and there's nobody else making games like this on the app store!! Great job! 10 out of 10 stars!!!",
        "Wow this game is so fun! when you go the airport, there are planes yay! and one thing you have to add to the game, please add some more hotels that are in the real Las vegas and I love the daily bonus and the one thing I hate, the military base where you get killed by a jackalope tank, bustard helicopter and the iron horse and please make the military base free to enter without getting 5 stars note: version is 3.6",
        "Best game I've ever played! In fact it is the only game I've had on my phone for 2 years. But there are some minor errors that keep occurring, such as when you are running or driving any vehicle, the control pad keeps stopping and I have to lift my thumb up and put it back down to regain control. Now I know it doesn't sound like much, it can mess up your drifts and the gas will stop as well. PLEASE FIX. Thanks"

        "Awesome game! Only issue is on season 7. Race with save 8 seconds on perfect drift.... it says 3 laps but one lap doesn't count so you have to do 4 laps and you can never save 8 seconds. When crossing finish line game keeps playing and doesn't finish, time runs out and you've lost. Please fix",
        "The car will control itself... If you hold left it will turn left for a period but will start to try and straighten up... To test is on lvl 1 first corner accelerate and turn left (any set of controls tried all) it will start turning right seems to be when the prospective changes. Looks like it would be good if it went where you tell it to. Might be due to latest patch so will try again if it get fixed",
        "Awesome Game... no need to spend money to get best cards you can easily earn them... Can play offline too... There is a glitch though in season 7 - save 8 second stage... even after finishing it wont give 3 stars and fails me.",
        "Good game, really fun. On season 7 the 6th drift game you cant pass it. When you cross the finish line it says wrong way and doesnt let you finish the gane to get the last star. You end up doing 4 laps, even with 20 secnonds still on the clock. Please fix the issue so I can complete the season",
        "Kinda hate the drift feature, like the car just auto drifts in the direction u turn. This gets annoying too since u can't turn normally when needed and the car just starts drifting, making u hit more obstacles. Graphics are good, my phone can handle the very high settings so I haven't played on the lower settings.",
        "Love the game. However, after finishing the race, an ad pops up and after closing it, the screen is all black and it stays that way. It happened to me a number of times. The stage is complete but I didn't get any of the cash rewards or the cards. Please fix this or at least give me the rewards I didn't get. Will give it a 5 stars then."

Words cannot fully express what this game means to me! Thanks to the developers I look forward to playing everytime. The music is wonderful! I highly recommend this game. Thanks again ♡",

I would much rather pay a one time license fee that this crabby implementation of user annoyance  / advertising. The other problem is that on the high end phones (read pixel 2) the board are so big that the tiles as a consequence are made very small so they fit with a final result that makes it very difficult to see/read",
        "The ads are very annoying and I have lost interest in playing  the game anymore. I have to start over for each play. Ad won't let me continue. Someone has Really messed this game up. Just fire their butts and send them down to the river swamp. No need for them to be in the public when they can't leave well enough alone.",
        "I think the game is great. I love Mahjong. I'm unhappy that I paid 1.99 to stop the ads but when I collect my 2,000 coin bonus I still have to watch an ad to receive the bonus. I will not be paying 1.99 next month just to still have to watch ads.",
        "The latest update places advertising banners in the play area. You can't move them or play around them and I don't want to install the advertisement app.  They suck out loud.",
        "Does not even lay tiles down in a solvable fashion. Had no repeats thus shud be solvable in any order, wasn't, what's the point? Sort ur algorithm out.  Also, non stop ads and u want us to pay monthly for ad free? £8 one off fee wud b highest I went for an app I'd want to keep"

I am happy to see the opportunities to gain more spells. Though when it takes me a week to get through a board and I have one more bird,ghost etc. The ball is almost always the wrong color. Yea, snark.",
        "Very good bubble game, best of bubble witch games I've tried. Fun story. I Like the cat tree and building areas for cats, just takes a long time to earn enough stardust to develop new areas. Game fairly generous on gifts tho I do pay real money too. Great to see the older version of the owl bubbles in the games have come back. They are so much nicer looking and easier to spot than the new ones you tried in February. Thank u 4listening to feedback."

        "Gave one star less because the missons lack mathematical accuracy There was this level to travel 8 kms in 130s and it was showing it an easy mission with a bike of top speed 172 kph 😂 The graphics and gameplay are superb I like the game",
        "There are some idiot missions such as combo overheading. I would give this game 5 stars if not those missions.",
        "I can't stop playing this!! The missions are really hard and thats what makes it fun! although i almost threw my phone twice. but this game is amazing! the graphic is good too!"

        "I love this game, it's simple and sweet. However, there was a middle row in the item-picking menu in which I had invested many coins into to help me level up faster. Today, when I logged in, the row simply disappeared without a trace. I tried restarting my phone and clearing the backgrounding of my app, but nothing seemed to fix it. Now I only have the Training row and the Fun stuff row. It took me quite a while to get those coins and I'd really appreciate it if you brought the row back or gave me a solution to get it back. If it helps, you should also know that the 'I' on every icon which used to let you see how an item was used has also vanished. Please fix this, thank you.",
        "I wish I could give this game 10 stars. It's amazing all around.  It's adorable and fun. The graphics are amazing too without any glitches so far. Haven't noticed any bugs either. The developer's done amazing. It does get repetitive after a while but so far by the time it happens something new unlocks so it's still fun. Can't wait to see what else you guys do to improve the game play since everything else has been flawless so far. Great job, keep up the great work!",
        "This game is super cute! I love my lil ninja friend! Lol. Nice story, and plenty to do to keep you busy. Will def take time to master, but it def has the potential to keep you interested in playing. Even got my wife playing it, and she usually only keeps games for a day or 2, cuz she gets bored with them. I think she'll play this one a little longer than most of the other games she's tried. I'm really happy i found this game!!",
        "This one is probably my favourite, with minecraft and clash of clans. If you don't have this Virtual Friend game, then it is you who is missing out. Install and enjoy. There's nothing bad about this game, and if Naturalmotion do want me to suggest an add-on, then maybe enable me to link the game with a new device. I was LVL 52 once but I lost it. Now I'm level 17. Hope you liked the suggestion. :)",
        "I really love this game, but if you don't put an update on Clumsy Ninja I'm going to uninstall this awesome game. In the next update will you please fix the part when you touch the story book then it tells you the pictures are still locked? If you put this in the new update anytime, I will start to love this game like I did before. One more thing.... If this helps.... I really really really love this app!!!",
        "You should add a dog and a cat wearing ninja suit they can be like the chicken and the squirrel the dog can run around you and bark and find bones and sell them for coins and the cat can find fish and sell it for coins. It just sounds like a good idea  the dog should be a husky or a smaller dog like a beagle so it is small like the other animals and it can sleep with the ninja the cat can just be a cat please look into this *^* looking forward to this"

For example \"Zero\" character to have +8 bullet pircing and +12 reload, and other characters to have +2, +6, +9, +13, +18... also for weapon is the same thing... make all caracteristics different.

        "This game is actually okay for a mobile app. The downside unfortunately - as with so many - is that there is never quite enough of anything to progress without spending a considerable amount of money. I invested a lot of time on the zombie event only to find that time was running out and I would not be able to complete it without stumping up a relative fortune. I would have bought this game but refuse to pay to play and watch a ton of advertising in the hopes of getting the gold or tickets or cash or whatever. For what you might pay for stuff like this go and buy a console game. Heck you could buy the console as well on what uou could save avoiding this. Deleting it right niw. Adios greedy developers",
        "This game is a lot of fun, really addictive and completely free to play. Of course you can buy stuff if you want, but it's not necessary.   Multiple game modes, a ton of upgrades.   This is a good one."

        "The level design is fine and the graphics is nice to look at. I like that it isn't always a course of multiple levels, but individual levels, it fits better for an on the go game. My main problem is with the controls and physics. You can hit a wall straight on and instead of bouncing back, like you would expect, it slows the ball down to a stop and just roll it a little to the side, these unpredictable physics make it hard to determine where your ball will go. And the camera controls is quite annoying, the swiping is way more intuitive and natural but is way too slow for turning 180 degrees. The button controls is too fast when trying to precision your shot.  These issues are, for me, a deal breaker and is the reason why I will not be playing this again. Though the gameplay was enjoyable when working. I have been looking for a casual golf game, and hoped this could be it, based on the more than stellar reviews.",

I think it might've been better than Rules Of Survival... this game is worth it..... it also lets you to shoot while your friends is driving a vehicle..well, only for duo or squad mode obviously....but what's more, you can actually pilot a helicopter..... nice...",
        "Great graphics with minimum config,controls are awesome  and it has dive button,can jump thru walls and climb windows,way better than the other survival games on phone,it has bullet physics! the only thing im concerned about is The lagging when shoorting from far distances,and id like to suggest a configuration for the graphics to adjust compatibilty . Thank you for this game 5stars! Your doing just great devs!",
        "I love this game and the devs reply to my requests in their official facebook page, thats awesome. One thing I wanna have here is voice chat. Definitely the best even low end devices can play this lag free. I recommend this. I don't know why they rate this so low but it's probably cuz it's not tha popular yet. Keep it up!",
        "I don't know why it got low ratings ....    I want to tell u thie guys..  ur game was absolutely great.... 125 players that impressive....graphics is good.. some minor buys ... plz reduce the sound of the heli...the most important thing is the render distance is soooooooooooo good.... i don't know how it's achived with in 180 MB .... I'm telling u this I really liked ROS....but not any more.....bc In here their is no such a lag and it can in any device... skill based  .. very good rendering distance.. the bullet drop is so realistic...jumping mechanism sooooo great and all this good things come with in 180 MB .. I love u guys.... GREAT WORK. keep it up....I really look up to the next update.......😘😘😙😙👌👌👌👌👍",
        "there are some bugs, that i knew the player is in the building and in his/her phone, but in my phone the player just float in the air its good for me to kill that player, but its not good if the player was me.  fix the building.  add or fix some features like: 1. the distance of the safezone in the mini map. 2. after automaticaly open the door, please make it close automaticaly too. 3. make the control wheel just by move the camera not by the direction arrow. 4. foot step is just too small. 5. make a gun fire radar. 6. make the animation of the character more realistic.  its ok to me if the update makes the game become 500 mb bigger than previous version.  i love this game. its run nicely in my phone.",
        "Hard to attack, easy to die. I already point the crosshair to the enemy, and when I start shooting, the crosshair miss the enemy and start to move around randomly, looks like I attack the ground, and end up died. Also, hard to find weapon and ammo. Your game is good, but not good enough. You are trying to fully copy PUBG, which is played on PC, while your game is Android-Based, hard to control. Hard to control. Easy to aim, but never hit, because the crosshair like to move around and land the bullet on the ground. Try to play Free Fire Battleground by Garena. Overall, Free Fire much better than yours. Uninstalled!"

I dont know if anyone else has experienced what my 7yr old son has but on loading the game he was shown a flashing image of a man getting stabbed in the eye. This gqme has been removed and i have reported it to the video standards board that apply ratings on these games. Not sure how these things are even possible?",
        "I would put a zero if I could. This is by far the worst LEGO game ever, and like always it's very boring and has poor graphics and gameplay. What is anything creative here? The fact that you get to choose what you build? It is so stupid on so many levels. I do not recommend this game.",

They know Legos are awesome enough that playing with some digital versions is enough to promote buying the physical bricks. ~~~~ NO ADS - Just Fun! ~~~ Even the adults like this one. It's comparable to minions paradise but with all the waiting and advertising removed.",

I can't even play with guys on my own squad now.  I used to love this game but until they fix this issue this game is weak.",

Would like to see a different method for switching guns. If i swipe on android i accidently swipe and my notification bar comes down instead. Need some better  algorithms for matches. It's tough to get into a match with some super over powered weapons...or are they modding? Would like to see an in game reporting/tagging system for obvious hackers.  There are several who frequently hack and don't get booted from the game permanently.",

Besides the gplay store download there's another almost gig download  my question is how am I supposed to straffe one finger aim with another hold device And then hit a shoot buttons without stopping to become a sitting duck ?or not aiming maybe this was made for an octopus? .",

I appreciate the fact that all the \"mandatory\" ads are instantly skippable (and thus much more manageable). The game is beatable and fun even without going through the longer \"optional\" ads (for which the rewards are fair)",
        "A unique experience indeed. A game based on wits and luck, you are given cards to face as a series of events to predict the outcome of your life. In the process you must control your government and live long enough to make a difference. I have enjoyed this game so far. nothing to fault so far.",
        "One of the very few games to end up as a shortcut on my home screen, it's adaptive - addictive, and endlessly intriguing. The Creator doesn't ask for much in return for such a well delivered game. Don't be cheap! Buy that person a cup of coffee!",
        "I think this game is really good, it was introduced to me by a friend, and I can say that I am glad I kept that friendship alive hahaha. Anyway, this game really helped me see new aspects of topics that I hadn't seen before, and it's a very interesting concept. Cheers to the developer :D.",
        "Well done, just like reign but free and in the future.  Some mechanics are the second but some are different.  There are some strange typos but nothing game breaking.  And there are some options that tell you only information but have a yes and no attached that are slightly confusing (the oil stain on the bed is an example)",
        "Not your average political decision-making game! The storyline brings a high amount of intrigue to the game, and I can positively say I'm about as addicted as I would be to a great book. I can't wait to find all the endings, highly recommended!"

        "So basically I just sat down to play stick hero. And my goal at the end of the day is to reach at least 100 cherries. Same today. But as I start playing I don't find any cherries on my path. \"That is weird!\" I say to myself. I try to double tap to get cherries it doesn't allow it. So I go to the home page to see how many cherries I have ..... the icon isn't even there???   Despite that concern, love the game its so much fun ! For u people who are looking for a fun catchy game to play here is the perfect game. Please download so much fun and a great game to put on your device!",
        "Awesome but I have some ideas This game is awesome and it never ceases to make me happy. But buying new characters is kind of pointless. Developers you probably won't see this or even care if you do but I think that when you buy new characters the characters should have abilities that you use once a round for free or you can refresh the ability using cherries.",
        "Amazing game...nice timepass.. I love this game.. It is good for kids and I enjoy playing this.. The game doesn't hang and I can't just stop my fingers writing the review.. In the first level o thought it's going to be hard but to my surprise it was easy and smooth... And I loved.. For hours I kept playing it untilthe battery was dead!! The other parts of the game are nice as well especially the voice one!!! Do download😊",
        "False Advertising I mean, in a way. The help example is slower than the actual game. The platform grows faster and the guy runs across instead of the leisurely stroll in the 'tutorial'. Maybe have an option for speed, slower or faster depending on what the player feels like tackling that day. Still a fun game, but come on. We're not all finger-ninjas.",
        "Simply but satisfying It's a very addictive game. I think the little character(s) are adorable. The only complaint I have is when you grab a cherry and then you fall because the stick isn't long enough-in my opinion you should still get the cherry put in your \"bank\". I also like the watermelon level.",
        "An advise read it plz and writ for it if u like! The game is awesome , nyc and funny and chalanging too. but i think it could b more intersesting if we get lifes in it. for example my high score is 22 and i never get on 22 again i remain on 16 or 19 but if i could hav one lyf there i shall surely reached my high score or more...\"thanku\""

THIS GAME IS NOT BASED ON SKILL, ITS BASED OFF WHO SPENT MORE MONEY. Even if you play perfect you still lose, seems legit. Was fun at first but then you realize that you're just being screwed. I'll stick with tap tap, more challenging and doesn't rely on microtransactions, this game is trash...",
        "How this is top rated I will never know. Terrible pass offs of popular songs overlayed with poorly timed notes to try and match. It sounds, looks and plays terribly. Nothing to see here. Unless these reviews were written by fake or paid accounts, the majority of players has very small knowledge of music.",
        "Once you get to a certain point, it's pay to win. They say they match you up with people that are at the same level as you, which they do, but if they have better equipment, because they paid for it, you're not winning. You both can get 100%, but they will win with better equipment. The game doesn't give you enough money for winning, to upgrade as much as you'll need to, to win.",
        "Been playing and after a few songs the app pops up wanting access to files. I said no and it tells me the game will not function without access? Funny it was running fine before. Sounds a bit dodgy. My options were allow it or quit. I quit and i am now uninstalling it.",
        "Kinda lame that all the computer opponents that you get paired with (denoted by some version of no name in the username space) seem to always score 100% note counts... Also skill band members can be way off and allow much larger gaps in total score eliminating skill from that actual round",
        "Pretty good game overall. Can be a bit glitchy at times which is annoying as it can cause you to miss a note and lose points. Also found that you can only get so far before it doesn't matter how well you do, the other player always wins. But in general is a good game and fun way to kill time."

I downloaded this for my 2 year old,  my 4 year old has tested the game out for me and is constantly hitting the ads at the bottom of the screen,  if my 4 year old does this then there is no way my 2 year old could play this without constant help with removing ads. Id happily pay to remove ads until there is an option for that im installing",

But for a smile to be beautiful, you need to take good care of your teeth. This applies to your pets, because in childhood they were for every kid. Like people, they also sometimes need to treat their teeth. This can be done by a special doctor - dentist. We present to your attention an exciting game for children - a dentist (vet clinic). In this entertaining game, your child is a real dentist, under the guidance of which there is a hospital for animals. The kid is entrusted with a very important and responsible task - the treatment of teeth of his four-footed pups, whose teeth began to ache heavily because of their love for sweets. You have to treat them in a real dental office, use various medical instruments, such as tongs, scalpels, Burmashin and many others, to clean your four-legged friends of teeth from plaque, align them, do operations, remove cavities and fill them. After all, they all just need your help. For her, the animals will be grateful to you and very grateful. Developing games for children, such as a veterinarian, contribute to the overall development of your child.

It have been updated very much which decreased the excellence of this game. At last, I want to say that if possible, please bring the old game back which can increase ratings of game and it has now a really big storage.I have played it few years ago and it was good than new one. Cant you bring old angry birds go back 😯😯😯",

        "New update well done but what about my progress in the old update? Lost it and now start from the begining and its harder for you to spend real money!!! Don't think so mateys will have few bevs instead. Rovio will s_ck a fart of my ars.....e",
        "The game is good and all. I kinda don't mind the 2.0 update that much but sometimes there are music glitches where the music stops. Also the daily races glitch when it hits 0:00:01 and it says I completed them when I didn't, so I am unable to play them. If you fix it then it might improve the game honestly."

It's realistic, but Ammo is also expensive, and I hate how You can't jack a car because if they're at a red light, and you're trying to jack their car, they may start going, or when you toss them out of the car, they annoy you and sometimes KILL you. So even if you do kill them when they're inside of it, you're doing damage to the car, not to mention you can't even Rob stores like I thought you could. But still. Awesome game!",

Although, when that happens, I get killed and spawn on top of the tower with the helicopter and when I do, the police car that I blew up is driving around, crashing into walls, blowing up and then going back! I couldn't stop laughing. So... Nothing wrong (except for the load of police after me when I blow up that car), I love it, C ya!",
        "I loved it because you can get into people's car and then get out again then kill them because they are trying to kill you so kill them. and there is a tank and a helicopter in this game and I like it so you could kill people walking and get money or there bullets and wepends. that is why I love this game."

        "Everything about this game is great, but this company/developer really differentiate themselves from the competition with their customer service and support. Any issues I've ever had with adcap or any kongregate apps were handled extremely quick with the most professions experience.   Try the game, it's addicting, challenging, and very fun. It is a freemium game but don't forget to support the devs but purchasing a gift pack or even just downloading a game you like for $1.  Thank you for the hard work guys/gals",
        "About a few years ago, I had this installed on a Droid phone. I never was able to open the app to play. Recently, I glanced through the apps I had & remembered this one. After thinking it over, I decided to get it. Now, I am happy the developers decided to upgrade the game. This is fun. I am contemplating letting the 💰 accumulate for one full day just to see how much I earn. Thank you developers for providing a fun little time waster. I recommend this if you are the type of person who 💘 s making fake money. Try it out & hopefully you enjoy it.",
        "Yes this is addictive, yes it's fun, and it's great because you can spend 12 seconds or 12 minutes on it and still get the same amount of enjoyment. BUT, and this is a very big but, this game is a HUGE drain on your battery. And no, I don't have an iPhone - I have a proper phone - a Sony XZ Pro. So it's not the weedy battery. No game I have ever played drains the battery away as fast as this game does, so it's clearly an issue that I wish they could fix.",
        "Was having fun until the game decided to take about 30 of these megabucks from me for no apparent reason. Took me a while to get them considering how far I am. Not sure if I want to play anymore knowing this could happen again. Other than that it's pretty good.",
        "Way way WAYYY too laggy. It's an easy casual game though. I wouldn't say it's \"fun\" but it does pass the time and make you want to achieve the little goals. Only goal, make more money in game. That's it and you achieve that by not even playing the game so there's no challenge whatsoever. Uninstalled after first day reaching about 500 Trillion and force closing 100 times.",
        "It clicks on adds with out me hitting it at all. Then when I get back to the app it forgets that I watched the add at all even tho I watched all the way through. It happens repeatedly. It only forgets half the time but it almost always clicks on the adds. Other than that it's a good time killer with easy ways to get through it quickly as long as you watch some adds."

It's realistic, but Ammo is also expensive, and I hate how You can't jack a car because if they're at a red light, and you're trying to jack their car, they may start going, or when you toss them out of the car, they annoy you and sometimes KILL you. So even if you do kill them when they're inside of it, you're doing damage to the car, not to mention you can't even Rob stores like I thought you could. But still. Awesome game!",
        "I hate this stupid game I have just played this game and you know what happend it crashed everybody do not play this one game and the second one of this it is a stupid game i never even got to play it and i still think it is stupid sorry for the words just fix it plz JJJJJUUUUUSSSSSSTTTTTT fiiiiixxxxxx ittttttt if i could put no stars i willllll",
        "I love it! Except, when I blow up a police car while it's parked, it respawns and about 18 police cars are after me! Although, when that happens, I get killed and spawn on top of the tower with the helicopter and when I do, the police car that I blew up is driving around, crashing into walls, blowing up and then going back! I couldn't stop laughing. So... Nothing wrong (except for the load of police after me when I blow up that car), I love it, C ya!",
        "I loved it because you can get into people's car and then get out again then kill them because they are trying to kill you so kill them. and there is a tank and a helicopter in this game and I like it so you could kill people walking and get money or there bullets and wepends. that is why I love this game."

This game has some potential but it's getting wasted here.",

I really do like this game but like I said I might not have it that long because there is not much to do on it I need the premium stuff! Thank you for the hard work on this game but it is not enough to satisfy me fully, anyway let me know what's up!...",

        "I love this game. Its and absolute tome waster and lovely to play. However, I had set my phone to the side to let it play out (as I was over 1400) and it reset on its own. I had cleared the screen the round previously so there was no chance of me losing to that. It was behind me and I never would have reset it. Is this some sort of glitch? If it is, please fix it soon. Aside from this, this is amazing.",
        "I beat my high score, & watched the ad to get a second turn.  Great right?  Apparently not.  I always try to press the back button to get out of ads once they are over, but that didn't work.  So I pressed the 'X' in the top right corner & boom... The #&$@&#@ Play Store opens... So I went to close it... & The Play Store replaced the game!!!! So when I closed it, I closed the game... So yeah I'm pretty triggered.  I PRESSED THE 'X'!  The game itself is awesome. But now I'm triggered.  Please fix that.",
        "If I could give zero (0) stars for controls, that would be too high. The game is fun and addictive. But there is a restart button that there is NO REASON FOR. I have lost my progress three times with scores over 1000, which takes weeks to achieve. THE DEVELOPER DOES NOT RESPOND EVER. Uninstalling.",
        "It's good at first but you'll lose returning customers. Where are the power ups? Maybe an ultra bull that acts as 2 hits each turn. Nothing is drawing me back to and having me for higher school. In fact high score just means waiting longer. Could potentially be a great game.",
        "Best ever! Addicted to it. Cute graphics and fun color make it great! The aim-and-fire technique makes it original! Installed it 2 days ago, top score 72 average score 50!  P.S. If you like this app (which you probably do) try Amazing Thief! Great and another Ketchapp marvel! I'm not spoiling it, but I will tell you it's a lot like Flappy Bird. If you don't know what Flappy Bird is, well then look it up.  P.P.S.  Anyone here would probably have at least SEEN Flappy Bird, but seriously. It is like an Aztec-age game.",
        "Both my husband and I have this game.  I opted to pay for the no ads though, he did not.  DO NOT do this!  He is able to get \"continues\" for watching adds and can keep climbing up the levels.  I cannot since I purchased no adds.  I get to continue once and that's all since I have stopped ads from allowing me to get the extra chances.  I wish I would have known this beforehand. Otherwise, this game is seriously fun and addicting."

        "All of this is absolutely amazing. I have social anxiety, and the first time I played this (which was minutes ago) helped me so much. I could simply get lost in my own little world- or should I say oasis- for a while so I can calm down. Also the little messages are very sweet, and I love the artstyle! All in all this is a fantastic game, I wholeheartedly love it. C:",
        "I like it a lot but I only wish I could turn off the SFX for tapping and leave the BGM and ambient noises (like rain from the weather and rain cloud) on. Other than that, the ads are subtle and unobtrusive, the bonuses reasonably helpful for the cost, and the shop is nice (but unnecessary! You can enjoy the game without it. )",
        "Ads, ads and more ads. Rated family friendly but ads include electric cigarettes and lottery. Not exactly family friendly. The game is based on tapping to gain hearts to buy things to gain more hearts. Neat except it's nearly impossible to avoid the ads, which seem to be nothing but electric cigarettes and lottery ads (more than 6/10). Even when you're trying to play without ads, you will inevitably tap one of those inspirational messages from one of the animals or plants and launch an ad.",
        "I really love the inspirational phrases that pop up randomly. It really changes my mood when I read one. The only thing is that I wish this could have a journal section. Where I could write thoughts down or a gratitude journal where you write 3 good things that happen today and you could double your hearts. It would help level up the land faster and for people that are using this as a pick me up app. It would help us put our thoughts down all in the same place. :)",
        "I've only been playing this game for about 30 minutes and I can already say this game is one I'll be playing for a long while. I have a job interview coming up and boy does this relieve my anxiety! The little bubbles of encouragement is a very nice touch! They make me feel warm and fuzzy.",
        "The Ad. we're too long to enjoy the game! Sometimes it shows that I should rotate the screen to display Ad. but I have rotated the screen and cannot resolve the situation. All I can do was press the home button ànd kill the process fróm recent APP list then relaunch the APP."

And addictive including this one it's fun and ever since the first play I've been hooked there are barely any adds and the graphics are phenomenal. I play it all the time plz don't change this, if u do your going to loose my five stars🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟.",
        "Most of my apps are from Ketchapp. Their creativity and style of games have just been wanting me to download more and more! Right now, Ketchapp is one of my most favourite game groups ever! Keep making more! I don't have any improvements, which means that their games are top notch!",
        "Patheitc. Being such a fast paced game you cannot have the blocks starting to move a split second before you're going to pass it. Makes the game pretty impossible from the first level. For something that was supposed to be fun, is more frustrating. You need severe luck on your side to get a win. Recommended do not download",
        "Its a good concept, but you need to update it, and make sure the blocks no longer move. Right now, it is by far the most luck based skill game. It is impossible to dodge the moving blocks, so if they are to move, they should move much slower",
        "Good, but difficulty is a bit tough. Unless I was a Jedi, it feels like I'm starting on what should be a hard level. The AI is way too slow as well. I wish you could could change the color of your ball and race online with others in real time.",
        "THIS GAME IS RIGGED FOR YOU TO WIN. All you have to do is not die. I literally just played a game without rolling over any boosts and still won. The bots are programmed to let you win and just die before the end. This makes the game too easy and not fun to play."

        "I wrote a review already for my game on my laptop,and as I said I love this game but for some addicting reason I now have a new game on my new tablet I just got hehe. I am not here to complain and I'm not saying anyone else is in just wanted to let you know that some of the ads don't show up on the tablets you can hear them play but can't see them and as I said (some). I have managed my way around it through memorizing where the close (x) is just from trying to tap every corner but I would like not to have to do that hehe. But like I said I can manage, it's just that I know someone who would like to play but can't really stand that lol my mom hehe anyway I just thought about it would be nice if she could play too and it might help as well. Thanks for reading and listening and have yourselves  a nice day and night. Plus thanks for this game!",
        "I love this game! So much,very addictive and very unique!  I would rate 100 stars if I could!You can battle, feed dragons, do clans...ECT ! Every update it gets new things!  Best dragon game ever!You would love this game, just get it! And it's free!There are so many islands too! You can connect it on Google play to save the game or Facebook! The dragons are so cute!!! Please get this game! There are so many activities  And tournaments!",
        "I love this game so much but... I used to play this game a year ago then I got tired of it then I returned yesterday  I had a Facebook account that even has a legendary called Ice cream , so I signed in back half of my dragons are gone , my farms , my island everything that's why I rated 1 if I could get my account back I would rate 5 Thanks. Sincerely,  A Google Player ( Facebook too ).",
        "I love this game because is it active! I can play it all day and not get board! Keep up the great work everyone!😛😛 ( there a lot of ads every 5 minutes though. I don't know why. Pls fix that and the game will be even better! Respond to me as soon as you can! Thanks you for your time to listen to my opinion!",
        "There is an unnecessary amount of ads. I understand representing your sponsors, but at what cost to your customers? General game play is also very challenging for new players  as far as leveling up dragons, collecting coins/food, and even breeding times are ridiculous.",
        "Not for those who want a almost free game.  Of course the developers need to make money, but I think this game goes overboard.  In order to advance in the game at a rate that keeps you interested, you must pay.  Not very balanced."

        "Well after playing all the battleships games on Google play store I must to say that his one is the best of all. The game have the best graphics, the best gameplay and one of the most important things in my opinion there is a lot more ships and different types of ships than the other games. So if you enjoy playing games about battleships I recommend you to play this one instead of the others. The only negative thing that I found is the lack of ships in some countries except for Japan and USA, it would be great if they add all ships that are present in the PC version.",
        "Excellent Game overall. Good graphics and controls (once you get used to how a ship moves) feels very real. Gameplay is fair but challenging and is addictive when trying to LVL up. Costs are reasonable but bonus cold be higher for premium account when compared to console prices. Customer service very good. I had a loading issue and advice was prompt and issue is resolved. Would edge about 4.7 out of 5 for me.",
        "Fun game at first and got all the way to a tier V battleship!! It was fun until I started going against OP destroyers. I can broadside that tiny ship two of three times but it doesn't matter. Couple of torps and down I go. They move faster than i can track. Will be going back to Battle of Warships.",
        "The game in general is great but torpedoes are just too powerful. I can't even hit the destroyers with their speed but now with their infinite torpedo supply that always seems to reload faster than my guns I can't even stand a chance? No fun at all. If anything you should follow battlestations Midway and Pacific. They're models completely balanced everything. Torpedoes were powerful there but they took awhile to reload and were finite. Thus you couldn't just spam. If you missed you lost out and had to do it the old fashioned way. Either nerf torpedoes or buff BBs cause otherwise it just isn't fair.",
        "Very well executed port of a good game. Mostly sane monetization. The only problem I see is the premium price. In desktop version it is slightly less than 10$/month which is on the cheap side for MMO and makes a very good proposition. Mobile version is almost 30$/month which is frankly too much. I may consider 10$, or even 15$ per month (same as AAA MMO games on desktop with a ton more content), but not twice the price, especially for a mobile time killer.",
        "Good Naval Battle game.  Graphic is good. Aiming seem realistic. Team oriented.  Still need some adjustments( such as full salvo Battleship rounds hits can't even cripple a DD).  Missing some mechanism like ammo rack damage. But over all, it is a good game although not as balanced as PC version."

Additionally, the purchase is supposed to remove ads yet once you exit a level an ad pops up again.",

Then closing this reloads the my little pony game from the beginning so you lose all progress anyway. Totally unplayable and not acceptable to give to children, Budge should be asahmed of themselves!

        "This game would be a lot better if it showed how to win and gave an as you go tutorial. As it is it's just guessing and a shot in the dark. It literally took me half an hour plus 3 hints to get 3stars on a level.",
        "Gameplay was very good, if not ridiculous in rewarding you for cheaply built yet unstable structures....but whatever, that's a game mechanic that can be overlooked. What really turns me off to this game though are the push notifications. For one, why does a game like this even NEED push notifications. Secondly, to then make me unable to disable said feature is ridiculous. So 1 star out of sheer prinicple",
        "I remember playing an older version of this game called \"Bridge Constructor\" & I'm afraid this new version makes me feel nostalgic for the old one. The scoring system is purely financial (it used to consider how stable the bridge was as well). The game seems to want to get you to build the bridge how it wants you to build it. Creativity is discouraged.",
        "This really gets your brain working to solve these challenges. It could only get better with a sand box mode, but having the constraints of each scenario keeps you on your toes.",
        "Actually forces the player to engage some brain cells and memory banks. The practicle application of physics is a must with this game and you are essentially in awe of good ole Roman engineering.   As an educational application, this presents an excellent opportunity for individuals to learn the basics of civil engineering.  I sincerely applaud the developers.",
        "A good time waster.  Some control issues and limitations on building process which are not in similar games ... however a good concept for a puzzle/engineering game."

    "description" : "Put your engineering skills, intuition and smarts to test in this brand new Bridge Construction Simulator puzzle game. You will become a constructor who is required to improvise and – most of all – adapt to the task at hand. Use your resources to construct structures able to hold the weight of a car. Try to become a good builder as fast as you can - things will get hard. You won't be racing against the time, so be a careful and thoughtful constructor.You will design and construct increasingly elaborate bridges across four varied locations. Each one is a different logic puzzle for a thoughtful builder. Things may seem easy when you start out in a city, but once you move to the canyon, valley and finally mountains it will get hard. The task is never impossible, but the size and resilience of your structures will have to increase substantially if you don't want to be responsible for a car crash. Use your logic and skill to become a master bridge builder and break some records along the way!In addition to the normal mode Bridge Construction Simulator offers an easy (for an increased budget and more flexibility) or hard one (for an ultimate, seemingly impossible puzzle challenge that will be able to break even the best builder). There is something for a constructor of every skill level. If you find yourself in a tight spot, a hint system will help guide you to the solution and help you build your skill as a builder. Use the help provided to construct bridges that will not break.The game is a simulator that makes extensive use of realistic physics. As the car drives through the construction you've built you will see it stretch and bend. That way even if you fail you can see the weak points of your construction and use your logic to improve it. Build with your brain and you will be good.Realistic and detailed graphics make every level of Bridge Construction Simulator come to life and even offer a slight consolation when you fail as a constructor. Because when your bridge collapses and the car falls down, you can at least expect a spectacular crash! Just enjoy it and don't let it break you - muster your skill and try again! Nothing is ever impossible for an ambitious constructor. Play and become a legendary bridge builder!Game features:- Superb physics - a true simulator - Multiple addictive levels across four different worlds- State of the art realistic graphics- Fantastic, varied and detailed environments - you won't get bored as you build - Spectacular special effects- Mind bending, challenging puzzles requiring the use of thought and logic - Varying skill levels for increased challenge or more relaxed gameplay - something for every constructor - Built-in hint system helps you build your skill",

        "Fun game until you get to a level where you have to pay to move on. Minimum diamonds needed to delete tough lines is 200 And you can only earn diamonds 5 or 10 at a time. Need to be able to earn diamonds faster.  Even if you purchase diamonds the pricing is exorbitant.  Way out of line with other games. Update: don't waste your money to update to a better ball. It does no good and actually makes the game harder.",
        "I wish I could say this was a great game, I love brick games like this one but unfortunately this one is still buggy. For some reason everytime I try and Shoot To the Left it releases before I take my thumb off and completely screws up my shot. Does not seem to happen as much when shooting to the right side of the screen. Especially annoying when I have one block left in the warning Zone. The aiming is also an issue. Fix these issues and I will absolutely love this game.",
        "Simple. Fun. No intrusive, annoying ads that force you out of the gameplay, jyst a simple bar at tge top I was actually inckibed to look at because I FELT like giving sonething back because I was enjiying the game. All games shoikd be like this. Try firce ads diwn our thrists, we will uninstall and play sonething else. Which is how I found this gem. Well done people, excellent spin on block breaker.",
        "Game was fine until level 319. It stopped being fun after that. I took over a month of building up power ups before beating it. Only to find out 320 was almost the same design. Started fun... ended tragically.   Uninstalled."

        "Absolutely love this game. The graphics are gorgeous and the beautiful colors are the main attraction. The gameplay is smooth and the system is easy to understand. Only hindrance would be to those that want to sit down and chug through the game. Simply put, you can't, unless you but in game credits. You'll generally be limited to a few puzzles a day or a good puzzle here and there to eat up the occasional time. It's a calm inducing, fun puzzle game with filled with gorgeous hues through and through",
        "I really enjoy the game, but the monetization method behind it sucks the fun out of it: unless you continuously spend money on in-game credits, you are limited to a few puzzles per day. I would gladly buy this game for, say, $5 if it meant I could play however many levels I wanted, whenever I wanted. Otherwise, a great game, very relaxing and therapeutic. Until the monetization method changes: 3 stars rather than 5.",
        "Edit: changed my rating as I've watched the same ad twice now and it won't update my prisms. Can't be the internet connection as the whole ad shows without interruption! Really enjoy the game and the colours and graffixs are great but the ads after every game are super annoying! If I want more credits I'll watch an ad or at most every 3 games to keep the app free.",
        "I absolutely love this game. Completed all the levels for a few months now and am eagerly awaiting new puzzles! It really allows me to relax but challenge my mind at the same time. :D This game is one of the best colour puzzle games so far when compared to other games such as Blendoku and Color Puzzle. The only thing missing is really just not having enough levels to play.",
        "As many have said this game is relaxing, challenging without being frustrating and its graduated colors are very appeasing to the eye. I do wish I could save the 'puzzle' after its complete without having a heart in it. And even though I mainly play as a relaxing passtime the competitor in me wishes for some stats that rank my ability a little more indepth then 'you did better then the world average' ...  All in all this is well worth the download. Thank you Zut!",
        "I love hue is a simple puzzle game that is relaxing and entertaining. Good for helping me to wind down and chill out. As much as people complain about in game currency, the game is free and i cant fault the method of watching a 30 second ad to be able to play 4 more levels of the game. The developers have to make their money one way or another and its not like the game pops up with ads after every level or bombards you with content you absolutely have to pay for. I think this is probably one of the best puzzle game apps on the play store. 5/5 stars for sure"

        "Lost another These constant updates caused me to uninstall this. Fun game - very good game!But if it ain't broke don't fix it. I will not sacrifice all the other good games I have for this single one. Now with google only allowing so many apps ( no writing to sd card). Atleast if you update you should let people keep playing with version they have. Make updates optional.",
        "I am not able to play with my friends in custom mode. We are a group of 11 & we want to play together in custom mode by creating our own room. But My 4 friends have IOS devices & their Servers are showing different than us. I don't know why? We can't even connect by number also. Tried doing that!. Please let me know its fixture",
        "It's a fun game. If you're a COD player you'll love it. In general It does good on it's own as a solid shooter. Only thing I think you really, REALLY need to change is the way to get weapons. Using rentals is great, picking up enemy or ally weapons, sure, but having to spend money to get most weapons, if not all, seems a little unfair. It's good that there's a grind to get them but I think it's a little overkill how difficult it is. I think levels should determine what you unlock, then use silver (make it easier to get) to purchase it. Or, if players want to speed up the process, use gold.",
        "I really like the game. Fun, exciting, and addictive. The only problem I have is that the rewards you get are not nearly enough as I think they should be. Exp gains are good, but cash gains are so bad and you will have to play for hours to accumulate cash and then you can buy HALF of a weapon, because they require a lot of cash to get one. You also can barely upgrade weapons without any gold and you can just forget about that unless you put some real world currency in this game, which is a real shame. As a player I know we would like to buy and upgrade our own weapons instead of having to \"rent\" which is an option in the game.",
        "this game is great, but i rated 3 star cuz i wanted this gaem to be like COD: WWII, and like ravenfield. There are NO MG nests, no war modes like COD:WWII, and please, fix the prices! It took me 3 years of full gameplay, 5 hours just to get a shotgun. And please optimize the guns. Overall, really great game!                                  By a youtuber                            Zombiehunter78oo  P.S. Please add more guns and some more features.",
        "One of the dumbest cod ripoff i have seen and played in 2k18 so far. You need 20 bullets to kill someone with head shot. Dont waste your time with this dumb game. Play something else and yea a FREAKING TANK IN A MAP THIS SMALL. like were you under the influence of some substances when you made this game. Wast of time. Dont download this abomination."

Which I did, even though that's when MORE DATA USAGE. Now it won't even load past a certain percentage, haven't gotten to play yet, even after DIDN'T TONS if files and data worth of the game.........Pls fix so I can actually try the game. I WILL EDIT THE REVIEW IF I GET TO PLAY",
        "Fantastic game! It's by Gameloft so it's bound to be a good phone game. It's not unfair, but you do have to have some skill. It doesn't hold your hand but it's not hard to learn the controls. Despite the fact that you're also playing against people who are on their computers as well, it's definitely not unfair. One request: maybe add more options for your killstreaks. I would love to have my drone and turret on the same killstreak for my sniper class but I'm stuck with recon instead. Still love it tho :)",
        "After the latest update the multiplayer rating is bugged and doesn't increase. Also provide some leverage to get the prestige guns because i can hardly afford it. The weapons box also provide useless blueprints of the guns which turns into diamonds and i end up having lots of diamonds and very less credits which doesnt help getting a high end gun.",

Please fix those problems",
