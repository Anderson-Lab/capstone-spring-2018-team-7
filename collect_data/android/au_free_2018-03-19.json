        "I love many aspects of the game, but there are some seriously frustrating issues. After accidentally clicking through the out of food warnings twice I think I'm done playing. It is silly to invest an hour into exploring only to lose it all because of an extra click, especially when you have a bunch of telaports. When player runs out of food, options should be camp, teleport, or suicide...and suicide should NOT be clicking anywhere on the screen. Provide a button.",

        "It's great fun!! My only problem is when I watch first position in events those fast bikes look really fake. I hope it's just how it looks and it's not the actual game physics when I unlock those bikes. My biggest problem is tournaments. They have different categories for entry cost but the high speed players can still enter and win any tier tournament below Thier skill level. They should not be allowed to dominate lower tier players",
        "If there is anything that would make me quit playing this game, it would be ads. I don't mind ads but ads are just way too much and take away the fun of this game.  Apart from that game also freezes sometimes and there are some glitches too.",
        "Great game. Only criticism is, when your racing with other players where there are lifts etc. They can bypass the lift and go over water like it's just not there. And like others have said during tournaments the leader is like 10 seconds faster and supposedly on the same bike. There must be hackers there is no way at all the bikes fly or hover. Come on guys get a grip on this so it's fair for everyone",
        "I liked the older versions of this game, but this one is horrible. There's ads constantly, any time you resume playing from the screen going to sleep, or if you wreck there's one right across the middle of the screen!  Every time it connects to the server, it takes whole minutes to load. Sometimes I set my phone down, the screen goes to sleep and then i have to watch another ad! If I was waiting for it to load an ad in the first place, I have to watch that one first, then a second one as punishment for the screen time out. 😒😒 Not cool Loading times plus ad videos constantly, equates to more than time spent playing. It's miserable. LG V20 on Tmo and 100Mbps wifi",
        "Bit hard to get used to at first. But when the bikes been upgraded and Machu Pichu opened game gets much more enjoyable and less frustrating. Smoth graphics with good gameplay. Any purchase gets rid of ads but at nearly £5 for cheapest purchase it's a bit steep (and you get very little for your £5). But, all in all, a very good game that's worth sticking with.",
        "Cherishable app! I love it, just some minor problems: - Has plenty ads and never skip once when quite competition.  - Its controls should be customizable.  - Partners' profiles should be viewable.      Thank you for your help!"

        "Absolutely love this game. The graphics are gorgeous and the beautiful colors are the main attraction. The gameplay is smooth and the system is easy to understand. Only hindrance would be to those that want to sit down and chug through the game. Simply put, you can't, unless you but in game credits. You'll generally be limited to a few puzzles a day or a good puzzle here and there to eat up the occasional time. It's a calm inducing, fun puzzle game with filled with gorgeous hues through and through",
        "I really enjoy the game, but the monetization method behind it sucks the fun out of it: unless you continuously spend money on in-game credits, you are limited to a few puzzles per day. I would gladly buy this game for, say, $5 if it meant I could play however many levels I wanted, whenever I wanted. Otherwise, a great game, very relaxing and therapeutic. Until the monetization method changes: 3 stars rather than 5.",
        "Edit: changed my rating as I've watched the same ad twice now and it won't update my prisms. Can't be the internet connection as the whole ad shows without interruption! Really enjoy the game and the colours and graffixs are great but the ads after every game are super annoying! If I want more credits I'll watch an ad or at most every 3 games to keep the app free.",
        "I absolutely love this game. Completed all the levels for a few months now and am eagerly awaiting new puzzles! It really allows me to relax but challenge my mind at the same time. :D This game is one of the best colour puzzle games so far when compared to other games such as Blendoku and Color Puzzle. The only thing missing is really just not having enough levels to play.",
        "As many have said this game is relaxing, challenging without being frustrating and its graduated colors are very appeasing to the eye. I do wish I could save the 'puzzle' after its complete without having a heart in it. And even though I mainly play as a relaxing passtime the competitor in me wishes for some stats that rank my ability a little more indepth then 'you did better then the world average' ...  All in all this is well worth the download. Thank you Zut!",
        "I love hue is a simple puzzle game that is relaxing and entertaining. Good for helping me to wind down and chill out. As much as people complain about in game currency, the game is free and i cant fault the method of watching a 30 second ad to be able to play 4 more levels of the game. The developers have to make their money one way or another and its not like the game pops up with ads after every level or bombards you with content you absolutely have to pay for. I think this is probably one of the best puzzle game apps on the play store. 5/5 stars for sure"

It is confusing if you pick paint or something it just goes back to the original colour. I didn't like how easy the drawings were and I don't think the glow art works. It just comes out as crayon. I wouldn't recommend this game if you don't like colouring. It's ok!!!!",
        "I think there should be more cartoons to draw and color. And it should not always be right colors to trace it in. Also i think that one small part of the picture shouldn't color the whole background, because what if you didn't want them bother the same exact color, because no affence, but it looks weird and ugly sometimes. Sorry for no compliments.                    LOVE, YOUR DEAR FRIEND!!!",

        "This game is really fun!! One bug I have found though is when you reset you're ascended points it gives you 20000 back no matter how many ascended points you have. For example I had 2 ascended points put them into damage reset it and got 20000 back. Gotta fix that. Over all it's a really fun game",
        "So far it's a very fun game. The music reminds me of old rpgs, and the random loot reminds me of Diablo. I'm about an hour into grinding and have only been forced to watch one 30 second ad but you have the option to watch a few more for items or perks. No bugs seen yet. I got a little happier when I left the game on and my lil hero's went into the dungeon without me.",
        "Can be very fun but is confusing at some points. For example, while attempting to ascend, you must lose the battle. Capturing beasts is also confusing and im still not sure what they are even used for. Otherwise, great game!",
        "This game gets very complicated very quickly. The game's mechanics of clicking on your character to heal them doesn't work often because the characters move quickly.  If you lock a specific item it still allows you to sell it with no notice. Overall a decent game that has too much to offer up too early.",
        "Auto play ads, and loading message on the screen at all times.  Power ups for sale at all timed.  These are the features that turned me completely away.  You should stay away too.",
        "They say it is fun playing this game, bit to me it's not. Why? The words are so very tiny cant read message written in it. If you let the letters enlarge it i'll give you 5 stars"

Some of these shots are really difficult, if you don't get the right basket first. Anyway, I love the challenge. Y'all got my vote. BEST GAME EVER. Thanks man. I love your guys' creativity.",
        "This game was good  but could be better. I wish there was something other than just basketball. Like tennis, football, or something like that. Graphics were good. This game is addicting but it's hard to get past level 20 if you don't have Facebook. So I'm stuck on trying to get enough stars to get through. Good but could be better",
        "Had to lower my stars. You have to use all the retry and balls a couple times just to figure out levels. Then u play 1 level and u wait for more energy. Same ole money app pay to play. Was ok until higher levels. Now it drives me crazy. Good game though just can't play it much.",
        "This game is fun, but it seems like there are tons of attempts to get you to buy stuff. Plus you can't get Panda as a character. But other than that this game is awesome. I don't know why on the Dude Perfect channel they advertise it as just for iPhone, but at the very end say it is also available for Android. I recommend this game. It is very fun",
        "Firstly to John J - I have never paid a cent to play this game and that is why I love this game!! I have been able to complete the whole game 210 levels without paying a dime! That's truly awesome! It has been challenging because in order to advance I needed to get 3 stars on all levels to open up the next level for free. Then of course you have the energy bar that runs out, but that's ok because it replenishes in reasonable time. I would run out and instead of paying money I would go check an email, or post on Facebook and before too long I'm back playing a few more shots on dude perfect 2!! So easy, so cheap, so challenging and so much fun and so friggin awesome when you completed level in 3 stars!! I can't wait till the next section opens to see what they have in store for us. Thanks.",
        "Would be better if you could do everything without Facebook cos that sorta limits options for some people. Also could you please get rid of the energy bar? That makes things hard. But like that you put your actual voice in it."

But if I do a normal collect it gets pressed once and it's done. And whoever created the idea of offering the \"free\" first reward and then watch a video for all after is a complete moron. i have a Samsung and after every race I have to watch a video in order to collect my prize while I look over at my friend who has a POS iPhone and he gets to collect his prize with no video. It even says \"first prize free\" and yet I have to watch a video. Are you really that incompetent.? Get real.",

I always make sure I download game whenever I upgrade to a new phone...it doesn't bother me to start all over bcuz I could play this game from beginning to end everyday!!

But since my tv can't download apps so I opened d website on d browser on d tv but the room no or the QR code doesn't appear no matter how long I wait. I don't know what d problem is please tell me a solution",
        "It would be a really good game if it stops letting me use my coins then when I'm in the game for not even 5 seconds. It would shut down on me and when I login back in my coins are gone. I will like you to fix that",
        "Yeah. This game it is very cool and all but, there's this really messed up update and I kinda... Hate it. I only have 200 coins daily, thus it isn't for buying songs, it's for just playing them. This update is a money-baiter. I got to say, this game really took a lot of work to Ubisoft and who am I to critize it. But I think that they should let us buy the songs. This game is really cool btw",
        "Its good but the update mess me up because i have so many song that ived by but now i dont have any of it and there s a limit by purchasing a song 2 songs per day? And what happen to the connecting with fb? What the heck",
        "The new update STILL didn't fix the coin limit. And when I tried to buy something with my coins that I didn't have enough coin for it. I lost all my money and it told me I didn't have enough money to buy it! But it's still a good game. Also please put love ward in the game thanks",
        "Rubbish update. Takes my coins but  phone gets stuck on loading screen, even though the tablet starts the dance."

        "Really great gamplay, graphics, amazing controls which mind you are much more responsive than Sonic Dash or at least I think so, and this is the best concept I've ever seen. It's like Sonic Dash and a racing Sonic game had a baby. Best of all, this game captures the essence of Sonic in a brilliant way. Another thing I'd like to say is it's super balanced(besides Cream shes cheap as hell) but the fact is no character is better than the other cause they all have something unique about themselves.",
        "The game is super choppy! I dont have a bad phone or Wi-Fi so I dont know the problem. If there was a mode like where you can reduce graphics that would be amazing. Besides that the rest is fine. Getting characters is easy, ads plays when after a match and/or if you want to double your rewards, and looks pretty nice.",
        "I like it, really cool game, you never really know what's going to happen in a race. If you guys are making yet another character to race with, Im asking: can it please be Infinite, Big the 🐱, or our own custom character? Also, are you able to make different racing music in the game? I have a feeling that some people will get annoyed if the same \"Lost Valley\" song is being played over and over again.",
        "I was enjoying the game but I started getting put against level 8's and 9's as a level 2.  Losing two races would take away 6 or 7  second place wins in a row, worth of progress.  I would lose 15-20 minutes worth of progress in two races. Wasting my time and effort.  Sometimes I swipe up to jump and my character just spin dashes instead, so my character just slams into an object or spins into a hole. Annoying.  After trying again and losing all gains in two losses, uninstalled.  Waste of time.",
        "This game is really great and well polished. However, something needs to be done about the players with laggy connections. Most of the players with over 2000 points are all so laggy, that you can't tell where they are so you can't attack them. They are abusing the lag and need to be dealt with somehow.",
        "Like the game but the latest update have mess up the gameplay with alot of lag. It keep sticking or kicking me out of the gameplay. Before the uodate. I had no issues and it was great. Please look into this"

        "Repetitive game that requires a lot of thinking. Quite addictive as I've been playing for nearly year and half now. I didn't spend a penny on game but quite a lot of time. Its very difficult to be very good without spending real cash but it's possible. You can watch adverts for coins, so be patient and play. The more you play the more you get. You don't need top characters to have great team - you can create great team with average characters if you focus on weapons. Get yourself into a good team, hit faction's minimums and you'll become great.",
        "There are good and bad aspects of this game, but the pros out weigh the cons. You can absolutely level up incredibly high without spending a single penny on this game. You just need patience. One of the funniest aspects of this game is its long term playability. There is always something to do every day and in the long run it all adds up to your benefit.  My only complaint is the pop up windows when you first get on. They show you you've been raided...then you have the notification that you have to check that gives you the same info. If the pop up already gives me the info, why do I still have notifications?",
        "Rubbish repetitive game. After spending ten's of thousands pointlessly I can tell you honestly... don't waste your time or money. It's a very addictive cash cow and just a very smart way to take your money and keep you hooked. Scopely has repeatedly lied and will continue to do so. You have been warned",
        "Ive been playing this for 2 years, love it but support is well below standard. I have a problem just now where it crashes every 5 mins and support do nothing. Its become unplayable. Avoid if you have a samsung device",
        "The game has slowly been turning more p2w than ever before. Before 6 stars had come into play, you could easily get any 5 stars. Even some p2w toons were able to be accessed later on in some events. With 6 stars, this really isn't the case. This has also caused the Road to Survival community to become more toxic and started making the game unfair/not fun for other players.",
        "I like the strategy involved in playing the game. The only thing I think I would change is when you kill an enemy and he comes back to life,  they should come back as a zombie. .not keep all their ability before death. .otherwise it keeps you interested."

        "I love it! Out of all the 4 versions my favorite is this one. And it does say 12+ but it really isn't that bad once you get use to it. I just learned to play these games a month ago and trust me you see a pattern of where they go. I haven't played it one night. But then again I have never been jump scared. And parents if your kid is 9 or 10 and they want this game I say go ahead and say yes! One of the best games ever!",
        "It would be better if.... If you would be able to play MORE THAT ONE NIGHT. And when I used the flashlight I had to tap on the area a good few times before it actually worked. And no I don't have a problem with my screen.  I love the PC version of both the games, one of the best horror games in years. I'll definitely buy it IF reaction time on the flashlight would improve. I love the storyline and graphics of the game and would recommend it to anyone who is willing to work on night shift at Freddy Fazbear pizzeria.",
        "AWESOME I am in love with the 2nd game! It's scary and addicting because you want to come back for more! Fnaf is my fav game in the world and I make awesome fan art for it. (Instagram: Laughingsealey) I am saving up for the mobile versions of fnaf even tho I have all the PC versions. I love the graphics and the lore in this game! Actually, this is the only horror game I will play. I spend hours coming up with theory's and watching theorists make more theory's. Amazing game and it's worth the money!",
        "Great! Even though this is only the demo, it is amazing. Just playing the demo made me nervous, but despite that I am purchasing the full game. (Luckily) I was able to complete the demo when I played it, so I am a valid advice giver to anyone who tries the demo. My advice: Get the demo. It is great. Another piece of advice is don't waste your battery. I was able to complete the demo with three bars of my battery left. The last piece of advice I'll give is to keep an eye on Bonnie.",
        "Force Close I LOVE THIS GAME MORE THAN ANY LIVING SOUL!! And then it doesn't work!? It's an awesome game and I would never hate, but is there any way that you can fix this? And I was also wondering if u can make the demo free for the first game out as well. Thanks Scott :)",
        "This game is scary for me because purple man jumpscares me a lot and am 9 years old. Scott thanks for making it but I will gave it 5 stars if you put a warning sign that says that there coming. Also if you could make the flashlight with more power and make it go to other nights and hard. But this game is scary and cool"

        "Great concept, design and execution. The game is simple to play but extremely hard to master, along the lines of Flappy Bird, and more closely, QWOP. The design language is innovative and intentionally sketch-like, but the physics of leg motion are hilariously realistic. There's no elaborate story (which makes this great for casual gameplay) but the motions, expressions, costumes and messages provide a compelling setting and get us to get quite fond of the clumsy main character.",

        "This is the best of its kind for mobile, and one of the best overall. The graphics and UI are nice and stylish, the controls are great, the gameplay is solid and it's generally just very fun to play. However, the game has some optimization issues. When you minimize it, it disconnects, and if you wait long enough it shuts down the entire game. I get that it was made like this to reduce background data, but come on, not everybody stays in the game all the time. It also takes longer than most games to connect. These are minor issues, but it would be great to see them fixed.",
        "This game works good but the reason I gave it 2 stars is whenever I click on ranked games it shows leaver penalty and the time to wait is shown 00:00:00:00. After waiting for so many days,it is always showing like this and not allowing me to play ranked games.Hope you would look into this.",
        "developer, i used to keep on playing cuz its very very fun but idk why recently when i click on connect via google play it shows connecting after that nth changes. i DONT want the ops acc i WANT my usual account back. the name of my usual account is   -FiReRY-  and the clan name is DeNY. pls pls pls pls pls help me get that account of mine back. i worked v hard for it n i have almost all the skins n i seriously like all of them v much. Many thanks.",
        "This is the best First Person Shooter available on Android. The only game that's not pay-to-win. Ok I give you that this game is great, but damned login issues are the reason for 3 stars. I just can't LOGIN with google play. It's like the game decides when I can login and play coz sometimes I am able to login. REST OF THE TIME IT SAYS PLAYING AS GUEST. FU!CKING FIX THIS LOGIN ISSUE!!!!",
        "Well they still have to grow but I think it's op. As I play a lot of CS:Go (not sponsoring)  then I thought this could help me because my PC stopped working.. Anyways graphics aren't great but good.. They aren't clean. Oh and last before I end this comment- when you complete offer for credits it doesn't give you the credits.. That's sad..  So yeah.. Just keep it up!! 👍👍"

The card backs and faces are cool, I just wish that shuffling through the cards and reshuffling was a little faster. Overall, I love solitaire and play it A LOT, so this game is okay by me.",
        "This would be 5 stars except exiting doesn't exit. Using the \"Back\" button to leave and close down the game doesn't work. You're locked into the game end screen and are left to tap the recent apps button then kill the game using the \"X\" else tap the \"Home\" button, which leaves the game running in the background. Clearly the developers don't know Android as well as iOS, which doesn't give the option of exiting gracefully like Android...",
        "Only thing I'd like to see changed is to have the option to skip all the whooptedoo after winning a game. First couple times, it's cute, but by the dozenth time it gets tedious. Apart from that, I'm a happy player. (EDIT, a couple months later...) Another real nuisance is the continual request for a 5-star rating even after I'd given one. As a consequence, I've lowered my rating. Still worth playing, but there's serious nuisance value.",

        "Its pretty great overall but I dont like the fact that I cant expend anymore after level 60. Id love more space since you need to put lots of decorations for challenges . I also think there should be hearts every good bubble not just one out of 3ish. When you need 100 hearts its a long time getting them. Besides that very great game, still play it!",
        "Sadly I have decided today to uninstall this game. I've been really enjoying it but it is simply too resource hogging for me and keeps crashing. I think it needs an option to turn off animations especially when building etc.  EDIT. Since getting a newer, faster Samsung tablet the game has improved for me immeasurably. Excellent!",
        "Amazing game! Very similar to the original RC Tycoon, but a few added changes to make it more interesting. I've only encountered one major glitch where my park was erased and instead was given a friend's (I still had all coins, tickets, cards) but I had to rebuy whatever rides and buildings I had that my friends park didn't BUT they reimbursed me for it and gave me enough coins to rebuild my park (probably twice over thh). So overall a great game and great customer assistance too!",
        "Usually ill make it to level 10 in other games like, but this has been the only one that can hold my attention for so long. Just hit level 40 a figured it deserved a review! 5 stars from me! I love that you dont have to wait for anything. The missions just keep popping up regardless of how many you finish. If I didn't have any responsibilities I could literally play all day long.",
        "My very first tychoon game and I love it. Very addicting! Can't stop playing. Such fun building your own amusement park. Could have a tutorial you can click on whenever you need to know how to play but, other than that, really good game."

        "Perty good Edit: We're in the middle of an event and the game won't load. Finally says down for maintenance. It would be nice to get a heads up on when that happens. Gonna put a hindrance on the event that's over on Friday. Do hope it's resolved soon. Still like the game tho, but would like it better if I can play.",
        "Well a very basic game, as any other idle game. Has no real extra things that would wow you. Notifications less than a minute after closing the app (or simply pressing home) can get very annoying. As if I need a notification to tell me I closed the game.",
        "Right.  First off, If you are not a fan of Idle games, then don't play. This is the epitome of an Idle game.   The Early game is pretty simple. Click, Collect, Make your way to Level 80. You have the option to buy gold, but I wouldn't bother.   Multiplyers come from a variety of Sources, and regular events give permanent boosts to the Main game.   Good to pick up and play for 10 minutes at different points of the day, Deep enough to just about keep my intrest beyond this.   Issues. Events: They keep adding new things to Events and not really following up on them. Betting hasn't been used in a while, Costumes are confusing, and the card collection in a previous event was a fairly obvious cash grab, requiring that upgrade the cards you have using gold.  Event's are often straight copy pastes of previous events, and will sometimes continue to reference previous events'  All in, pretty good.",
        "Well guess they deleted my last post cause I complained that the game took up 1.8 gig till I uninstalled it and reinstalled it then lost my saves because of bad programming.   Don't waste your time or money on this company.",
        "One of the best \"tap\" games. Love the satirical theme. Who would have thought that politics and money were SO interconnected😁. Just to be clear to some, I AM being sarcastic!!!! Great time waster. And that's NOT fake news.",
        "They put so many buttons to purchase things ion the main screen. When tapping as is the nature of the game, it brings up confirmation for your purchases. If you're trying to play fast, you could easily spend $20 in mere seconds without noticing. Put all the purchases in one place instead of cheating players."

        "Graphics are good. The app can eat up ram and CPU a bit, but for a game this detailed and expansive it's to be expected. The controls aren't quite as accurate to actual touch locations as I'd like, but other than that, this is a lot of fun. The original game, Black and White, was great!!! And this is to. Different features to the game, but that, too, is to be expected. You can choose to watch ads to aid your progress, but they are not intrusive, which I appreciate greatly. The game really isn't challenging in the beginning, but I haven't gotten far. This is totally worth the download. Great, great job devs, thanks for all the hard work!!!!",
        "I have shelved all of my other games to focus on my addiction to this game! Great graphics, amazing concept and very little ads compared to other free apps out there! I do wish there was more information available on how to increase the happiness of your followers... as it seems that no matter how much you build and gift and inspire they are always behind the Astari! A little work in developing a help section would go a long way! And some more diverse purchase packages would make it more appealing to pay!",
        "This is the best game I've downloaded from the playstore, ever. It doesn't bombard you with ads and you get sooo much content! You even have the option to watch an unlimited number of ads for free gems if you so choose, and gem costs for items are totally reasonable. The story is cute and interesting and the graphics are pleasing. The controls are also very user friendly. It's been like three weeks and I'm still addicted. Superb work guys!!",
        "This game is mesmerising. The graphics seem simple, but they are so elegant and beautiful. The background music is good too. Edit: I got addicted to the game, and that cause its a game that absorbs you in. I had previously rated it 5 stars but now, the game won't open at all. It stops working every time, is all my progress lost now?",
        "Was looking for a settlers type game when I found this.I love it. It is a calm and addictive game. Love the story boxes ,I can't wait to complete the story, (I bet mrcreepypasta on YouTube would knock a narration out the park). Really enjoy the landscaping element, just waiting on the seabed ability now. Only bugbear I have is stickers seem to be very difficult to obtain. It seems boxes are few and far between once grey cleared areas have been checked.",
        "Seems like it could be a cool game. Didn't mind the ads until they started just playing the sound on a black screen. Timer runs out and no x to continue. I restart the app but I have to get past an ad to open a pretty important menu. (Galaxy note 8)"

        "This game used to be fun, but now there's hardly anyone on it so you can never keep a volley going for long. Furthermore, it seems the only people who play anymore are the weirdos who just write the word instead of draw so you can guess, which makes the whole game pointless. Like, the heck, dude? They want all the points and none of the fun. Ruins the entire app because that's all you ever get anymore.",
        "It is interesting and addictive game to play with friends. I would have given 5 for everything but for some bugs. One is it takes along time to load. Two there is a bug where even if the game loads we cannot see the drawing. Please fix them",
        "Too many ads! I liked this game years ago, forgot about it and recently downloaded again. I would of hoped that things would of improved but no. The annoying \"do you need a bomb\" keeps popping up non stop. Wish they would of added more brushes by now since it's a drawing app, it just makes drawing much harder since I use it on my mobile phone. A paint bucket would also be nice instead of coloring the whole page.",
        "Redownloaded this game after not playing for a while and it's pretty similar to before, but the amount of push notifications is making me uninstall again. I have notifications turned off in the app, yet I still get a push notification what seems like every hour. It's so unnecessary. So I am happily deleting this app again.",
        "Needs a much better chat function. Can only communicate once per round!   Some of the words are ridiculously bizarre!  A lot of the words are repeated over and over again.    Oh yeah, STOP asking me if I want a free bomb! If I want them It's already very obvious where to get them!",
        "The game it's self isn't bad, it's the notifications that's annoying. Even if you turn notifications off you get them 4 or 5 times a day. It's pretty annoying."

        "This game is fantastic.Incredible graphics, incredible animation. The story could have been presented better with actual audio, And the fights become quite repetitive after a while. I suggest that on the \"campaign\" the fights wouldn't be as repetitive, to be different, and not so simplistic. The character designs are marvelous there is no doubt on that. The gameplay and controls are ok besides the repetitive fights. The boss battles are incredible at best. If I would rate it from a 1-10, I would give it an 8. So much potential that can be well executed.",

        "This is an idle game with effort and pretty fun writing, with a lot of ways to feel rewarded without cracking your wallet. It's obviously not the driving game but if you want an idle/clicker, you can't really go wrong with this one. The character diversity is a genuine highlight more games could take a note from.",
        "The fast pace of the game keeps you hooked.  They don't throw ads at you but certainly make them available for great benefits.  It's not clunky at all which makes it easy to pick up and play a couple minutes here and there.  It's a ridiculous concept of making money off taxis/fares, heck I'd move to the cab driver profession if I made &gt;$500 million on one fare... but funny and fun nonetheless.",
        "I really like this game a lot. I'm not usually into these idle games, but from all the ones ive tried. Ive enjoyed this one the most. Other then the occasional slow down, it mostly runs great. And the model for ads is very very fair. If you decide to watch and ad, you always get some kind of reward out of it. But its completely optional.",
        "It's okay and the graphics are really nice, the sound effects are good but ultimately, you play and play and play and play and still not got to the other towns. I've got to about the 7th and had enough of trying to get further and not progressing much. It's okay for a few days but after that, and like someone else has mentioned about the ads, too many to get little rewards",
        "Huge battery drain compared to any other game i have played including the new tekken and sims mobile games which are much more graphical. Will sometimes lose game progress when you completely close the app (so not running in background). Taxi's occasionally get stuck on buildings or vanish off screen completely. If it wasn't for these issues it could be a much better game.",
        "Really fun and adictingl but for samsung galaxy core prime this game has A LOT of bugs and glitches. Tried to play for more than five minutes is making the phone first freeze the screen then restart itself. Some cabs never arrive. Need a lot of bugfixes right now. Other than that it is a good game that i like."

        "Oh boy this way funny! I think my ears are going to burst! XD Anyone who gets it, try playing a song backward or in overlord. IT IS HILARIOUS!!!   You did a great job on the effects, and even when i had the ghost playing the brightest song it sounded creepy. The dragon also made me want to hide as it sounded like it was stomping around as the music blasted through my ears.  Overall, great app. I might be using it on halloween... XD",
        "The app works wonders! The cathedral effect is my favorite (it also makes your voice sound a thousand times better, lol). There are some effects I'm not a big fan of, though, and I think they're not that interesting, such as Poltergeist, Android, Cyborg or Devil. Still, this is the best app for voice effects!",
        "This is the best app! You don't need to talk or to record your own voice in order for this app to change your voice. All you have to do is to type what you want to say and.... That's all! You git my 5 Star, greetings from Philippines",
        "This app is surprisingly a pretty efficient and versatile little gizmo! It has actually quality effects and is super easy to use. I find myself downloading it again and again whenever I need sound stuff, because I keep getting roped into bigger fancier apps that get too complicated and expensive.",
        "I like how you change your voice and record anything like barks, nerf guns, singing and growls. It might be cool if you added a GROWN-UP voice effect you know for kids, plus people who are already grown up could see what they'd sound like double grown-up! PS: Your video \"IS very funny\" No, it wasn't funny, IT WAS HILARIOUS! :D",
        "Nice effects, but Death, Dragon, Evil Puppet etc. All sound very familiar. I think the Death one should have a much more echoey scratchy voice, Dragon should be super loud, superior, scratchy. Same with the fly, shrinking, and small person etc. They all have super squeaky voices  Make them differ And maybe add a girl voice and a man voice so you can just be plain man or plain girl :p Its very good and I like how you can record it, so I can now troll people with the zombie voice."

        "Like the game BUT WAY TO MAMY ADS. No game needs this many ads, I can't do anything without an ad popping up. It is really getting on my last nerves, ecut down the amount I don't mind a few but not that many.",
        "The amount of ads is ridiculous! Especially from that \"Tune Blast\", it's really annoying. And, w/some of the ads you have to wait 30sec before they're done, there's no \"x\" button. The actual mahjong game itself is decent.",
        "Overall, I love the game. The only thing wrong is that there's too many ads! I can't even go from menu to menu without an ad popping up. It's very irritating.",
        "I think there is a pretty critical error about the card arrange. I have just played today's game (12/2) and found it impossible to complete it. There were only one pair of cards with two dots and they overlapped each other, which of course I could not pair them up. And there were three pairs of one strip appeared.",
        "It would be better if there were more tile choices, besides the basic 3. What really annoys me is that if you pause for a few seconds to look up or think of a move, an ad pops up. A 30 second, non skipable ad. The ads are also there after you finish every match. I know you need to make revenue but jeez. Calm down."

        "Great game but on small problem. I can usually get the easy ones done in 10-17 minutes, until I get to an A. Ries \"easy\" puzzle. When I do those it turns into 45-50 minutes. I can do the medium puzzles in just under that time.  I think they are misclassified and should be look at. Other than that they controls are great and provides good entertainment! Ty.",
        "Never mind.  Took me awhile but I finally figured out the system.  Maybe I'm just not seeing it but when I come back to playing I can't tell which puzzles or packs I've completed.  Could we have a check mark or change of colour or counter bar to indicate which packs or puzzles have been completed?  Easy controls and easy to see size for my tablet.  There are some ads if not purchased but they don't pop up unexpectedly and are quickly closed after just a few seconds.  I wish other dev's would take note of this.  Since I will only be using easy to medium puzzles I probably will not pay nearly $7.00 but if it ever goes on a 50% off sale I just might buy.  THANK you for your reply.",
        "This is a really good crossword puzzle app. I'm not too keen on the ads. It is obviously American so us Brits do have to really think on some of your more homegrown clues. All in all I am thoroughly enjoying it as it keeps the little grey cells working.",
        "Great game. Good mix of easy - challenging puzzles. Only complaint is that when the app is open, even in the background, it will cause my spotify app to pause music every couple minutes, so I am unable to listen to music while playing which can be frustrating. But that being said, I still thoroughly enjoy this app!",
        "The game is well made. The content is often lacking. There should be report features for crosswords that are incorrect. Larry H has several mispellings in his crosswords, making them nearly impossible. \"Aron\" and \"Navaho\" are so blatantly wrong, I wish he couldn't submit his crosswords anymore",
        "Excellent puzzles! Sometimes a bit USA orientated (sports & politics) but general knowledge is universal. The hard level is really hard, easy makes you think hard too sometimes. Does not use up data in the background. Recommended."

        "Love the game. It's fun and interactive but have only hit bonuses and free spins on the first game. Been playing for awhile now and not once did I hit the Wheel of Riches or What's in the box. It's bit deceiving that you have to increase your bet to activate the Wheel of Riches or What's in the Box when it rarely or never hits. At least allow those to hit once every thousand spins or something.",
        "This game is awesome. Love the graphics, sounds, and games. Makes me smile everytime Ellen talks. Silly I know but I absolutely love Ellen and this game is amazing. My 3yo son loves taking turns with mommy and we absolutely love the bonus games! He laughs and gets excited everytime we win!!! I wish I could give it a million stars!!!! HEY ELLEN MAKE A KIDS LEARNING GAME TOO PLEASE!!!! but seriously this game is relaxing and fun! If you haven't downloaded it yet, DO IT!!!!! ♡♡♡",
        "My mom loved you so much. She passed away Dec. 18th. She would've loved this game you have. I play in honor of her memory and well, i love you to. Been a fan since before your johnny carson appearance. Wish i could go to your show and play a game for the fun of it and to meet you. Sincerely, Tim Simpson",
        "Ellen, love the candles that light up to spell your name. Clever. The reels in your games are Hurkey jerkey. Smooth is better. Solo, where is the box in What's in the Box? Where is the reel in wheel to riches? Your pay outs are much better on max bet. Took me a while to get to 100M. Keep up the creative good work.",
        "I keep watching the ads to get extra coins and none of them get awarded. I never get the wheel of riches or multijackpots or what's in the box no matter how high I play. I've played SO MANY times on the #Imatellen one and the heart emoji is as big as it gets but I've never gotten the bonus game. These glitches are ridiculously frustrating. Honestly if they don't get fixed soon I'm just gonna delete and find a different casino app.",
        "This game is so great. I play it in my free time. Not normally a slots can but this one is so much fun. The fact that you start out with 5,000,000 dollars is awesome to me. If only those were real winnings hah !"

        "READ THIS NOW!!!!! i love it it is very addictive a great time killer and once you start playing it you can't stop unless your battery is dead.how you play it  js t hat you make videos and then by tapping ijt you earn money an d when you have enough 🤑$$$ you can buy a pug and then he has a store and you buy stuff for it. You also can put stuff in your backk yard. And you c an change the way you look. And the best part i s you can buy really cool stuff with the diamonds and you can earn more subscribers. Thank you for reading this it took me 2 min.to type it",
        "This game is so edicting. I only just got it and ime loving it. I allredy have a rell chanel but this game makes making a vidio simple and fun. All you have to do is tap pres publish and boom you get nice coments good vuis and nice suggestions. Man oh man am i adictid to this game. Good adictid it really really is such a good game. That my freind is why i gave it 5 stars and recomend it to evry one. It is just as good if not better than peudiepies tuber simulator. So pleas get this one",
        "I get that free games have ads. That's fine. But you can't get 20 taps in or switch to a new tab before you get another 30/50 second ad. I thought this was just a fluke, but it keeps happening every 30 seconds like it's on a timer. This game would be fantastic other wise. Uninstalled it after the first half hour.",
        "I found that this game is so addicting till you got like 100000 views ever second... then it becomes very boring... but I do recommend it to people who want a game to play for like 2 weeks but don't expect any big reward for play long... I just want tapps to make something rewarding to getting higher like designing your gaming setup or actual able to make a video and upload it to the game... overall good game",
        "Surpisingly fun.    I'm not a big fan of clicker games, but this is defiantly worth it. The game is not overwhelmed with adds, and you get to customize your character. However, when you reach a certain point in the game, Its not fun anymore. Tiers just take time because of the progress gap, and there is basically nothing to do. If they added more stuff after you reach the top, I would rate 5 stars. Can you please add a update to fix this issue?",
        "Surprisingly fun. I'm iffy on idle clicker games but the reviews convinced me; there's lots of unique aspects to this game that other clicker games don't have. It's competitive, which is cool, and you can actually customize the upgrades. The main thing that makes me stay away from idle clickers is that there's no customization. In this game you can customize your room and yard, character, and even choose the videos you post. Lots of fun stuff to do, definitely worth a try."

        "Below is my earlier review. As of today, 1st December 2017, I'm on level 3410 and the game is not moving forward to the next level. What's happening?   This is the only logical, fun and satisfying bursting games I've played till now!   Just one suggestion, you should give more ammunition for the black balloons rounds.   Great game! 👍",
        "I was looking for a simple game to kill a little time and that didn't require too much concentration. This fit the bill perfectly. I didn't care about point scores but if you do you might find this a bit frustrating because the point scoring is pretty ambiguous. Otherwise this is a simple but fairly entertaining diversion that can be played for a long or short session while you're trying to fill some spare time.",
        "I would love this game! I even reached level 3410! But it doesn't let me progress from there. I am stuck after completing 3410. There's some glitch. Please fix this!!!",
        "Cant get games 162 and 163 they are not there and find it keeps freezing.. very frustrating",
        "It's the best. While I am babysitting  my young grandchild(1Yr)old  he can help me play too. It is the best game ever even  my husband wanted to  install it.",
        "I've downloaded this game several times and when I get over level 100 the game doesn't load the next level. I wish they would fix this gliche."

        "Simple game that had the potential to be fun but the fact that you can't dodge the spears is stupid takes a lot of the fun out of the game.  Bug: Any score above 19 doesn't get registered for some reason. I got a highscore of 19 and after that even if I get 22-25 kills, the new highscore is never saved. I think the app is not counting the added points for headshots.",
        "Great game, but what's next? Have the Spear of Infinity (cool) and have reached 420 kills. What about an exploding spear (BOOOM) that clears the entire field. Especially those fireball buggers. More aggressive opponents too would be nice :-)  Thanks for a fun game to pass the time with. Cheers!",
        "Great game. Too many ads EVEN AFTER YOU PURCHASE THE ADD FREE UPGRADE. Point scoring makes no sense. Upgrades are practically useless. A few tweaks would make this game a classic. Unfortunate that the developers have chosen to be greedy and lazy.",
        "Absolutely love it, two suggestions though to perfect it. A sensitivity adjuster for finer aiming would be cool, but most importantly, could we please have an option to select a single background colour. It's jarring having the background changing all the time. Great work though!",
        "I really do enjoy this game. but it had suggested I download another of one your games called \"vikings\" in exchange for 900coins. afterwards there were none awarded or no indication of how I would recieve them. I hate stupid ploys like this or even miss direction whatever it may have been. I'm actually considering deleting the app because of it.",
        "I unlocked one of the special abilities and it is hard to use in gameplay.  I would be in a game and as an enemy shot an arrow at me I tried to click the small button on the bottom right corner but I wasn't able to because it was too small.  I would suggest that you make the button bigger for convenients. Thank you."

Only thing that frustrates me is the fact that you can only achieve a new high score if you play from the current level you are on and upwards. You should be able to go  back to a previously passed  level and have the ability to get a new high score that way. Other then that, great game!!",

        "It's a good game overall. The in game support is minimal to non existent. Your better off asking players for support. Its a good team building game. Like every other game like this it's pay to win but with strategy and a good team you can still have fun. Again it's a good game. I just hope they sell to a smarter company with better skills in game development and customer service (because without customers, you don't have a game) and then this would be an even better game. Give it a shot just get a good active team and don't expect help from customer service. Be careful buying packs and if you do screenshot EVERYTHING. Hope this helps",

Ask anyone in bf 62",
        "So many glitches to what could be a great game....slow on fixes....no lvl buffer so watch out for maxed out players who love hitting low players...be sure not to come to bf74 as it has been held hostage by a single player called Welpia and his corps ROK.....YOU WILL BE MISERABLE.....numerous unanswered complaints to customer support by numerous players....numerous players. May rage quit on this bf....attempts to get cs to act have failed....other wise a great game with great potential so long as you dont get stuck in a bf with one who calls himself Welpia or any corsps. Named ROK or Kor",

        "Cost of everything in the game is particularly high. And gems??? Don't even get me started.  They just dropped some limited time dragons in the game, and the cost of EACH them is OVER $100 if you haven't been able to earn that many gems in game yet.  Which takes a very, very long time.  Uninstalling today, casual players beware.",
        "Very relaxing game. I wouldn't say it's a \"time killer\" because after playing for hours you'd probably spend a lot of cash out of your pocket, if you don't want to pay this game calls for lots of patience. If you have PATIENCE you will NOT have to buy anything. I've been playing for almost 2 years now and I have only spent 30$ on the game and not because I felt like i had to but because I just wanted to; to speed the game play up a bit. I have gotten every dragon so far, even the event dragons, and limited time dragons, etc. Without  having to spend any gems. Sometimes it takes days of breeding the same pair but it will work if your persistent and patient! :)",
        "Concept-wise the same as with many breeding games. It's fun, a nice game to have for here and there.  Generally good ideas were implemented into this game. Most dragon designs are really good. Unfortunately I don't understand some of the mechanics in the game like removing something from the market makes you lose this item? I mean the last time I have opened a market on the street, I kept my things I put for sale. :? Please fix those logic flaws.",
        "It's fun enough if you don't take it too serious. I could write a long review but I was in the middle of playing when the game kept asking for a review, kind of annoying. But in all honesty this is one of two games I have consistently played for a long time now, so I really do like it.",
        "I really love this game...i have this one and the other DragonVale. I have alot of fun with my grandkids breeding the different dragons. I will say tho that I would have given this 5 stars all the way across if it didn't take so long to get some of the dragons. We have been trying for the Knarr dragon for months and can not get it. It is very frustrating. If it wasn't for the new events that give us a chance to breed new dragons I am afraid I would have uninstalled this due to it taking wayyyyyyy to long to breed certain dragons.",
        "I've been playing this game for a LONG time. And it continues to keep my interest! It's so fun! And with the constant release of new dragons and events, it stays fun. I wish there were more events, but Hey! It's a great game! Expand that market place though..."
