        "Bright, colorful, addictive game play. Adorably happy graphics. Love \"Mr. Encouragement\", who exclaims \"sweet!\", & \"delicious!\" in his baritone voice. The music isn't my favorite, I find it somewhat creepy. Greatful for the music mute button.  Thank you Development Crew for a fantastic, free app which I have been playing for years! One suggestion: make it clear $3 gets you one-time access to your piggy bank only. ThanksüòÑ",
        "good way to teach us to be patient should we prefer to play freely.   Occasionally error.  KING, to make this game more enjoyable, .wld you pls kindly give us PIGGY BANK freely so we can still collect and use our gold? .pls give brief explanation on new things we're abt to encounter, e.g: HOW TO PLAY, the use of NEW THINGS.  thanks KING, jia you",
        "I just completed all 3185 rounds... took nearly 2 years to do so. A couple of suggestions...  1. Some big reward must be given to the one who completes all the rounds... an uphill task. 2. All these years I played the spin wheel every day ... but not even once the jackpot was opened... it simply shows the malintentions of the programmers who programmed it as such. 3. Boosters must be given more often.",
        "I love this game but level 3166 is impossible! Once you take out one licorice another drops....you need to rethink that level, because it's a level that will make people stop playing.... doesn't matter what boosters you use the licorice keeps dropping and you can NEVER clear all the jelly!",
        "entertains well. but plz try to improve the swiping feature ncz when we want to play the first or second episode ,have to swipe all over down n got fed up with that, its taking too much time to do so. its really urgent to improve that thing.",
        "Very disappointed in this app over the last several months.  Every time I go into app to play game I get kicked out.  It is not always immediate which is very frustrating because I will loose lives etc UN-necessarily."

        "I absolutely love this game and have loved it since it came out. I was never too much into Pokemon but this game has made me love everything about it. It's great meeting new people when doing raids and the new gym system is much better. My only improvement would be maybe to make it a little easier to do raids in rural areas. Perhaps lowering the CP, or giving a person more time to complete it alone compared to in a big group. Can't please everyone though! Keep going Niantic, we love you!",
        "I impatiently waited for this game for nearly 2 years. I play it with my 2 best friends and it's changed our lives for the better. We get out more and get much more exercise these days. I love collecting Pok√©mon and I intend to play Pok√©mon Go forever. Niantic hasn't yet delivered on all their promises, but they're working diligently and I'm very happy with the game so far.",
        "The battle is rudimentary like always, but that's not what I'm writing this for. Add the pal pad to the trainer menu please. It was an item that the games had to keep a list of your friends. I think that would be a great addition. Have your friends from around the world registered via usernames something to keep an eye on their level up and medals and even pokedex progress. It would be a nice addition I feel the game misses as an often times multiplayer game. I.e. raids and community events",
        "I enjoy the game play and weather mechanics and new gyms quite a bit raids are also awesome great idea. I think what would bring alot of original players back is trading pokemon. Then later down the road pvp battles. I hope you take my reveiw into consideration Niantic Inc. From one person who grew up with pokemon these would be great features for the game.",
        "It runs quite smooth and gives me an extra reason to get out and exercise. My only beaf now is that it is impossible to acquire any of the legendaries. If you live in a small rural town you will never have the numbers to take on anything beyond 3 star in raids. Everything else is awesome though.",
        "I am currently on vacation and this app has given me more points of interest than using Google Maps alone!!  Every single pokestop is something interesting...  I don't know why I didn't think to use it for this sooner.  I've seen more in this city today than I have the 3 days I've been here!"

Wasted 3 years of time and data on this worthless app.... recommend not installing or uninstalling it... customer service sucks",
        "Ive played this game a long time. New update and instead of making the game better you screw your customers. I lost all my boosters and you expect me to continue? If nothing else its a matter of principle. You punish me by taking everything ive bought and earned, ill punish you by never giving you another dime and i will let everyone i know who plays or asks about any of your games ro stay away.",
        "So frustrated with all the candy crush games. I periodically get angry enough to quit for awhile,  but end up back. Why am I upset? I was just in the middle of a rare winning streak and had earned a number of special candies to start games with. I was up to 2 hour on the fish, multi color candy, and the juicy jawbreaker, with 3 hours of life. Suddenly,  i still had the life but all other rewards disappeared. This is far from the first time. I am tired of it. I am removing the king games and I am not coming back this time. I get glitches happen but I have never had any  Indication  that anyone gives a damn. No one makes anything right or even says,  sorry. I'm ok with a game having issues but I am not ok with being treated less than.",
        "In places with bad connection the facebook popup bug is also annoying and causes you to have to restart, losing lives and the streak. And having to click different buttons to confirm to end a game is stupid design.",
        "Would love to give a better rating, but after the most recent update the game has very bad lag, worse than the usual lag it's always had. Updating this. Was hoping update today would fix the lag. It didn't. Also, adding 2 extra steps in order to replay a stage sucks. You know the old saying; if it ain't broke, don't fix it.",
        "EDIT: Update on 3/22/18 fixed NOTHING! New levels still locked as well! Worst update in candy crush history. Riddled with bugs. It didn't add new levels like it should have. Unlimited boosters don't appear on level when they should. And boosters are no longer allowed on lower levels. I'm at level 2100 something. I should be able to use boosters when ever I want! And I should be able to have unlimited boosters appear on all levels, not just when they feel like it. Fix and I will give more stars."

        "Nice game with very good events but the drop rates to heroes of 5 star is too low i killed a lot of gems and scrols and hero orbs and my first 5 star i  dropped it at lvl 75. Okok now again event of summoning 100 scrolls and i continue still no 5 star hero only 4, just try and fix the drop rate. In the rest its a nice game.",
        "It's a good time passer.  Beware of guild system, it has major flaws. If a guild leader doesn't log on in a while, The guild gets given to another.  When it happened to me it picked the newest, least trusted official, rather than the one who had been there since day 1 or one of the two who actually donate resources to the guild. So we easily lost months of work.",
        "I purchased the spring festival card on top of all the money I've already dumped into this game and the devs didn't give me my in game rewards. I've submitted numerous tickets to get a refund or my rewards and they just reply there is no problem. Ya no problem with you taking my money.  They deleted my review, wonder how many other people had this issue and had reviews deleted.",
        "Wasn't sure about this game at first. I love it. I use a f2p  and a vip one  to see  the difference  between the two. Really well done. Having said all that the game does require patience. This is an IDLE game. You pick it up do dailies, talk, spend money, or what ever you want to do in game, then put it down to \"farm gold,xp,mats\". The high end heros do take some planning to aquire as a f2p player. This game requires patience because it's an IDLE game. Yes some people have a ton of money to throw at the game but don't be jealous, just play your game and have fun.",
        "There is certainly alot to do, but is there really much to DO do? I've just been continually tapping red dots and getting free prizes, which (although nice) doesn't feel like I'm especially earning anything, you know?  Feels like a game that will keep you occupied for maybe months, but a year after you delete it will you really REMEMBER it? Probably not.",
        "Not what I expected, given that my first impression of it was of IH being an \"annoying add\". Once I decided to pick it up though my thoughts changed rather drastically.   It's simple, it's fun and the warm colour palette of the graphics make a nice change compared to the widespread use of bleak colours in other games.   If you think you might enjoy this game, you sure are my friend."

        "Great fun game. Only reason I didn't give it a 5 is because you go through your money pretty quick buying boosts to win levels to then upgrade your garden. I like the game a lot. Also I think that at the end of your board if you have undetonated items they should detonate at the end of that level. I've lost too many levels because of not getting one item that was next to something that was undetonated.",
        "I Love Gardenscapes and It Is Fun Way to Be Creative.  A Recent Update has Made it Definitely Better.  The Support Team Has Been Exceptional With Quick Responses and Answers!  There is Room for Improvement in the Amount of Coins Obtained in Completing Tasks, as Well as Eliminating Repetitious Tasks Requiring More Moves.",
        "I love home scape but it can be quite spendy. Both games are fun.  Love graphics animation laughter now free gifts.  Gardens cape is even more fun doesn't get boring like home scape when pay to win is obvious.  Gardens scape takes 1 or 2 coins with easier quests.   Still favorite.  Home scapes got greedy please return again where its not pay to win.  At times we need a color no bonus and lose because home scape didn't offer the color.  Spending hundreds on home scape so thinking of my budget and returning to garden scape.  Gardens cape started it all. Please lower prices",
        "Either make the puzzles easier or give more Passes to actually be able to pass the level ....make it easier to get to other rooms, too many attention to details..also so many tokens should be able to buy a few stars... I've been on the same room level since I started playing and way past level 100. Starting to get bored at this point.",
        "Much has improved since my original review (see below). There are special events going on quite often to help with earning coins and powerups, and the levels don't seem to be as tedious. Keep it up, guys!   \"I love this game but the levels are often too hard to beat without power-up help, and it takes so long to earn coins. Most of my friends have quit playing\"",
        "The reward for finishing a puzzle is around 50 to 60 coins. It cost 900 coins for 5 extra turns, and 1200 for the next. It has taken me up to 3 weeks playing all my lives as much as possible to finish 1 puzzle. This game is designed to frustrate you into spending money so you can complete the puzzles. Which I wouldn't mind if it was rewarded more fairly. Play Monsterbusters, it is by far more fun, you earn better rewards, and you can buy new lives and power-ups with your coins at a much more fair rate."

        "Homescapes is an awesome game, combining the relaxation (and frustration!) of match 3 games with the joy of renovating a fabulous mansion. Throw in the fascinating story line, lovable characters lovely music and stunning graphics (except the kitchen wallpaper lol), I'll be playing this for a long time! I'm working on the living room right now, getting close to level 800! Thank you Playrix!",
        "Its a mind blowing game i cant help but to play this game my day seems not complete if i cant play the game specially when i cant pass the next level and the hardest part is the hard level the time are very fast when i am playing.i really love it and the freebies i can get everyday to boost my game.thank you creators and the makers the graphics and the animation is very realistic.",
        "This is really exciting BUT the levels get way too hard!!! I want a game that you don't have to replay a level more than a couple times! That's when I stop playing. It's a game...it's supposed to be fun not rocket science!! It should relax you but when you're played a level 6 or 7 times and you get down to needing1move to win... yet again... you get stressed!! And the levels should be concentrated on tasks to fix the house not on things like starting a new day or talking to someone to fix something! PLEASE fix these things so it's fun! I like a challenge but this is ridiculous!!!",
        "Just gave it 2 stars from 3 stars, everytime i use the kite booster it doesn't work and wastes it by flying away. Continued is my previous feedback. Love the game but it is ridiculous how we need stars to start a new day etc. It is difficult to get stars anyway. The lives go out fast because levels are hard. It take 900 coins just for 5 extra turns to finish the level but you get 45 or 50 coins only per level. You need to change this. Make it on the same level, give us atleast 1000 coins per level and let the level have enough stars per task rather than 1 star per level and requirement is 2 stars per task. Something to look into.",
        "Game is awesome... sometimes it takes days to get past one level which is dumb.... wish I could move ahead in the game faster... would make it more enjoyable.",
        "Getting green pieces gets extremely redundant. After 30 levels it's still the goal. Levels are near impossible unless you get lucky and things line up perfectly."

IGG only wants pay to play players with the upgrades and fixes they have put in this game. The game is fun and would have more people keep playing but once you play for a while and see it takes an ungodly amount of time to do anything in this game people quit. IGG really needs to look at this an make the game more enjoyable for all!",
        "Love this game some people p2p but you dont have to. To level up does not take long and its easy step by step. Also if you you run into events you are not sure of how to do most pros help out . I also love the fact you can send items you need to other like food.",
        "This is a pretty fun game as long as you don't care that IGG doesn't care. I've enjoyed the people I've met (And they're really the only reason I keep playing).  Unless you spend an ungodly amount of money it takes forever to be able to participate with the big guys (and theres ALOT of them. ) Plus there are many glitches that IGG won't ever own up to or reimburse you for. Itsnlike a vending machine play, and pay money at your own risk cuz if you lose, man you REALLY lose.",
        "I thought this games was amazing. Spent a ton of money and it was fun. Then one night, after putting up a 24 hour shield, I was zeroed. Requested IGG look into it and requested reimbursement. Unfortunate that their glitches cause so many issues. They have so many glitches that they cannot find any abnormalities in my 24 hour shield dropping after 6 hours...  will not spend another dime on this game, and I do not believe anyone else should either",
        "This game needs balance. Seems like all one does is hide behind shields and gather resources and hope higher might players harvest you for your resources. There should be a limit on how weak a higher might player can attack. An individual with over 100 million might should not be attacking someone with only 10 or 20 million. This game isnt a war game, its all about hiding behind a shield and being a resource collection for pay to win players",
        "Pretty good. 4 stars because I never liked the time it takes to do stuff. I know it is profit making, but I gave 4 stars because it is manageable and they do have lots of free instant completes. This is waaaaaaaaaaay better than clash of clans... JS."

        "One way to check how much products I have left is by touching the machine and thr corresponding product but sometimes the game will assume  that you are putting the product into production hence it will put the product into production whether you want it or not so it will waste production time. Sometimes the touch is too sensitive. Sometimes the touch is not sensitive enough which forces me to drag the product into the production slot up to 10 ten times just to start production. I know this feedback is not much but maybe an undo button will help. It makes the gameplay million times difference if you  put your players comfort a priority.",
        "Long time player returning to the game after taking a break. I leveled up to level 41 today. Before leveling up it showed I should get 1 white and 1 black rabbit with the new level but I didn't get either of them. I would also like to see it a bit easier to get wildlife refuge animals. 36 puzzle pieces seems a bit much.",
        "They keep taking my diamonds and telling me I spent them somewhere. Like I spent 19 on fast tracking 1 Coco tree while I have Tom for 6 days and 102 Coco's in my silo then tell me they can't refund it because I'm a liar! They took 50 from my husband and only refunded him 30!! Super cell is ripping players off!!",
        "I absolutely adore this app for it's witty, adorable characters and simple yet infinite concepts. I'm addicted! I have one issue, though. The limits on the barn and silo, frankly suck. I have eleven duct tapes but no screws so I had to pay diamonds I didn't want to spend so I could have a little flexiblility! Please fix this.",
        "I buy an axe it will last forever same thing with other tools but here I have to keep buying tools to do the job. An if I need more crop I get the land ready for more seeding get the water. This you have to bring in more people that never show up to do the work. That's why if I'm going to farm I count on one person me. Here you need others. It not for me.",
        "Love this game. My mom and I play it 24/7. It's addicting. Annnd it's a great time killer. Just like everyone else there are things that I would suggest to improve the game. Like for example the time frame for waiting on items. Crazyyyy long. Like the fish nets are like 14hrs! Could drop all the high times to half. That would be cool. But of course if you guys did that then it would be super easy to level up. And you guys would loose out on money cause there are some impatience people out there that just go ahead and buy diamonds and such. Anywho. Love the game. Please consider some of these people's suggestions. Thank you. #HayDayFan"

Curious to see if they manage to respond properly this time",
        "I have been playing this for 1.5 years. I love everything about this game. They always have fun events - usually 2-3 events occur at the same time. You can play them all or pick the ones you like best. As a f2p the game presents many opportunities to acquire in game money (especially during the events) - hoard it for energy refreshes. You'll find yourself in very few dry spells needing in game money and energy.",
        "I love this game! I play at every opportunity I get. Thanks for helping me set up the game on my tablet. I have however, run into another issue I hope you can help me resolve. I have a three star awakened dark pixie, when I tried to evolved her into a three star I tried to use other pixies and they only leveled up her skills, so I used two other monsters to evolve her. This happened again when I tried to evolve her into a four star. Please help!",
        "If your into gathering  monsters to strengthen and fight aswell as evolve then this game is for you. It's very fair and rewarding depending on your efforts. Further expansions for this would see the current fans gain more pleasure out of it and it's already a great game. Liking they added 2 new monsters but seeing that as a regular thing and still keeping current top summons valid would be incredible. Speedy gameplay and no issues for me. Username : violentmaw",
        "Been playing this game for years. Really enjoyed for the first few years. But while years of time past, the rune drop rate and 5* monster summoning rate still remained very low. Its very sad and depressing. Now i just login to settle my guild wars then log off.",
        "Been playing this game every day and it's extremely addicting. Gameplay and graphics are wonderful, support is great, etc. However, it seems to have really become a pay to win game. You'd think that with all the mystical scrolls, summoning stones, attribute scrolls and crystal summonings I've been summoning, I'd at least get a natural 4 star character but i can't even get that. I get garbage every single time. Its frustrating when you put so much time into the game and get nothing in return."

        "I am playing this game in a long time. but i have found some issue.. many time i am not get shield & someone attacked my village. How to upgrade my village. Pls tell me Moon active team & also upgrade spin 50 to 60 & also redused village manufacturar cost... Thank You.",
        "Game was running successfully but now game has stopped working in my phone all of a sudden, I have uninstalled the game and again installed but not working. My mobile handset is Motorola g5 plus and android version 7. Please help me out to resolve the issue asap.",
        "I actually liked this game but recently very glitchy/buggy. I get attacked by the same person twice within less than a min of each, same with raids. I earn for attack/raid master and the counter doesn't update. Freezes in the middle of spins. Don't earn coins for watching videos sometimes. This is even after the most recent update",
        "its a nice game, but please rate the places lil bit low, it's hard to earn money, and when we save it for a place to buy, a raid takes place... increase the spin no. also atleast from 50 tp 60... it was fun at first.. but due to all this it's becoming boring.",
        "I'm honestly speechless at how simplistic this game is, but it so fun! It's so simple to play, everything about this game is just AWESOME! It's super addicting, a great time killer, eveeything is just great about this. I don't usually rate games but this one made me rate it, keep up the good work!"

For example i just been upgraded to th10, i dont have infernos , i dont have 3rd xbow and im getting maxed out th11 bases to raid in crystal league. Similarly maxed th11 players are raiding my base sucking all my loots with all maxed troops , lvl 50 king/queen and lvl 20 warden...This is because i dont invest money in this game.",

After Builder Hall 8 update whenever I click by boat to go Builder Base the game shuts. I am not able to upgrade my Builder hall. SUPERCELL you are super we know plz fix this issue and let me know. Plz reply to my review. And give interesting offers on normal base. There are no good offers now. I am very happy to be a memner of COC family. ~King SB  Clan~Ganking Geckos",
        "This is a perfect game..but you should give us a short way to make our town hall level 11.. You should give some event everyday.. make tournament.. what you have give us that is like a league not a tournament... Give a tournament Like football world cup.. first there will be group stage.. knock out stage .. that will make this game so much Enjoyable and more and more interesting.. This is a request to you #SUPERCELL PLZ MAKE THIS HAPPEN..THIS WILL MAKE THIS GAME A DREAM GAME.. MAKE IT HAPPEN SUPERCELL.. LOVE YOU",
        "HI SUPERCELL . some players ruined the clan because of Clan Games. Why? They will join ur clan and check if we already achieve the reward like book. They will earn 50 or 100 points and leave the clan. Pls do something about this issue. The CG rules should change like They will get the reward depend of how many points they earnd. Sample: 1500 points they get the reward from tier 1-3 even though the clan achieved the last tier. Pls fix it. Thanks",
        "Super game my favourite game really nice guys download it .I have A small request if we have got any bonus in war or Multiple battles it automatically goes in Clan Castle ,and when we want withdraw it give whole treasure comes out. So if U keep a device ,in which we can type how much  amount of  treasure we want to withdraw. It will be great honor if U put it in next update.",
        "A nice game. I will always be in search of games. My Friend recommend that this is nice game. I installed it. He said that join in my clan. I joined in his clan. Now I am playing this game wonderfully. Thank you super cell and coc. But only the problem is maintainance of server.  It says try again later.  That's why I have rated it 4‚òÖ.

Makes us feel like it's only about the money... it should be fun and enjoyable but that's hard when everything takes so much and so long.... Make the money worth spending.",
        "This game has been glitching for the past 20 hours. can't log in. have reinstalled multiple tjmes. my army will probably have been wiped out by someone who has spent 120,000 dollars on his account (yes there are people who have spent that amount and that's what you're up against) glitch laden game. admins don't give a damn. I will get a standard response to this... if any. Don't download. don't play. don't waste your time and money.",
        "It's a good game but the issue is that much higher level players can attack you regularly. And this sets you back on your development. Level 5 players should not be being attacked by level 20 players. You rebuild an army using resources needed to grow only to have a higher level player destroy it again and again before you can even rebuild completely. My army took a day to rebuild and before I could yluse it it was destroyed again. And more resources are wasted. It is a distressing pattern that has put me off the game.",
        "I love how the game is. Our kingdom 489 have the peace treaty. We dun attack others tagged clan bases. We let them grow. But I currently now facing a problem whereby I can't upload my picture profile. It sucks. Help me and you get ur five stars rating. Get back to me asap. I've been trying for abt a month and nothing change",
        "This game changed my life and how I live... Up until now every so called \"strategy game\" has been full of nothing but disappointment but then I came across king of Avalon and I was astonished that such a game existed. The graphics are breath taking and the community is truly like your in another world... 5 stars!!!",
        "You will have my 5stars back if you just remove that K.E. in the gold event!!! Or maybe just make it 1 day only!!!  It sucks that all my troops were killed because of that. At least maybe if someone attack a city, not all troops should be lose half of them maybe. How can i gather  resources to heal them if only few left and takes millions or thousands resources to use for healing. Un installed!!! It sucks really!!!"

        "So it's kinda fun but I'm rating it low based on the cost of purchasing character shards versus how many you get. I tested it out and purchased a ton of purple diamond things and purchased character shards that gives between 5 and 330. Out of 7 purchases at 1299 each, I got a total of 41 shards. So for roughly 9100 diamonds, I get 41 shards. You do the math. This game apparently enjoys taking your money. I've mentioned this to the developers with no reply. DC Legends knows what they're doing when it comes to purchases of character shards. At least they make it easier",
        "Very addictive. I started playing casually, and 4 weeks later I find myself checking it all the time. It's best played with at least a minor investment, but reasonably ftp...if you got patience.  Add: it's been six months, and I'm still hammering away at it. It has a huge base of fans,and I've only needed customer support once (and they handled my issue very well and quickly).  Still a bit grind-y, but great little bit of clicky gaming.",
        "This game hooked me up. The community it is very helpfull and growing evryday.Check youtube videos befor you start playing this game because is a griding game and you will need patiance and a good guidance at the start. It is not p2w you can play it as a f2p but you will need patiance so dont worry about money...in this game money will only save you time not exclusive content. 5* from me this is for sure the best mobile game ever. May the force be with you.",
        "I Personally would like to have the ability to upgrade stars on heroes easier without spending real money. Get 2 to 3 stars on the characters for free leaves me wanting, and im just not spending money on a game like this. Otherwise it is a fun game. Even though it basically can be a full time job you dont make money on and have to spend money on. So if you dont mind commiting months to barely make it to do the late game stuff amd still have to spend months to progress. This game will be great. This review is for those who play ftp games without actually paying to win.",
        "The game is fun enough but to sync it with your Google account to have to give your phone and all its abilities to EA. Why is there a need for the game to access my photos and make and answer calls? How 'bout I play a game on my phone with cool light sabers and fun music and when I need to make a call I'll stop for a bit. Just let people play and EA can make bank with their microtransactions. GTFO of people's personal info.",
        "The game is a lot of fun if you are willing to put A LOT of time into grinding things out. They have made huge changes for just quality of life things, but they have kept the core game the same. Grind, grind, grind, grind, and grind some more. You can get everything in the game just by playing it. No need to pay anything. However it would be a lot easier if you could spend 1000$ on the game every couple weeks lol."

        "The game sets a new high standard in bland average. THE DEAL ISN'T TRUE TO LIFE, IN ALMOST EVERY SINGLE HAND DEALT (in tournaments) THERE IS MULTIPLE ACES & PICTURE CARDS. However for a poker fan that doesn't know this game it's worth the gamble lol. The game play is good, poor player avatar customisation options as it's simply a small selection of picture options with zero options for using one's social media profile pic. This means frequently there are multiple players with the same profile pic. It struggles a bit as a social game of cards because conversation is limited by time, you can sit at slower tables allowing for better chat but not in tournaments. It has nothing to stand it out & above other poker game apps for either negative or positive reasons. If you just want to play a game of poker with random people from around the planet though it won't disappoint. It does give the option to buy top up chips and a daily option to get chips for free from both in game buddies and a poker machine. From the entertainment point of view it ticks all the right boxes but it's not the best poker game on Google's app store. If it was food you'd spit it out because it's bland, not sweet nor spicy but porridge without sugar or sweeteners.",

        "Love it.  I kept seeing ads for it and thought it was just another crappy rip off game, but I figured I'd give it a shot, and I'm so glad I did. Game play is fun, there aren't ads every 30 seconds, the app runs smooth, and the artistry that went into designing this game and the characters in it is absolutely flawless. Can't complain at all. Great game, I do recommend to anyone who likes puzzle and strategy games.  10/10!",
        "Awesome game. Sadly motivated by profit grabbing providers. The cost to buy extra lives is astronomical. The only way to buy on a more viable basis was via the piggybank and guess what. They removed it. When I questioned this I got standard fob off bull. I questioned that and guess what no reply. A shame, it is a great addictive game. Just don't get tempted to get you wallet out..........",
        "Zainy!  I can understand the addictivity of it, however, just as I was getting into each level, surprise!, is was completed! This spoilt a bit of the fun for me.  The catchy music, oddly I never got tired of hearing... Great game!!!  This review is after my first experience of the game which I played upto level 20 before stopping.",
        "Sounds boring but I'm loving it! Sucks you right in. Starting to get a little complex (actually using some real brain power) but still very much doable and no charges as of yet and I'm up to level 10 atm. I am no gamer by any means but I'm really enjoying this.",
        "After my anti-matter laboratory had a slight malfunction and destroyed half the houses in my town I discovered that I had a lot of time on my hands. So I discovered Toon Blast. Been busy ever since! Thanks guys",
        "Awesome game! Thanks to the developers for not only making this fun, but doing it in a dignified way (i.e., no annoying ads). I love this game! It's fun, addictive, and challenging enough that it's still entertaining 500 levels in! Love it, can't say enough good things about it."

        "I started this game when it first came out. There were hardly any game advantages and everyone was having fun and on the same playing field. As more and more packages got released into the game it became a pay to win situation. I personally do not think spending $100+ on a phone game is a wise investment. Thus I enjoyed the game by taking advantage of their events and the prizes within the game. However, it has become dominated by people who payed to be the big guy and the little people get absolutely demolished. It has taken the fun out of playing, which really dissapoints me as it was a fun game to play.",
        "This game has potential to be fun but it's completely ruined because IT'S COMPLETELY PAY-TO-WIN which sucked the fun out of the game that I quit. Don't get me wrong, Final Fantasy is highly respected RPG franchise because it's full of great games in the series. But no this one.  However, I might come back if the game developers make it not as pay-to-win as it is now. Right now, it's a complete money bucket!",
        "This game is great and fun, I love spending my time playing this game. One problem though, what is going on with the packages? Why is it every time a package is bought all the packages go from 20 to 100 dollars ? We should be able to buy the 20 dollar packages more than once! Is that fixable? Please cuz i do want to keep playing but 100 dollars is too much.",
        "The game is very addictive and fun to play. Some of the people playing the game are wonderful and fun to game with. Graphics are very good for a on line game played on phone, tablet or computer. The quests are challenging at best. BUT!!! BE WARNED... This game is not for young children as there is explicit language and cut throat people playing the game. After all it is a war game and nothing more. Now down to the nitty-gritty of the game. Yes it's free, but that only get you so far before you will need to buy packs in the game to advance and unlock the two new characters. The game quests are designed for people to spend if you want to get ahead fast. Large amounts of  $$$$$$ Cash are needed to play this game. $$$$$$ Personal note, I know people who have spent thousands on this game. Over all the game is great for young adults on up. PG-15",
        "I absolutely LOVE my guild!!! Everyone is so cool,from all over the States & all over the world...have friends in other guilds as well from all over the world...my guild is like my \"family\"...some of us have even talked about meeting up with each other...I hope to finally meet some of my favorite people,especially our guild leader...we're like the best of friends!!! Although,he lives in TX & I'm from Michigan,we're both married ,but there's nothing I wouldn't do for him!!! Thanks so much for giving me this opportunity to meet such wonderful people!! Lifelong friends/family!!! üíú",
        "This game is great and will make you feel tho go all out. It challenges you in a healthy way and keeps you on your toes. Join a guild, trust me. You can do a lot by yourself but joining a guild in this game is actually fun. I haven't experienced anything toxic, yet. I've been playing for about a week and it's really great"

        "The makers of this game have put their soul into it, bringing into life every element of the game. The characters are charming and beguiling. I'm in love with princess. üòÅ It's the only game where I've invested real cash, and have received  its full worth. The game is an epic. I love it. Cons: Although I've purchased gems, and bought legendary chests, I've only received relatively less efficient cards like lava hound and graveyard which help in game play only if complemented with other cards. It's a bummer. I think they want me to spend more to enjoy more desirable cards.",
        "Think you should be. Given a legendary atrandom at start a,nd a random rare in chest would be cool was expecting that..but no just normal cards.hope I get  cool legendary one day.like. the chest idea hope you bring in armour card add on.like spear guy could have ice spear or flames.plus that's cool extract cards to collect to make your cards even better and unique. Thank you my supercell friend.this game oh almost,st forgot.bbbbbbbeest 2 v 2 game on mobile,!!!!!",
        "I don't think I need to 'review' much here. There are some points I definitely don't like about the game. Such as the matchmaking... You get matched with the same deck type in a row. Other than that and some minor flaws it's a great game. I love the competitive aspect about it.  Finally I would suggest some 2v2 with different game modes, such as ramp up 2v2. Also, add the rematch button in 2v2 challenges with random mates.  Hope I hit the 4,3k this season. Good luck to all clashers!",
        "I think Clash Royale is a great game to play and is very well put together for all ages, it is a fast paced game and at the same time can be played with an individual pace of your own to a degree being that there is a clock ticking, also new characters are released at a well balanced rate, so that the game doesn't become boring and the regular balance of the characters strengths and weaknesses are balanced to make the game more competitive. I recommend this game for all ages and abilities. It's great for a few minutes or an hour or so and this game also has several different tournaments you can enjoy yourself or with a friend or a teammate. See you soon on Clash Royale. A.K.A. Dad.",
        "Supercell, I think your best game is hay day. Clash royale on the other hand isn't one of your better games. Android is better than apple. Why would you ever support apple instead of android. You released Brawl Stars only for apple. You should have less medieval/fantasy games unless you make the knights, princes etc. More realistic. In my opinion I think you're better at making farm and army games. Please make more of thoseüòñ",
        "This is the only game of its kind. Many companies try to copy, but this is the original and the best. There are  endless possibilities of card combos and decks that you could use making the game always entertaining. My only complaint is that the trainer is way too easy to beat. It is one of few games that you could get competitive without using your own üí∞. I also like how the stuff that u unlock in the beginning does not go to waste later in the game."

        "I really love this game, i've been playing it for nerely 5 years now and although it can be hard to progress without paying money it is possible. I am free to play which can make it hard but for the people that are not willing to pay money igg is there for you, every week i can earn up to 1500 gems which is probably the reason i have yet to quit. Other than that the leveling and many heros makea the game that much better.",
        "I up my rating to 4. After playing 5 years, this game is really fun to play. I cannot give 5 star as i still having issues with the gem price too crazy expensive. Hope igg can revise gem price back, so many player can support this game, not the rich guy only. I believe you guys has realise many p2p player already quit, so better to revise the germ price again. Overall, i love this game^^",
        "Decided to edit my review to clear things up for people that says this is a money making scheme etc. To the people that say that, do u understand that this game is Free? The devs spend a ton of money making a game enjoyable for people, adding new content such as, new heroes, new events, new upgrading features etc. It's only normal to lock some heroes behind a paid service, and the heroes behind the pay wall isn't even game changing or op. U don't have to spend a cent on this game to make progress. Rolling heroes takes time but it's so rewarding when u get that one hero u were looking for. This is a great game and if u complain about ingame purchases for a game so well maintained then rather go play another free game full of bugs and zero updates.",
        "Holy cow, sitting at 100k might but leveling goes so slow now. Please do something, and new quary is really annoying and sitting in the way.  Edit: everytime I open the game through notification is doesn't load the game.",
        "I hate it. It's always connected to those fake link downloads ugh and if i donwload this game and run it for 30 seconds, the link will open BUT NO it's a lie. This game just wants to be seen as a game with millions of downloads and I HATE IT."

And if you want to join the game now, you are too late because small/new cities can't stand out you have to keep hiding in your shield all the time, where is the fun in that? Unless you spend 100s of dollars on the game you cab achieve nothing. Also now your personal achievement will only be granted only if all the clan wins a battle which is not always easy. If you can't attack you can do nothing and it takes ages (weeks or a month) to build an army to compete. A game that consume money and is no longer fun is a fail game. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME!",

Can this problem be solved or should I deinstall all king games I have? I have no problem with games from other developers, so this is on you, not on me.",
        "Have played this game virtually since it first started it's a great game but why do we haveto buy the gold bars we have earned throughout the games I have never spent a cent buying anything! Shouldn't most of the gold bars be awarded to us for being loyal gamers ‚ò∫",

        "I enjoy the game BUT.... I payed ¬£2.99 to open the piggy bank to collect my gold bars and when I tried to collect them again, I have a pop up telling me that I have to pay another ¬£2.99 AGAIN to collect the 50 gold bars I have earned from completing each level! Nothing states that these are one off payments and that you have to pay everytime you want to collect your 50 gold bars. I never normally spend money on games and I most certainly will not waste any money on this game again! What an absolute rip off. When a gamer clicks on the piggy bank, I think that the notification should state that you have to pay the ridiculous amount of ¬£2.99 everytime you want to collect your 50 gold bars.",

        "Been playing since goblins vs gnomes (2014) and still play today. Not a diehard player, but as my buddy put it, \"hearthstone is the best toilet game ever\". It's pretty simple and easy to learn. Newer and f2p players have a bit of a rough go, but you can easily keep pace in this game for less than $100 a year.",
        "It's a fun game for a while before you will get frustating. Too much depending on luck no matter how good your deck is if you couldnt get the card to do your combo its useless againt an opponant that have better draw than you.  Also if you are free to play you have to be petient to get ass kick for a while till you have luck enough to get some useful legend card.",
        "I love card games and this got some awesome elements. However... The randomness and luck in this game is pure bs. You can be in a winning position and still lose because of 1 in a 10000000 chance of the oponent getting lucky. Even when I win I feel bad from winning because I know the oponet was unlucky.... It is very rare I get a game where I think. This game was awesome because we both did our best.",
        "I never even got to play. I have now tried to install 3x. The first two times the app became unresponsive. The third it caused my phone to crash and reboot. I have a pixel which should be perfectly capable of running it. If not then don't offer it for this device. First blizzard product that's ever pissed me off.",
        "Great game! Love all the really cool animations! I do have a problem that since I installed the game, my store has been closed üòê I am installing it on PC right now to see if I can get to the store there. Game play is awesome though!",
        "Really fun game. 3 stars cause it closes very easily. If I get a phone call even when I dont answer the game closes.even on wifi it closes. Then it takes too long to reload causing me to lose a turn. This is the worst in arena because losing one turn will kill you and it becomes a waste of gold. Please do whatever you can to solve this problem."

        "I was expecting this to come out soon, after all another build a medieval city clone. Nothing original about it. I play it only because of GOT theme. How to keep people playing? -Don't make the screen so congested. -Make stuff like buying a second builder permanent, not for 2 days.  -Basically don't make it P2W. If you don't get what I mean look up how EA messed up with Starwars Battlefront 2",
        "Alliances are complicated but use the chat feature and folk will tell you or PM you. It does take up a bit of time..IF YOU LET IT, but overall, not a bad game. Loads to do...follow what tyrion tells you. Wish I could find particular resources for crafting or I'm never gonna have a level 10 helmet haha. Have fun...don't let it rule your life",
        "12 days is an unacceptable amount of time to respond to a paying customer's problem. Is this the only way to get attention of WB? I have submitted ticket 5 times with no answer!",
        "Unless you completely have no life and plan to spend every waking second playing this i do not suggest it. I downloaded it to have to kill time but unless you spend plenty of money on it and are willing to dedicate majority of your day, you will probably be bullied and attacked by the ones who have no life and spend tons of money on it.",
        "Real truth! This game is built on your discourage to upgrade without buying. You can increase your castle but you have to spend real money all the time. Their rewards vs investment is 10% for you. You will spend your whole credit on this and still not be eligeable for the iron Throne. This is WB best scammed game out there! Things you 400 of to upgrade, only come as 6 units or less a month which pushes you to buy 100$ packages to upgrade. WB is laughting at you!",
        "Too expensive. The in-app purchases cost about 5-100 ‚Ç¨. Those players who pay that on a regular basis dominate and win the game. Those players who don't are currently about 50 times smaller. It is like fighting off tanks and stealth bombers with flintstone and spears. You will lose."

Now it seems that they limit the amount of points you can get at the end for the moves you have left. The only time you see points is the total at the very end. Seems like they're screwing the people who want to get 3 stars on the levels...",

        "This is an awesome game.  Especially since I love decorating.   Few things though,  how about pillows on the plain sofas, modern pictures for modern furniture,  traditional scones, etc, for traditional designs, and more diamonds or stop using extra sofas and expenses that take away our diamonds. We need more accessories for the tables like books, vases, and flowers, also how about some better pictures because your choices are by far not worth $1000.00.  Last but not least, more colors in furniture with two or three toned designs.  That's what designers look for.  Thank you! Still love the game.",
        "Lots of fun. Unfortunately, the other day I had to do a factory reset on my phone. When I installed Design Home afterwards, all of my designs, progress...all of the money I've spent on the game for over a year was/ is gone. It created a totally different designer number (profile) for me. It wasn't connected to my Facebook for privacy reasons, but now? I don't know if I can keep playing, if I have to start all the way over. If you want to play, you'd better link it to Facebook.",
        "The game is addictive. I wish that we could see who we are up against in the voting to better understand the rating we receive. It would be great if we had the chance to buy limited accessories 1 more time. I love the new challenges that we have received in the last few weeks. I've noticed every time you make an update that I have lost some furniture why? I do not like that you have increased the dollar value of buying the highest amount of gems. I won't buy again. Losing intrerest real fast.   Thanks again.",
        "I super loved this game and I am glad tapjoy is back.  I just have an issue lately.  I completed an offer lately but never got rewarded.  It says it might take 24 hours for the submit button to appear so I can contact customer support but it's been 3 days now and it still says pending.  I have no other way to report it.  Please look into this. Voting is an issue but it's the players who are voting and they vote for whatever they think has a better design no matter if they follow the requirements, you can only use a furniture for a limited time and will have to purchase it again if you want it.  I understand those things but I hope the reward for every design completed is higher than 500 so we''ll have more to spend and make the furniture more affordable.  Otherwise, this app is one of the best!",
        "I love this game concept. I also like the \"borrow\" option but I don't have anyone to borrow from because everyone I know stops playing because it's too difficult to advance (achieve 5 stars, which is the quickest and nearly impossible way to do so. Impossible because your advancement is based on user preference). A \"sort by price\" filter would also be cool for those of us who enjoy this game but are on a limited budget.",
        "Cannot get the app to load properly, but it is a really fun and addictive game. Great challenges, and I like seeing what designs others have come up with. I've won challenges with very little money, it is possible, if that is a concern for people. I would like to see challenges developed more quickly, and ways to earn more money. I usually have very little money to work with. Maybe have an option to get keys or money when voting. But overall I really enjoy the game."

The AI will always take advantage of beating you with moves that will take what you need 98% of the time. Moves that no one can see but magically the AI knows what to choose to beat you. I love strategy games, but cheating is not a fun for anyone. The AI compition is not a compition. It's a slaghter waste of time until you get lucky or they give it too you. No strategy there. Just piss you off cheating AI. Being the top of Candy Crush and Candy crush soda. And yes also Jelly. It is ridiculous sometimes to waste my time with this one. If the AI opponents played at the highest level of what to use, then I wouldn't mind getting beaten. But when you watch the AI make the dumbest move to get what it needed, tells you that the AI sees the whole board. Even what is hidden. Give up or beat yourself up on this one. I seem to love the Gluten of punishment, lol.",

I'm playin a level w/ the Monklings, like 124/6 if u watch closely if u catch a long, 6,7,8, row on Monklings KING WILL NOT ALLOW U TO HAVE THE WHOLE row. Watch the number counter not the monklings going under the rope & u will see the counter not go pass a certain number! THE SAME NUMBER continues like 6 will stay 6 4x's! That way u don't beat the level & u have to buy a booster, KING Co are CHEATS!",

        "I enjoy this game a lot for their variety of games. I will say the starting bonus is very generous. The clubs are fun if you find a good one to be a part of. My only issue is the payout system... It seems when you make a decent win, your chances of winning anything are greatly reduced for a period of time,on any game or slots. No jackpot yet. The ads are not bad.. At all. I won't give up.. And I'm not the only one who notices the payout system.. I won't put my own money into this game just yet.. And if I run out I'll uninstall. But definitely give this one a try if ur looking for a good Casino Game.",
        "Warning careful with this game!  It's ok....hard to win anything. I 've spent quite a bit of money in this game. In the last week ALOT!!!! Both my Husband and I play I explained I could no longer seem to win anything . My Husband played on my device and his own, same room same exact bet. He spent a big sum, my device lost he could not win anything at all but he win 6 billion on his device. We had club members play exact game we was exact same bet, they won big my device won NOTHING AT all. Seems odd. Be Very Careful with this game. I do not believe something is right. After spending a VERY VERY LARGE SUM you would think a person could win a good sized jackpot. NOPE. I will not buy anymore.",
        "This game is very well choreographed. I like the theme music it plays . I like the fact that it give lots of hi winnings. The backgrounds are nicely colored. Very  adictive games. My favorite\"ZEUS SLOTS\". Not fair, I'm not getting some of my winnings. I will take off a star for that. But I still love this game. Although I have been playing this game for a while, and it has improved alot. Now my favorite games are HERCULES, THE MUMMY, and the DIAMONDS SLOTS, and the FRUIT SLOTS. Now I LOVE this game. Some of the game slots needs to up beat the music. Some games are slow, sleepy music. I have always loved this game. Its a lot of fun. It keeps me motivated. My newest favorite game yet is\" WILD STARS\"  . However, \"ZEUS\" I feel that it need to update its amount of pay. And add different characters and music. Love the actionüòÑ. This is always an exciting game.üòâAh, always an awesome game.üòÜThis is a wonderful game to play when your on vacation. Just awesome. I love this game, exciting wins. This will always be my favorite game.",
        "Enjoyable game, lots of freebies.  I now need to change up my review.i had made a purchase in the game during a \"Spin and Win\" promotion, that purchase stated that I would receive 10m chips for every 2k league points, at end of promotion, I did not receive any of my chips as promised per promotion advertising. I followed the process of getting in touch with Huuuge Casino and was told once that someone would be in touch with me, as of this listing I still have not heard back from anyone.",
        "So i liked the game enough to over look the constant in app purchase ads and advertisments that are timed perfectly to get you to accidently tap them. But what just made me uninstall this game was this: Twice now i have hit raise or bet in texas hold em' and instead the game folds my very obvious winning hand. Whether it is a technical issue or not, i dont care. There are better games out there that dont have this issue, and i suggest you play those instead of this one.  Phone Specs: Galaxy S7, fully updated OS, apps, etc., Verizon service provider.",
        "I have always been a loyal player at huuuge casino and can safely conclude I will continue for a long long long time. Why I said this? Simple - huuuge casino has such a wide varieties of games to satify all sorts of players. Huuuge from my experience not only practise fair play policy but also quite generous in giving free chips.  My plea to the great support team - please do the needfull to bring back Merlin Casino, Melbourne Casino and Singapore Casino. Texas hold'em held there were really superb and loved by many players. I don't understand why they vanished after maintenance works were completed.  My many thanks to the support team - you guys are good! Keep up the good work and CHEERS to all of you."

        "Great potential, but there needs to be a way to earn free gems for the abundance of chest I have... Also there needs to be time to clean up the map once The main objective is completed and definently more chalice for chances to complete levels, I only have a certain amount of time to play so I need to fit it into my time, not yours.... Ok game but not a great game for the players, micro-transaction heavy and very little chances to complete the levels.",
        "Really enjoy the game. Relaxing and addicting. However, i dont like the large amounts of lock chests taking up my camp space. I think the lock chests are too much of a push to get me to buy crystals. Chances of getting crystals seem slim and with the small amount of space available for other things, this is a down side for me. If i have to pay to open chests that i have been rewarded, why play? That might be  something that causes me to quit the game before too long.",
        "When I first downloaded this game it was fun...now, all the dragons only have a stamina of 1 and now you need trophies to play levels. These trophies take f-o-r-e-v-e-r to accumulate. These things have made the game drag on way too long. And accomplishing any thing may also cost actual money now. I have read other reviews about the money system of this game and I will not be throwing my money down this drain.",
        "Loved this game at the start. But since last update it has crashed on me several times. Today alone it has crashed on me 3 times. I lost all my camp progress each time and had to start again and of course each time is different because it is impossible to duplicate. Today I also lost my dragon gems and dragons I had created prior to crashes. There fore I lost my money spent. I also lost my daily chest which  contained 2 life trees and a super egg fragment.  I am very upset and dissatisfied now and regret spending money on this game that I loved prior to all the crashes.",
        "Please remove The Challenges. The timer runs out too early on all of the challenges, all the way up to challenge 20. I have all the standard levels finished. I have been waiting for you to make new standard levels. The timer is cheating people in your challenges. There is no way they can be completed. I am not buying 50 gems to add 2 minutes. That's a waste of my money.",
        "The game is great but customer service is non- existent. I bought the 30 day gem special that was supposed to come with an egg and fountain. Got the gems (so far)but not the extra items. Tried contacting customer support several times but following their M.O., they never respond."

That means you can progress through it without even spending a dime. Its a simple game with decent graphics to play at leisure and has become my current pass time.  Update 3/22/18  I decreased my rating to three stars (from 5) until the developer can correct the latest flop from most recent update. Flop regards being able to log in but paralyzed from any action that requires an in game pop up. I including the \"Help\" module which is used to contact dev with. If no improvement after a week, I will delete game and draw stars to 0.",
        "I've always loved this game, but my tickets go ignored for days. Latest update has handicapped me completely in that I cannot click on anything or log off 1 world to log onto my other world. The game is starting to suffer because of bad customer service. Reduced my rating to 1 star until they get their act together. To think I've actually spent real money on this game and can't get a timely answer."

Which is fine I just have to wait. But now my issue is that the actual levels for the wedding event, and the normal quest, it kicks me out of the app and it does thatt every time. Please fix this issue. Maybe then Ill give it five stars.",
        "Great addictive game! Starts out cute and innocent. Recently found out through a spoiler thread that it does take a darker turn in Ch 15. The U.S. servers are currently only on Ch 12. Still a great addicting game that many players start out thinking \"Awesome! A great game that I don't I can have the option to play for free!\" Soon they cave when that ONE outfit comes along that they HAVE TO HAVE lol.",
        "I love this game! It's really good for creative people who like to design their own outfits. I just downloaded on my new phone and started over (I don't have Facebook to link my progress with). Please make it available to link with Google play so I don't always lose progress!   Also, since downloading again, I found that some of the names are different... I was very confused, since the voice over still says the old names. I like Yoko way better than Bobo!!",
        "I loved this game, and am V8. So its not like I am against paying. I am against the ranking event especially since you devs LIED TO YOUR PLAYERS and said we wont be getting one again. We will not pay 100s for a non guarenteed reward. It would be more HONEST, if you set up the suits as 300 USD each recharge.  If you are smart at all, devs you should understand that business ethics is just as important as profit and will benefit everyone in the long run.",
        "Lovely game! Gorgeous clothes and gameplay. A little cheesy in. The story but fairly creative for a dress up game. Plus it can be hilarious with how wild the lore gets around fashion. Design can be a little overcrowded sometimes but everything is coordinated so it still looks nice. Backgrounds are gorgeously painted. Tutorial is easy to understand but isnt too tedious. I am officially addicted",
        "I never write reviews, but this game deserves all the praise possible. Downloaded it for my niece and turns out I am the one addicted!! I'm a daily player now and love the fact that you can start your own group for 300 gems and approve applications and interact with your stylist association members. That aspect took the game to a whole new level. The clothing is beautiful and the attention to detail is great!!! Give it a shot and you just may become addicted like myself. I do spend around 20 bucks a week, but it was just as much fun before I was spending money, I just wanted the special clothes for events."

        "Highly addictive. Great fun. Only downside Is, when you get to higher levels, upgrading buildings takes way too long. I'm talking days! Makes you forget about the game sometimes as you can't do anything else untill it's complete. I refuse micro-transactions so this game now only gets visited once every couple of days. It's a shame really as it's great fun to start with.",
        "Provided the developers with evidence of rampant racism, homophobia and misogyny present in the game. They have so far neglected to take any action against the perpetrators. Unacceptable.  Edit: I have already provided screen shots to you via the Help & Support board, you haven't yet taken action. Please do so immediately.",
        "I really enjoyed this game for a while. But anytime theres any sort of update the app wont load up. And it just so happens that whenever this occurs it's during a kill event. I cant explain how stressful this game can become if you actually commit to playing it",
        "This game is not made for people who do not spend money. The devs do not control the players who do and therefore those who do not never get the chance to grow because they are constantly having to use resouces to rebuild their troops and this takes away from being able to advance. The kill event being 3 days straight is for the birds . You got to buy gold to purchase shields or you resouces you work for are plundered and often times your army is wounded above your hospital limit so you have to constantly use resouces to be able to heal them.  I just don't understand why the game is for people who spend a lot of money and destroy the ego of those who don't!",
        "This garbage is nothing like ads show. It's a pay to win mmo that brings nothing new to the table. You can always tell a game will be garbage when their ads are fake. Uninstalled!",
        "Unless you are willing to line their pockets with cash your wasting your time on the game.  You'll never catch up to those who have been playing the game a long time without money.  Parents beware."

I can't leave message with development so this is the best I can do about that. But I love the game and this wouldn't change my activity amount at all. Keep up the great work development and look forward to new games in the future.",
        "Best game i played ever. But new update have some bugs like if we going to play with friends it take too much time for loading nd mostly notification pop up that there is an error your coins refunded in your account. Kindly resolve this issue. Except this best game üëç",
        "So I have no idea why I am always at a club disadvantage. My driver is level 5 and always vs a person with level 7 or 8. Why do I never go against level 3 drivers. Always vs higher clubs! ALL THE TIME! you might as well give them the win. Losing me as a customer because there is something very lopsided.",
        "The mechanics of the game are fun, but once you move up a rank or two winning is tough. That is an issue because gold (needed to upgrade) is earned thru even payout bets and very little gold is generated naturally. If you can't keep a high win % you either can't play or need to spend $$$. It's hard to win often when most games come down to closest to the pin shootouts.",
        "Constantly glitching now. Will select an opponent but pictures continually scroll and game never starts. Have to shut game down and start back up for the game to begin. On the verge of uninstalling. Will select opponent and never start game and I end up losing money. Forever downloading, takes forever. I always loved 30 seconds when I start the game up if it doesn't start up by then I just shut it down. Beginning to be very disappointed"

        "I like it.   The fish are friendly and encouraging.  I use the game to help me keep calm and relax.  Please consider allowing us to select another of one of the earlier aquariums when we get to the point where we are waiting for new aquariums to be developed and have finished everything.  I'd like a place to put new fish and decorations, but none of the old fish want to be sold.  They are still my favorite friends.  The game uses a lot of memory, and I had to uninstall it from my tablet because it kept making it crash.  Works on my phone, but it's still a lot of memory.",
        "Love this game!! I love the challenge with completing levels. There's days I can't get enough of this game. I play every day. I love decorating my tanks. I love when I get infinite time, but It would be nice if we had control over when to use it or the time would stop and be saved for when we return. Sometimes 6 hours is impossible to sit there and just play. One thing that would be nice is if we didn't have to wait 30 mins for a life to renew and could have more friends to  receive more lives and got to use the diamonds we earned amd not be stored in a bank to buy. Other than that I cant complainüòâ best game out there and I highly recommend it to all ages.",
        "It's a great game. I play it with my daughter on our freetime it's quite addictive. Its great that you get rewards if you have to watch the movies. The only thing i would change is the reloding of the lives. Half an hour for one life is too long. Every so often you get a few free hours, but you need to have free time to play.I love the fact that we can play using my phone sideways (landscape ) as I have a problem with my wrist. I highly recommend it!",
        "Fishdom is a fun game.  The puzzles are challenging. I would love to see a change to the gifts we can give our neighbors . Such as, the lightening, or fireworks, or an ornament for their aquarium. I would also like to see the diamonds we earn to be available, not stuck in a bank, to be paid for.  Limits could be put on it, of course, but the free one here and there only help once in any puzzle sequence.   Overall, though, its a nice game.",
        "I love this game I just wish it was more interactive with the fish in one's tank. Like when you pet them little hearts appear and one can earn happiness points with so many touches. I also wish that one could still earn something for previous tanks. I have no real reason to visit my first and second tank. I don't earn anything for more decorations and it doesn't get dirty and the fish don't get hungry. I feel bad for them, but I focus on my current tanks.",
        "Got a new tablet for Xmas.   Had game on sd card. Wouldn't transfer to new tablet.  Was on level 105.  Have to start all over again! TORTURE lol. Other games I would just stop but not this one.  I love It!  EDIT...STILL LOVE THIS GAME.  Highly reccommend it!  Some levels are SO difficult but still loving this game Oct 9/17.  DEC 2017.  Still adore this game.  Now my husband plays too.  Best game EVER!"

        "The puzzles are interesting, the animations are generally enjoyable. It quickly becomes a grind, though, where you aren't enjoying the gameplay, you're just trying to get past the timewasters of the daily challenge, or fighting the arbitrary points of the arena. The clan battles and Mighty Eagle challenge are the best parts, but you can't play them all the time. You have to grind away in the Arena.",
        "I just purchased a new phone. And being I'm using the same e-mail address i would have thought it would have started me at the same level I had been on prior to the new phone. Kinda sucks because i had spent a near fortune and was at level 64 ! Unless they can fix this I will remove the game for good. I mean I had every hat except the ones that cost 25,000. Now I'm at zero!",
        "RESUBMITTED: Arena games were sucked up by those high-card players or maybe cheaters. My power cards are the same, just like my opponent, or higher than my opponent's cards. When I slinging those piggies or blocks, it gives me lower points like 4 hundred thousand. But if my opponent slinging them all, it gives higher points like 7.5 million. I lost my winning streaks so I had to play again but it gives me same points so I lost again, sadly. I thought your arena games are really much fun, but they're not.",
        "Classic gameply bogged down by aggravating fremium distration. Havent run into any energy bars yet and already on second world. New birds add interesting gameplay elements but spells are an automatic win that add no semse of achievement besides skipping a hard level. If you want some classic angry birds but dont mind clicking through to get to it then give this a download.",
        "I really think the tower is rigged. 1 in 4 chance of getting the pig but it seems to happen ALL the time. Cant get past the 6th or 7th floor. However if you spend lots o money to buy gems I guess it can be done. Not for me I am out.",
        "He game starts out with tutorials, but they act like you've never played angry birds before. Theres a world map which is cool, but its not needed and is just boring. The worst part about this game is that you can only lose 5 times a day. I just want to play the game like how the original game played!"

        "Excellent card game.  However as soon as you get passed reasonably priced starter packs you cannot play the game and why not?  Because you play two games then you need to spend huge amounts of money so you can play two more rounds.  Then you need good cards and guess what you have to buy them through a lottery system like gambling highly addictive but after maybe thousands of dollars you get the card you want guess what you need to evolve your card and guess what you need to buy your reagents big dough yet again.  Then when you have spent all your hard earned cash you need to buy special weapons to give yourself a good boost to your cards.  Do you get where this game and a right game it is too. It relies on you getting addicted so you spend all your time and resources on an endless quest for something you will never have uninstalled buy buy.",
        "Amazing game, honestly, top 3 mobile game I've ever played, found an amazing guild and it's loads of fun. No paywall is the crowning achievement in my opinion. One thing, cause I don't know where customer support is, I started a Path of Champion level, and  on the first wave the game crashed and when I logged back on I had no key and didn't have a chance to beat the level",
        "Definitely pay to win. When you scroll up or down it thinks you are clicking on something. Stamina is a nightmare as when you reach a high enough level that takes more xp to level up, you can't play for hours as it takes to long to recharge. Should make gems easier to get for non paying players so it is more fair. Other than that pretty good.",
        "Number one of the best games I have ever played on my phone. I'm watching ads for bonus experience when sacrificing my cards. And I love the fact of that availability. Especially since it pays them which increases chances of more games like this one. Keep up the great work. Really helping my cognitive development of pattern recognition",
        "Great games. Controls suck.  You want to scroll and click a card instead (i know how to swipe) turns are fast paced..sometimes too fast. And as a starter...some of the turn challenges seem a bit unrealistic with the characters provided. Almost like they want to have you spend money off rip. Good game overall....but some things should definitely need work.",
        "It's a lot other games of this type. I haven't been able to find a problem with it yet. Great graphics although the timer is a bit fast when you're looking up connections. If you had a button that the players would push when they couldn't find any more connections, that would be great!"

        "This game is pretty good and nintendo/IS takes in community feedback. This is probably one the most generous of any gacha game out right one and there have been some powerful units given to us for free. Content is 99% free to play friendly with only 1 or so events that were very difficult for f2p. While its not a true fire emblem game, it is still pretty good for a mobile game.  P.S. there are some 5 star units that shouldn't be there. They are only there to gimp you out of another unit.",
        "If you ever were interested in the Fire Emblem series then this is defenitely a good place to start off. It's simplistic enough for new players yet at the same time it offers a lot of possibilities on how to build your units. It's fun to collect Heroes in this game and it's fun working on them to make their stats and strategy better. Each Hero has a fun personality and each one of them is well drawn by talented artists.  A fun strategy game that also can get really challenging in some of the harder quests.",
        "Great game. I've never played Fire Emblem before, so this app is a great way to see what the games are like and all about. I like all of the cool characters and all the details each one has. If you like RPGs or want to try one out, this one may be a good one to give a shot at. You don't need money to play either. You might just want to get yourself into the FE games series after playing this. ;)",
        "Been having this app for a year now and yet I haven't thought its a waste of space at all! It's extremely addicting and makes you want to play more. Its also nice how the creators interact with the community alot and listen to our feedback. Its also nice to have a game that's constantly worked on and it just keeps improving. The art and the voice acting it also a big pro for this game. It really does capture the characters personality,even if it is a few words. The art is simply amazing. I appreciate the artists for thier hard work. Would definitely recommend it if you like RPG games.",
        "Turn based strategy rpg. If you've never played a Fire Emblem, time to remedy that. Fantastic depth and graphics for a free game. This feels like a full blown complete Nintendo title I'd expect to see for $30 for Gameboy brand new. At the price of nothing, everyone should try it.",
        "This is a work in progress. I am a huge fan of Fire Emblem, Sacred Stones and I really wanted to love this right out of the gate.  It has made a good start.  All maps are a set size, something like 6x8, with two teams of 4.  No terrain bonuses, no special conversation where one of your characters can convince one of them to join you, ALL attacks result in hits of a predetermined amount, no crits/no misses, no permadeath.  Voiced characters are a nice plus from the old GBA days. This is as close to a real Fire Emblem game as a mobile, free to play will get, and the devs keep changing up stuff to keep it interesting. Great game!"

        "What have you done?!! This was a great game with a few annoying adverts, now it's just one long advert interspersed with occasional races. I have no real issue with adverts but when they stick on the screen and hide the X until way after the timer ends that's just offensive. And seriously - ¬£8.99 PER MONTH to clear ads? (Yes I know you get extras) - come on that's taking the ****",
        "Really fun casual game. Adverts are present but not too intrusive. Allowed to watch adverts in exchange for upgrades or items.   My only criticism is that it takes a while to get used to the different menu items as there's no instructions and the \"see as far as you can go\" sections are really expensive to unlock.",
        "I've been crazy about this game, but the new update is terrible because of the crashes and bugs. In the middle of race my touch screen doesn't work, the pedals either. Please, for god sake,fix this annoying problem, i can't play any more.thanks a bunch",
        "Fix the damn gas pedal. The reason why I lose half my races cause the gas pedal just magical doesn't want to read my finger but the brake sure does work just fine. Keep shoving ads down my throat and it'll be all 1 star.",
        "Money greedy game. You will end up watching ads every minute. You will be forced to watch half a minute irrelevent ads every minute. It's like these guys built the best game to annoy people with ads. Good luck. Played several levels just to get annoyed and uninstall."

        "I'm not a downloading games on my phone or tablet kind of person but I saw this game and decided to try it out. I loved it and played it all the time but then one day it suddenly stoped working when I was doing so well. I couldn't open the game anymore I tried many things and didn't work. I started a new game all from the beginning I had 55 cash in my town and all randomly it showed I had like 20. This game just wants you to keep making purchases. If you don't it will block you out.",
        "I love this game. I dont play a lot of games. Township just keeps getting better. Some things are a minor downfall to this game, like how you can usually get great items from the store, untill you need a product or item for a task or event item. Then unless you have the township cash to hire the dealer then its hard to get things done in time. Plus in order to complete some tasks, you have to sell everything in your barn to complete the task. You should be able to just harvest than sell without it subtracting it back from your task. But either than that its an awesome game...",
        "Something different and fun. I usually don't play these type games, but I love TOWNSHIP! Still having so much  fun with every level. AMAZING FUN! WOW! The HALLOWEEN decorations were so cute, I can't wait for Thanksgiving and Christmas. Loved the Cranberries. I'm enjoying Township more and more with each level. Year of the Rooster.  Greetings we're all gussied up for the holidays. It's Easter season 2018 still playing.",
        "Loved this game but I can't seem to get on the game now. I wait for a long time for it to start and have to sometimes uninstall and reinstall and wait for it to start again.  If It I do make it on I can't help other players by going to there town. I paid money on this game and play faithfully everyday. I'm feeling some kind of way about this. Please fix this.  Update: The bugs are fixed..Thank you",
        "It is fast pace and complex good for ny age,but it with it ads and constant up daes it is hard on your device. It can be played with out any cost, if one has the time and the patients. Other wise it can be costly.  If it a child playing it I would highly recommend supervision,not because of any other reason other than updates and complex issues.  But it is a thnking ame that is fun.",
        "This is one unique blend of many things made into a game that makes me feel obligated to keep coming back and keeping everything running in the game. It doesn't feel like this when I played HayDay. One highlight I have to mention, game cash (township cash) is generously given away in many form! No more worry of being unable to achieve this and that due to no cash available..."

        "Do not spend any money on this game. This used to be one of the best slot games until the developers got greedy. Payouts are small and events are nearly impossible. They try to make it all sound good but it's not. They also changed the customer service on here where it's hard to get anyone. You cannot message them on Facebook if you have a problem and if you say anything negative about the game you will be blocked. Hope this review saves some of you some time so you can find a better game!",
        "What the hell kind of question is that?  \"Is it beautiful\".... meaning the game! HOW NOT PERTAINING TO ANY GAMES!  Anyway,  this game is hands down the best Slot game EVER!  Have played slots in and out of casino's for over 20 years and this is the one to play! A huge variety of Casino games,  easy to maneuver and a lot of really nice people.",
        "I used to love this game but something they did changed it. Winning is nearly impossible even if you are a paying customer. I know it is a game of luck but when you purchase 85 silver tickets you should be able to complete puzzles when you only need 1 piece for each of them. Make winning a little easier and people will be happy to spend money.  I think the game is broken. I was just playing in a room on Billionaire with a person who was playing on Huge Casino. I know it's the same developer but I don't think that is supposed to happen. I know the person was playing Huge Casino because it was my husband playing it. May want to look into it.",
        "Customer relations are horrible even non existent. If you spend money you will lose far more than you win, in their eyes you will spend even more. If you send a message they will hide behind a canned \"industry standard\" response. This is not a free standing casino there are no freebies and you can't collect any winnings. Yet they have their games dialed in so you lose in hopes you will spend money. Horrible company.",
        "I just started this account in hopes of recovering my lost one. If it goes smoothly, I am happy with the app to date. The slots don't pay as much as they used to, a little tite , otherwise a fun app. The events they choose for you to play, daily, do steal a lot of chips. If u want to remain in a successful club, you must do them, is the main downfall. I would recommend it to my friends.",
        "This is an interesting game. After I played it for awhile it became very boring. Haven't gotten a big or any good win for the past 70 million. I guess if you buy chips you might win more often. It doesn't give you all the bonuses, and it takes gifts and doesn't give them to the gamers you gave it to. So all in all it's just okay. I've never been able to get anywhere with their support team as they added to my reply. I'd give it a one star but if you buy chips it might be better."

        "I am ABSOLUTELY LOVING THE NEW GAMES!!! The free coins are very generous, but my only pet peeve is that I cannot seem to keep them very long. They go as fast as I win them! Also, the club coins could be a little higher. I send gifts to both friends and club members daily, but they're not enough to truly help anyone to continue to play.  But besides that, I just love DoubleU casino. I've been a member since practically the beginning and I will remain a faithful user! ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ",
        "This game is the biggest ripoff I have spent 100s of dollars of real money for nothing lost it all. Never get a Jackpot. A huge scam all they want is your money. No fun playing when you lose all the time really sucks would not recommend to anyone. I know you can't allways win but once in a while would be nice. Thanks for nothing Double U Casino.  Nicky",

        "great game! auto play is helpful for players who do not have a lot of free time in the real world. eats up battery like a fat kid at a buffet.   not worth downgrading a star but I noticed there is no audio mute option, just turn down volume bar as far to the left. So when you start the game app the first time, the intro audio blasts in your face! after you log into your account, game play is silent.",
        "It's been ok so far, I personally don't enjoy the auto feature but I get why it's there... I'm a busy person I have other stuff to do while I really want to game. Of course, the pay2play option is there otherwise you grind like ALL mmorpgs. Which I don't see the problem with... it's a free game ppl and a pretty decent one at that.",
        "Not only is it laggy, now after loading and installing the recent update, I can't even log in. After log in screen and after it checks for any update, it logs me out to main menu! This is ridiculous! After spending real money with this game you deny me access? So!ution required please asap.",
        "After update, not able to log in. Game crashes all before loging in. Either you fix it today, either i will demand for money return. I have payed money, not to be unable to log in. Do it today, or return money payed.  Since you have not attempted to fix the issue, i demand full refund for the purchases i made. Expect refund and reply! You HAVE to give any reply.",
        ".... Like the 100 or more people before me after the March 14th update I'm no longer able to log in for some unknown reason.. No info on the netmarble site about this issue which is odd.. I actually liked this game but this is really nad customer support.. Well time for a new time sink I guess..",
        "Game is a decent time waster. It's true that it is tedious if you're not willing to blow an inhuman amount of money. The recent update is causing the login screen to be unresponsive to my touch, and I cannot log on. Not terrible otherwise.. Samsung galaxy s8 active."

        "I like the game its fun and engaging but the premium choices cost a lot of diamonds and you don't get a lot opportunity to earn them. 12- 18 diamonds for more then a couple  choices in a story to make interesting choices that wouldmake the storys better but you only earn 1 diamond a chapter witch you have to wait an hour or more to unlock or buy keys.  So you pretty much have to spend real money for this game to really enjoy it. Ill be deleting this app not worth my time.",
        "While the game is enjoyable and the stories are intriguing, it is way too expensive to make certain choices. There is absolutely no need for choices to cost 20 or 25 diamonds when you only get 1 diamond for each chapter completed.  This game is in no way good enough to warrant spending real money on it, especially considering the ridiculously high prices of making certain choices which would require making a purchase in every single chapter.",
        "The game is great. Great graphics, nice music, perfectly cued entrees  for new characters, amazing story line.... But they don't give you enough keys or diamonds. I mean, y s its understandable that the chapters are long but 2hrs for a recharge on keys? Really? Either make the waiting time shorter, give us more, or both. Now as for the diamonds, they give you 25 of them. But each special choices is always way to much. And you never really know when your going to need them for something serious. With that said either give us more keys, lower the cost of the choice, or give us more diamonds per chapter. Not like 2 but 5 or more.",
        "It's a brilliant app, though sometimes I wish there wasn't as many gem choices. I fully considered buying gems until I realised how quickly they'd be used.   My favourite story was It Lives In The Woods, though most of the choices are gem choices. The story itself is fantastic, and I love the diversity of characters.   I had a problem with a story playing up and after a chat with the team was told to restart it. I didn't mind but I didn't get any keys to compensate what I'd already spent (I don't buy them I just wait for then to recharge, but it did mean I had to respend keys on one story because of a issue out of my control)   Overall its a great app and highly playable without spending.",
        "Diamond choices come up way too often for how much they cost and how little you get. The keys have an unreasonably long cooldown to get them. Options like watching ads to get diamonds would be a great option, especially seeings how you have that option in HSS and HU:RS. All that aside its a good game. Lots of the stories are enjoyable and its visually pleasing.",
        "Great graphics and great stories. Right now they have like 30 \"books\", so there are lots of options. I've been playing since 2016 and the app just keeps getting better. Can get a little pricey for the preminum choices, but otherwise it's a fantastic app; very additive and entertaining"

        "S***s, everybody having multiple account - if the admins ensure there is no cheating. yes, its a awesome game to play on and game got stuck on 11% after the update.. and still not working",
        "it could be a good game if you didn't have to spend cash for shields and teleports. They should be available in the alliance store . thats why the servers die. People get tired of rebuilding every time they sign on",
        "Lot of Server issues these days. Game servers are down for 30 Hours in last 4 Days. Many friends lost their Accounts and suffered Huge loss. But support team doesn't helps when you have lost everything. They ask for screenshot....hahaha!!!",
        "I just updated the game which fixes some minor bugs. But, Game stuck at 11% before updating & also after updating & it's become HABIT for me to see the Gameloft's March of empires: war of lord games SERVER PROBLEM. I am a Android mobile user, so, there must be a option of graphic quality change just to make sure that game runs smoothly, because I spend many months to grow & if big guys using PC version attacks, then I can't do anything because my game just freezes, lags & don't respond for some time. But the game is over for me as I loss so much. So, Gameloft launch a LITE VERSION FOR ANDROID USERS or there are huge chances of players who will leavethis game & already many left this game, as you can see the are many dead castles in each realm.",
        "Please upgrade to more realistic graphics and gameplay like Age of empires 3. Think more innovative like Fort camps to protect capitals and much more is needed in regard to spies, make it more difficult to spy and gather info. Also the defenses should be given more importance cause some guys from all realms have huge armies and it's easy for them to break into castles, I prefer more options when it comes to defenses. You guys are doing great but more options the better."

        "EA please keep improving, i already in love playing this game until i realized that i had to spend a lot amount of money to upgrade my team and collecting great cards.. actually im not feeling good at this because i'm not a rich guy that could paid all those packs with very high price.. im saying this to represent all f2p players out there, although im not so f2p at all. i only spent a dollar to buy that eoe pass and nothing again until now. so please, give a chance for f2p player to keep playing this game with no jealousy with those high overall p2p players.. thanks",
        "Be careful on this game, its possible to spend real money and get absolutely nothing in return! For example I bought a Saint Patrick pack, 1000 gems a pack and got 10 lucky leafs, I could use the lucky to buy another pack, which I got a lucky leafs from, so I spent 10 lucky leafs got 1 lucky leaf that I couldnt use  unless I brought more! Literally got nothing for my money. This is EAs way of mugging people.",
        "Please add more sounds effect on this game, and fix the sfx that already on this app. I hope you add full match online like the other game (90 minutes) so we just not attack but defends too. Replay button must be great, and i have idea that you guys add event like \"best goal of the week\" or so, from that replay, we can save, and send to you, and you can choose who will win it. I think it will make people playing this game. Commentator should be great too if you add full match versus online. I love this game, please read it. Egy Maulana V plays for Lechia Gda≈Ñsk now. Add it! Add to all of your fifa games. That replay button should be great",
        "I just saved up all my team hero points, watched a heap of ads so I could build up stamina so I could do my best to try to get Man√© in team heroes. About half way through collecting my hero rewards, the rewards pages started to go blank, and the last 25 packs I opened were empty. Is there any way to correct this?",
        "The game is good but it could be better. Elite players are too expensive  so it's hard to upgrade team. Informs and special cards are all untradable so unless you get lucky in events you won't get a chance to play with them. The new layout is better though. Unless you have plenty of time or money don't expect to progress in this game all that quickly. Mobile games should not be as grindy as console games.",
        "What's wrong with this game. I was playing Vs mode and was in world class level and got more then 600000 fans.and now I saw I'm in pro level.how it could be automaticy.fix it pls what the hell is going on.i make my progress playing v hard and all gone with in movement.even I did not play and lose."

So i uninstalled and reinstalled the game in my phone but there is no prompt that ask me if i wanna continue my progress when i play it again and it seems that im link to my google play (bacause there is no option to link it in the settings) but i still start back from the very beginning. And didn't really recovered my previous game. Love everything except for this.  P.S. i did the troubleshooting in the forum but nothing really helps.",
        "So after about a week of gameplay there are some things that I think can be improved upon. I understand this is not the computer version so automated actions are probably not going to be included. I feel like when I'm done using a product such as getting married, I should be able to return those items and get at least half my money back. I noticed that when I'm deleting items I'm not getting anything back and then item is completely gone.   This review won't be all negative though. I really like how you can meet different people from different countries, and chat with them via parties. I think the ducky bucks function sucks. And while I can understand the effort that was made when creating all these different tickets, I think it's just too much",
        "I've always been a fan of The Sims since it first came out on the PC and now this version is WAY BETTER than their other App game! I LOVE IT! It's so much fun and I can't wait to see what more is in store! UPDATE: After playing longer and being able to have a baby with my spouse, I found that our kids are labeled son and daughter under his family tree, but as father and niece under mine. That makes no sense! What's going on?!",
        "One of the best mobile games I have played. Not forced to buy anything with real money to keep playing, the cupcakes are great, I love everything. Right now, this is funner than Sims 4! My only complaint is that you can't change the story with another sim. I would love if once a story is complete, you could choose to pick another one. After all, relationships change over time in real life. Love this game!",
        "Sims is finally here on Mobile! I like how the Sims can complete events while you're not in the App. My only concerns are the limitations. It seems like with a lot of the actions my Sim is talking to herself or interacting with herself especially during the Hot Tub events. It would be nice to have them be able to interact with other Sims even while at work or at another event especially if rust are already friends or lovers with the other Sims! Also I think the careers and hobbies should have more variety. I also would like to be able to purchase a pool and build a patio.",
        "Great Game! Really captures that what made SIMS fun and for mobile on the go at that! Graphics are reasonable considering it is new. When building houses the only drawback is you cant construct walls within a room, you have to work with box rooms. As well as you cant make like a out door patio without it being in a room enclosure.  All in all though I do highly recommend this game to you if youve enjoyed SIMS games in the past. Loads to do,events and updates to keep you busy for awhile."

        "There is an abusive player on battlefield 62 and the developers have not been very responsive.  If you want to play a game where a player repeatedly tells others to kill themselves, douse themselves in gasoline, threatens people, makes sexual assault jokes and literally tells players with cancer he hopes they lose their battle and just harrasses players to make them quit and even says that is what he is doing then this is the game for you.  Edit:The developers reply shows another issue with the game.  If they read the part where I said the developers have not been very responsive they would realize I did contact GM support about this issue.  They just have not done anything.  Nothing has been done even though multiple players have contacted them.  This is why they have 1 star review.",
        "Was really looking forward to playing this game and it does have potential, but it's so frustrating with bugs that makes it so disappointing. Sort the bugs out and you'd have a great game.",
        "It's a good game overall. The in game support is minimal to non existent. Your better off asking players for support. Its a good team building game. Like every other game like this it's pay to win but with strategy and a good team you can still have fun. Again it's a good game. I just hope they sell to a smarter company with better skills in game development and customer service (because without customers, you don't have a game) and then this would be an even better game. Give it a shot just get a good active team and don't expect help from customer service. Be careful buying packs and if you do screenshot EVERYTHING. Hope this helps",
        "If army men strike stuck to there rules, and didn't allow people making death threats, abusive language, to play, it would be better, I would not let anyone under 21 play this game as the explicit content in chat would lead to children learning much foul language and receiving death and rape threats.  Ask anyone in bf 62",
        "So many glitches to what could be a great game....slow on fixes....no lvl buffer so watch out for maxed out players who love hitting low players...be sure not to come to bf74 as it has been held hostage by a single player called Welpia and his corps ROK.....YOU WILL BE MISERABLE.....numerous unanswered complaints to customer support by numerous players....numerous players. May rage quit on this bf....attempts to get cs to act have failed....other wise a great game with great potential so long as you dont get stuck in a bf with one who calls himself Welpia or any corsps. Named ROK or Kor",
        "This should be called Army Men Drama Field... This Game is a Joke along with the consultants you have a better chance of getting struck by lightning than getting a hold of anyone. And it's like being in pre school you can get banned for saying a bad word ü§£ i wouldnt waste my money or time on this game"

ALSO worth mentioning that a year of playing an i cannot reach max rank on 4 star. Dont mention the 5 star champions. It will take you prob 4 to 5 months of everyday grinding to fully rank a 5 star or even obtain a new one. All the steam aside.  A great game addicting to the  higher levels as you progress",
        "The game is very uncreative. Many of the characters have same moves even when they have different powers... I advice to increase some moves of the players which should be according to their powers otherwise good game.  And also the drop rate is bad, upto this point I have opened about 60 premium crystals and haven't got a single 3 star hero or higher.  .",
        "Pretty repetitive. swipe back, swipe forward, tap tap tap, hold, repeat. controls are rather monotone which I'll slighlty overlook because of the nature of the game but I see a lot of champions have the exact same moveset. also the drop rates are pretty bad. And on arenas, the opponents bcome a lot more powerful than my own. Other than that, good time killer",
        "If you want to invest a ridiculous amount of time to save shards you collect in game to supposedly increase your chances for too quality cards then get yourself either duplicates of what you already have or rubbish class characters in general. DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME WITH THIS GAME!",
        "I am addicted to this game. this game is awesome. But the people working in kabam are not good. They have blocked me from sending any messages. First of all I thought it was due to some bugs then I wrote a complaint to kabam. Lately they replied that        I have violated the rules. But I didn't do anything. If I really did anything wrong then they have to send me the proof. with out any proof and information they blocked me. You guys blocked me fine now send me the proof. Prove me that you really know your job. My name in the game is snsnns211187. Send me the proof. With out any proof you should not block me."

        "Best pool graphic wise but the game is not fair what so ever. Game is Controlled you don't decide if you win the game does. Your win percentage and rank don't mean squat. Cues length and force controlled to games advantage even when reloaded. I had 6,991,000 and my win percentage was 61.3 and lost 1 million 5x in a row. How do I have a 61.3% chance of winning and lose so easily by these 40-50% players like nothing. If you don't actually buy stuff with actual money on app game will treat you poorly.",
        "8 ball i have been playing it for sometime now and I spend alot of money on the specials.. great specials.. but I noticed whenever I buy coins I don't win any games until those coins are over and I'm only winning recently 2 games maximum in a row and normally my win streak used to be 7 and above... I don't know why this is happening but it sucks because it's putting me off the game.. it's like 8 ball is making sure I'm losing hence the rate 3",
        "Great 8 ball pool game. Plays great and looks great. 1 slight issue tho. Im from Ireland but i seem to be playing people from India and surrounding countries.   The Irish and Indian flag are kind of similar so im guessing thats where the issue is coming from.  I cant seem to edit my location either.

I was just about to win when i hit my solid ball and then last black ball was left but the ball goes in opponents hand said that you didn't hit your ball.. what was that? Can you please stop all these hacks and all for other users. There is no fair gameplay between each other.. please do some favourable to all users.  Hope you will take quick action in this manner Thanks.. Apoorv",
        "The game is very good. But that spin wheel is not fair at all. I've been playing this game for 6 years now (I know there used to be 1 coin reward there) and I've never got anything more than 2500 coin reward. My point is if you are keeping other rewards on that wheel atleast give equal probabilities for each reward. If not, just remove those big rewards and replace them with small ones but atleast with same probability for each of them. Hope you will do something. (P.S. i know it's a lucrative strategy developers play so that players will stick to the game. But you know just trying.‚úåÔ∏è)"

        "WARNING: IF YOU DO NOT CORRECTLY SELECT POWERS BEFORE APPROVING, YOU LOSE THE POWER(S) YOU SHOULD HAVE RECEIVED! ALSO, DO NOT USE YOUR CRYSTAL SKULLS TO POWER UP, USE THEM TO EVOLVE! If you like One Piece, you'll like this game. The One Piece story line is faithfully adapted to the plot of the game (not exact, but great for a game story line). The characters are great. If you are patient and power up your characters, you don't have to pay to play. Basically no advertisement,  except for self promotion of the game.",
        "Whether you are a fan of One Piece of not, this is an awesome game. Lots of fun, great and faithful art, and a rich combat. Best of all, they practically cram gems down your throat so you never feel forced to actually have to buy any.  An update to this is that I have been playing this game for years, so it is nice to see them keeping it fresh and fun. Still love this game. And as always, anni is the planni for my fellow Redditors.",
        "This game is so fun collecting all the characters and trying to evolve them. Over the years I've had multiple phones so the only downside is the saving of data I wish it would just be connected to your account like most other games in case you lose or break your phone. Rather than having to start over is they can fix that issue this game is one of the best on the app store.",
        "I have always loved onepeice and liked brave frontier very much so it's the best of both world's if you have ever beenm waiting for a one piece rpg then this is it. And grinding for items could of not been anymore fun than this. Still having fun with this game. And it's still getting better and better. Thank you for a perfect one-piece game. Also I normally hate grinding for items but when you live one piece like I do then it's doesn't matter. They also update the game with new content making it even better. 2018 and the game is still going strong.",
        "Good for a One Piece fan! The many aspects of the game makes it interesting. There can be a bit of a learning curve for new players, but the slight challenge is what makes it fun. The updates and changes keep the game from becoming dull as well. Btw I have fun playing even as a free player because they are pretty generous with the game currency. You just need patience as with any game you play for free.",
        "Game is fun overall. But get ready to grind after a week or so. Gems comes pretty easy overtime. But the prize in the store is a bit pricy especially when you are never guarantee the characters you want in the draw. So if you are not in a hurry. Save up your gems until they have a event with a guarantee 10th draw or something that has a character you want. Other than that, this game is great time killer and I love playing this game while waiting on the animation renew."

        "Great game. Everything you could want in a game. Castle building, PvP. Unique equipment with special stats. Different attack types, economy classes. Rewards are rewarding enough. So far 5/5. The theme is good. The balance seems reasonable. My only suggestion is making to character limit for name changes bigger for the dwellers/subjects. Only thing I can constructively suggest. Or be able to type first and last name.",
        "Love the concept of the game but the moment you start reaching higher castle lvl  that's when you realize that if you don't pay you will be on a long journey, ie.. PvP are out of the question everyone has minimum of 5 epic items, arena you will have to settle for 5th or less place due to power lvl difference. I am about 141000 fighting 190000 or 90000, which is not fair for those of low power or advantage to those of high.",
        "After playing for a few hours this I find this game good my only problem is that you need to pay for those epic drops? I mean in a game if you defeated the boss those are supposed to be yours without paying, I can accept paying for 1 dollar but the second boss requires me to purchase it for almost $3 I already paid for premium I don't want to pay for other things. Please make the drops free for premium members or have them cheap or totally free, or else after my premium I'll quit this game.",
        "I loved this game very much, I had a lot of really nice things and invested nearly $60 dollars into making my guys 5 stars and diamonds and other level up promos... I was the clan leader of the \"Bananna Kings\" my main complaint is my phone rebooted and now I've lost everything... my game, my victories, my clan, and all the money I invested in this great game... please help. ;( my username on my good account is \"Skylark\"",
        "Loved playing the game, I just wish there was a balance in the PvP Tournaments, can't find a tournament where everyone else isn't 20000 Points over my guys. Please fix this!! Just put a bloody +/-5000 points deviation on it! Make it more enjoyable for people who don't buy everything they see",
        "best game on mobile i think. just make sure your account is linked to your facebook and google play so you dont ever lose your account i almost lost everything when my phone broke. luckly i got it to turn on for a bit before going off and linked my accounts. now im fine.."

        "This game is very hanging my mobile another games are good  speed but this game is  no speed  improve this game",
        "Dear team, It's really a awesome game ever. I'm playing it since 2 years. Very addictive. But i request you to all, when we start a TEAM RACE many players join clans for playing team race n take efforts in team race for getting better reward but many of them team leaders kick players just before ending the team race n players won't receieve any reward for it. It was happened with me 2 times. So please do any update for those players who take much efforts in team war and then also they get nothing. Thanks",
        "This game used to be 5 star. They've changed it where all team events are gem sucks. You have no chance of winning without using a considerable amount of gems. They've taken away most in game free ways to get gems, and to buy them is not worth it, they're very over priced. It's not a team event, it's a paid for event. If they change it and make it more fair for everyone I'll make a new rating.",
        "It's a nice game with so many awesome monsters. I like it and it's my favourite game in this category. My suggestion is that if you can include an option to cancel ongoing breeding by giving gold or gems or without anything, it would have been better. The game has events that comes very frequently, it helps so much in getting new monsters and or progressing in the game.",
        "The game is awesome! The game play, the monsters, and also the actual fighting and graphics. This is one of my most rated games and my most played; I couldn't go a day without it. It's competition is so good online with people and in dungeons and the map, also team wars are fun with your friends. Get this game you'll never regret it.",
        "DO NOT PAY FOR ANYTHING IN THIS GAME. Recently my account was reset due to the game posting the wrong price of gems. I have lost everything even the things I paid full price for. I have been robbed of gems, cells, gold, food and my time. If you do play the game, don't spend actual money because they can take it all away. BE CAREFUL"

The controls are great and graphics a+. (they also keep adding new fun stuff that makes the game fun to play for even experienced players) great game üòÄ",

I can't build most of what I'm able because I'm still trying to gather from the first levels.  I die instantly at every aggressive player I encounter.  Maybe there is a trick to finding my stuff that I don't know.",

If you can't restore your progress and continue playing without restoring, then all your progress is lost!",

It gives you money and helps us in-game. Please add faster energy recharge and unlimited ads. Because taking away ads is a little much..",

Who the hell cares about a dog when you can't even keep a jacket for more than a trip to a location... Update has lost my account again and do you know... I think that I have had enough. I'll come back if you do ever finally release it which I don't think you will until you stop wasting time on pointless additions and concentrate on the core gameplay.sort yourselves out, I am going to find another game.",

I've been a loyal player from the very beginning and that's their response. I'll post a message on Facebook everyday and see how many people keep playing your game or even start playing it. lol. isn't it funny how they only have gameplay graphics and controls that you can see the rating for and not how happy users are. download war z law of survival. that game is much better and the developers actually listen to the people playing."

I'll give 5 stars if 5 theres improvement. Thanks!",

The only reason this game has so many player is the game size & device compatibility. If your phone is capable of playing \"the famous 3v3 moba\", you'd better play that game",
        "This game is so cool. Only noob will say it hard to play or hard getting hero/skin. Maintain the gameplay and everything will be alright. Sometimes we win and sometime we won't. Only the graphics need to be improve. Come on! It's 2018 already! Make a tournament cause i wanna join!!. (Give me free skin. I give u  5 stars bitchhhhhhhh)",

        "I love this game, I've been playing this for over a year and I still play it daily! All the skins and heroes skills are amazing. But please don't  let me team up with low level players it's affecting my game and stats when I'm trying my best to carry they would just afk which can be frustrating. But overall it's a good game",
        "I hv been playing this game for two years alll good perfect game perfect graphics..bt there should be some changes for the afk players... strict steps should be taken towards for these afk players not bye lowering credit score by banning from game for a period of time so that they won't be spoiling game any further"

    "descriptionHTML" : "Join your friends in a brand new 5v5 MOBA showdown against real human opponents, Mobile Legends: Bang Bang! Choose your  favorite heroes and build the perfect team with your comrades-in-arms! 10-second matchmaking, 10-minute battles. Laning, jungling, tower rushing, team battles, all the fun of PC MOBAs and action games in the palm of your hand! Feed your eSports spirit!<br><br>Mobile Legends: Bang Bang, 2017&#x2019;s brand new mobile eSports masterpiece. Shatter your opponents with the touch of your finger and claim the crown of strongest Challenger!<br><br>Your phone thirsts for battle!<br><br><b>Features:</b> <br><br><b>1. Classic MOBA Maps, 5v5 Battles</b> <br>Real-time 5v5 battles against real opponents. Fight over 3 lanes to take the enemy&#x2019;s tower. 4 jungle areas. 18 defense towers. 2 Wild Bosses. Complete reproductions of classic MOBA maps. Full-on 5v5, Human vs. Human battles. A triumphant return to genuine MOBA gameplay.<br><br><b>2. Win with Teamwork &amp; Strategy</b> <br>Block damage, control the enemy, and heal teammates! Choose from Tanks, Mages, Marksmen, Assassins, Supports, etc. to anchor your team or be match MVP! New heroes are constantly being released!<br><br><b>3. Fair Fights, Carry Your Team to Victory</b> <br>Just like classic MOBAs, there is no hero training or paying for stats. Winners and losers are decided based on skill and ability on this fair and balanced platform for competitive gaming. Play to Win, not Pay to Win.<br><br><b>4. Simple Controls, Easy to Master</b> <br>With a virtual joystick on the left and skill buttons on the right, 2 fingers are all you need to become a master! Autolock and target sifting allow you to last hit to your heart&#x2019;s content. Never miss! And a convenient tap-to-equip system lets you focus on the thrill of battle!<br><br><b>5. 10 Second Matchmaking, 10 Minute Matches</b> <br>Matchmaking only takes 10 seconds, and battles last 10 minutes, glossing over the quiet early-game leveling up and jumping right into intense battles. Less boring waiting and repetitive farming, and more thrilling action and fist-pumping victories. At any place, at any moment, just pick up your phone, fire up the game, and immerse yourself in heart-pounding MOBA competition.<br><br><b>6. Smart Offline AI Assistance</b> <br>In most MOBAs, a dropped connection means hanging your team out to dry, but with Mobile Legends: Bang Bang&#x2019;s powerful reconnection system, if you get dropped, you can be back in the battle in seconds. And while you&#x2019;re offline, your character will be controlled by our AI system to avoid a 5-on-4 situation.<br><br>PLEASE NOTE!

AND THEN WHEN THE NEW UPDATE COMES OUT.... I LOSE IT ALL!!!!!!!!!!!!! Can you PLEASE give me the stuff back.",

I don't know if I were think too much but I feel like Everytime I level up, the weapon that I use before was unexpectedly weaker.Lucky chest seem to drop only coins and crysrals(sometimes I got free spin). And some modes, weapons and armor balance is not really that balance (example:last match I used smart bullet bazooka to kill people using 4 rockets to kill them. But he killed me with only 2 rockets of smart bullet bazooka...... How is that even balance?!). I hope you fix this soon. Because I love to play game.",

Although you have many in app purchases available you can play without spending any real money and be competitive. The developers award you with more than enough items on a daily basis. It's definitely a must have for fans of this game type.",
        "I'm sure this is a fun game, however I do not see the reason why it needs to have permission to manage my phone calls or know my location if I never plan to use any online abilities. That is just too much access to my phone. I did not even get a chance to play the game because it wanted that access on start up; it will not allow you to play the game without give permission.",
        "It's a great strategic game. PvP is more event driven rather than a free for all.Great value for the money you spend whether it's a little or a lot...and the purchases give a little free to your team. Lots of ways to win free stuff and points you can spend on items needed in alliance store and keep up with your wallet warrior team mate. One downside is the support..they can be a little sliw in response time to problems. But they don't just ignore you either.",
        "Why does this app request access to make calls/read sms/messages? Un-installed right away.  Edit: That's not how it works. Just because you say \"your phone is safe\" doesn't make it safe. You're still getting the permission from un-educated users that you can read their messages. That's very shady.",

I lost 50% of my troops in my main castle which went missing, lost 1 m of power, my farms was plundered and troops in my farms was massacred. Reported the issue but they ROK did not bother to give me a courtesy reply so if you decide to play but sure the system does not steal your time and effort playing the game.

You lose coins fast like the real slots, unfortunately. I just start playing the game for the first time and I'm already out of coins. I believe they start you off with a low amount because I'm already out of coins in 30mins of play. The games and the graphics are fun though, which makes it attractive to play. My only complaint is paying for those coins..",
        "The variety of games are great, and I would enjoy playing them if I didn't lose all my money within 30sec... It's totally ridiculous to only get $800 every couple of hrs when the cost to spin one time is $250! Also, the big spin wheel sucks too... Instead of the normal $800, I get close to $2000. Big woop. Give more $ or make the spins less!",
        "If you like slots this app is great. Gives free chips/credits every 4 hours but for more free chips you have to go on the HOF Facebook page in order to participate in their daily contests plus click on links to collect more free chips. Sometimes I collect chips for a few days without playing in order to save up a larger bank so when I do play Im able to raise my bet & win more. But if u bet too much per spin (based on ur total chip bank) you will loose 99% of the time.  Wish I cd Win more contests!",
        "Short reviews are tough as any gambling game if ya win it's fun & great. If you lose it sucks! Cash purchases of chips & extras disappear super fast! The 3 hr wait to collect a few coins is very long. Then the SPIN has not given me a BIG pay out ever & I've been at x 2.0 forever. I hope you listen to your patrons & investigate & consider meeting our concerns at least some of the way. We know you make TONS money also! Consider smaller costs on packages if your not going to ever let us win! Tyvm"

Many videos crash the game, which means you lose the treat you would otherwise earn by watching those ads. Other crashing problems as well.",
        "For not getting even the first event bird out of 3 in alien excavation after opening so many premium eggs reaching (*4) of the premium eggs. I blame - chimera and rovio. Either the makers of the game are idiots or the game is stupid and seriously 2000 per month for an imaginary egg everyday that cannot guarantee a 4 or 5 star bird. Yeah, the makers of the game really are idiots.",
        "the game is really fun and humorous. I love the clan feature- found a great clan to be part of. there are glitches that rovio needs to iron out that affect play. I am hoping this new big update helps fix all that. the changes look to be really good. excited to see what they've done.",
        "I did not expect to enjoy this nearly as much as I have. The frequent events are nice and having a guild just makes them better. I don't feel compelled to be social be because there is no chat, just playing the game. It is a wonderful balance.",
        "Love the game. The game play is great. Only down side is that I feel that the game cheats against me sometimes by adding enemies. Only happened about 3 times now. ***edit*** I have since realized there are certain pigs that do add more pigs when hit. The game doesn't cheat. I'm extremely happy with the game play and ability to build a great team without paying a whole bunch of money. You just need patients and good planning.",
        "Decent game, lots of fun to keep you coming back. I would of rated a 4 star game but every time I need to watch a video the game stops working, stopping me from getting a free premium egg or opening chests!"

Ill update as I see other menus broken.",

I always get thee same armament with only one star!  and some items are soo expensive that the money you pay is not worthy for the br you get and in return you'll get low br and also low money not worthy.. If they make this game less expensive maybe I'll give it a four stars... But no! not this time",

Funny how I pay money and now I have Chinese characters all over the damn game...  THIS is absolutely a pay to play game...except when you pay...the game apparently stops working....",

        "Don't spend a dime if you play this game.  Rates on character drops are rigged.  As you go up in rank they manipulate drop rates as they believe people who invest so much time will pay money to try and get better rather than quit.  This is a major issue.  You cannot do any real events without banner cards and the developers know this.  Again they manipulate rates based on account rank so as you go up in rank your chances go way way down.",
        "Updates keep getting stuck with the ver 3.8.1. Since it was released. Download 269 out of 269 but nothing happens after that, and a message of \"connection error\" keeps appearing. Have passed the daily log in bonus, and will probably lose the consecutive login bonuses as a result. Didn't create transfer code or link to fb account yet so may risk of losing account if I reinstall. Please fix this asap.",
        "This game is awesome however, today I was updating my app and I can't log in. It updated and say open than the app continues to try and update and wont. I can't even transfers it. I tried with internet and my data. I have more than enough storage but now all my time and effort has been wasted. And I feel \"great\"",
        "Tried transferring to new device, now the damn game won't download beyond the title screen and I've tried everything to get it to work. A pity too. I liked the game but I can't play it. All that time spent on my old phone, just gone.",
        "As promised I upped my 3 star to a 4 star because SSJ4 Gogeta is complete now. However it really kills the joy of the game to have to gather 5 of the same SSR to awaken all the way especially when I used some of them for super attack power increases. Find another way to fully unlock characters through the potential grid(maybe a tournament item) and you'll pull me back from Pokemon Duel.",
        "This gacha game involves summoning characters through a \"loot box\" system.  Most games now show rates so you know what you are getting in to.  For this game, however, it do not show the rates on this english version.  For now, just keep this in mind if you decide to spend money on this game.  Until this issue is fixed and until Google Play policies are updated to reflect showing rates in \"loot box\" based games, my review will remain as 1-star"

Apparently according to IA it wasn't my day. Like I said before, game is pre programmed. Dev's do nothing about the gameplay, they rather concentrate on silly add ons which can make them money. Big boooooooooo for dev's.",
        "In overall it's a good game but needs some changes.  The match engine is not so good .  Like promotion to next division , also should be a relegated team from that division to a lower division.  Prices are outstanding. Tokens are a problem.  But i insist AGAƒ∞N that SYSTEM Dƒ∞Vƒ∞Sƒ∞ON needs a new update or review. PUT AT LEAST A TEAM THAT SHOULD GET RELEGATED TO A LOWER Dƒ∞Vƒ∞Sƒ∞ON.  The idea that you have to change the whole team every season is also not a good thing. Some little changes are needed to make this game a wonderful game.",
        "I think it is the BEST FOOTBALL MANAGING game i have ever played.  But you should make some changes,like as tikitaka,counter attack,long ball  ext. These will be helpful for us.we need more tactis. Thank yiu for your wonderful game.",
        "I am playing the game for 1year now and I think you have to increase the percentage of the players when they rest for 3hrs... I think 6% is not enough specially when we have 2 games per day (league and cup or champions league), because after the game, they still have to have two training sessions and they get too tired, with no time to recover at least 50 of condition for the next match, so from ther we have no manage well by leadind \"easy sesseions\" and player do not develop as they should. For me the time of recovery is fine, but the points conceived are to low... at least 10% in each 3hrs. Hope you get my point. The app is üëå I love it",
        "Worst game ever every update just gives more problems and the current problems we message these idiots about are never resolved...infact they don't even reply.. they are only about the money now.. ive gave 6 years to these losers and this is how I am repaid.. disgusting is an understatement.. avoid games made by these rude ignoramuses at all costs",
        "I think u guys should find a way for us(we the managers) to get tokens easier . I don't understand why winning the league or champions league only gets you money but no tokens . it really sucks"

        "Repetitive game that requires a lot of thinking. Quite addictive as I've been playing for nearly year and half now. I didn't spend a penny on game but quite a lot of time. Its very difficult to be very good without spending real cash but it's possible. You can watch adverts for coins, so be patient and play. The more you play the more you get. You don't need top characters to have great team - you can create great team with average characters if you focus on weapons. Get yourself into a good team, hit faction's minimums and you'll become great.",
        "There are good and bad aspects of this game, but the pros out weigh the cons. You can absolutely level up incredibly high without spending a single penny on this game. You just need patience. One of the funniest aspects of this game is its long term playability. There is always something to do every day and in the long run it all adds up to your benefit.  My only complaint is the pop up windows when you first get on. They show you you've been raided...then you have the notification that you have to check that gives you the same info. If the pop up already gives me the info, why do I still have notifications?",
        "Rubbish repetitive game. After spending ten's of thousands pointlessly I can tell you honestly... don't waste your time or money. It's a very addictive cash cow and just a very smart way to take your money and keep you hooked. Scopely has repeatedly lied and will continue to do so. You have been warned",
        "Ive been playing this for 2 years, love it but support is well below standard. I have a problem just now where it crashes every 5 mins and support do nothing. Its become unplayable. Avoid if you have a samsung device",
        "The game has slowly been turning more p2w than ever before. Before 6 stars had come into play, you could easily get any 5 stars. Even some p2w toons were able to be accessed later on in some events. With 6 stars, this really isn't the case. This has also caused the Road to Survival community to become more toxic and started making the game unfair/not fun for other players.",
        "I like the strategy involved in playing the game. The only thing I think I would change is when you kill an enemy and he comes back to life,  they should come back as a zombie. .not keep all their ability before death. .otherwise it keeps you interested."

Because we have to waiting for it to be downloaded before can play again. Can we choose to update whenever we want?  Anyway, this is a really nice game and I've been playing it for a long time. Keep up the good work!",
        "I love the game. There's nothing wrong with it because I feel like it's the old game that I grew up with. But what I hate is that the prices for packs, lp, sp and simoleons went high. The prices before was okay but now I don't think I will spend anymore for packs that give only like 5vip points. Such a fun game but aimes for large microtransactions.",
        "I really enjoy this game, and love developing my Sim's homes and the world. Unfortunately, my game won't open. It hasn't for about a month now, even after this new update. It shows me the loading screen for five minutes, then crashes. It would be wonderful if there could be a fix for this.",
        "Love love love it! This game is actually better than The Sims Mobile... 2 problems,, 1st. The Modern houses with second floor, so expensiveüò≠! 2nd. The time it sometimes takes ages just for one activity!üòê but hey, everything else.. TOTALY AWSOME! üòç thanks so much for creating this game. Cuz its so hard to download the sims 4 in a Mobile. üíï",
        "This is actually cool and I really love this game. However, the expiration of most of the quest that i'm having are only 2 days to finish. I think it's unfair, and the materials needed are too expensive. Sims are busy on finishing tasks so they won't be able to go to work and earn. So I'm not totally enjoying the game.",
        "When you get an event sometimes it only lasts for like 2 days which really isn't enough because some actions take 1 day. Please extend event times and don't give like 5 events at the same time. Also you should be able to log in other ways apart from Facebook because lots of people don't have Facebook. Please make other ways for us to login  so we can get more neighbours."

        "I am only giving ABF a 3 right now. I have played ABF since the beginning of it's time. I feel as if the coin rewards are very slim in the higher leagues. I am a Diamond Star 4 and I feel as if the higher the level the higher the reward but, the rewards are all the same. When you work your way up you want to feel rewarded! If coin rewards increase in the higher levels so will my rating!!!!!",
        "I would give it 5 stars, but they've changed a few things. It's now more difficult to earn coins for power-ups. So in order to win the tournaments, they've put people in the position of having to make purchases more often. Needless to say, I don't play as often anymore. I've also noticed that several of my friends don't play anymore either. Too bad, the game used to be a lot more fun.",
        "Been playing this game for years. Loved it in the beginning.  Seems the lower I rate the game as they try to make easier for people that are not good.  the birds I throw are nearly useless a lot of times compared to playing the same game for a star 2 player I know. And now the game is crashing constantly. Wish I could sell the nearly 100,000 bird coins I have. Seems I won't need them.",
        "Ok so when there is an issue that needs addressed, sometimes it take a couple of days for the tech people to get to it. But overall the game is awesome! This is the only game that I still play every day from the time I got a smart phone, which has been several years!",
        "I love playing angry birds friends. I'm an adult woman and have played since they came out with the game. Scoring in first place many times. Recently there seems to be too much graphics and sometimes using plays from other games or other angry birds games. If people are submitting what they have thought out, please make sure it stays within original angry birds friends game. Some levels are too far out there.",
        "I loved this game to keep in touch with a few friends but please take those stupid Dignity ads off... They do not close and always end up missing up my game. I have to close the game out and start all over. Loosing many power ups and coins in this tedius game making it more frustrating than fun."

Would keep people playing more and they would have more purchases! That's how I'd rack in the bucks if it were my app!",
        "2ND UPDATE: 3/21/18- Thank you for adding new bathrooms and bathroom rugs! Thank you also for giving new, unique furniture on 5th or 7th consecutive days. Great job, and ty for  listening to players and making more  levels and changes and continued updating!  UPDATE: 2/2018 Please make more optional designs to find at neighbors' homes. I've been searching, and I can't find any more. Especially for the bathroom, and for the garden/flowers. That is one of the best features of the game. ty!         Thank you for the new update and new expansion!  Cant wait to achieve the new rooms. Best game!  Much better than \"Scapes\" Games. I like the way you can travel to neighbors to get new interior design fashions! A new idea that is brilliant. I am spoiled now! LoL Thank you and please keep up the hard work!",
        "Good game. Fun so far. I enjoy renovating the first room and the master bedroom.  So far I have only one complaint. Why can't I get the master bedroom? While I'm all for being generous, generosity has its limits and it is MY house. It might seem small to some but it does irritate me as I do love the story as one of the best bits. I'm not the only one who doesn't like her just claiming for herself. It comes across as rather arrogant and presumptuous of her. An idea might be to give me the master bedroom and then give her another where you can design it more to her tastes as a decorator.  Apart from that story issue just keep on going.",
        "Getting a little frustrated with this. I play on both my phone and tablet. When I try to play on my phone it asks me to update to synchronize my progress yet there are no updates available.  I have switched off and on and even uninstalled and reinstalled.  Very annoying that I cannot now play on my phone.  Just reinstalled this and it is working great now. Thank you for sorting. 5 stars all round.",
        "I am obsessed with this game! Love that you can easily make friends with other real players and use their furniture! Mixed levels of difficulty which means you never get stuck on a board for an annoying amount of time. Only thing is that when choosing your furniture, you have to click the picture a bunch of times before it let's you preview it.",
        "I like this game but it's frustrating how it's hard to get stars and then they want you to waste them on things like giving the cat a bath... I want to decorate the house not do all the silly side things."

Unfortunately, i have one issue i can't access the chat room, no messages, cant access mh own profile. It keeps saying network error even though i am currently playing the game smoothly. If you can fix this i would gladly appreciate",

The shop is sucks. Too much chines character. I dont know my goal at all. Etc.. So many issue for this game needs lot's of improvement.",

Not the first time I have ran into this problem.  Please help me fix this.  I have cleared the game data uninstalled and all that nonsense.",

I have been trying to reach AoC support for almost a week about recovering my account.

        "This slot app is one of th best. Many fun and and friendly people. The staff  are helpful  if you have any questions. I really enjoying playing most of the slots. Some of my favorites are in the  classic section. I have been playing for several years. Today I am upset because of deleted chips, went from 1.2m won 690k but they did a minus instead of add. Grrrrrr  üòä Today my chips are multiplied, I'm doing great. It's a fun game.",
        "The thrill of the game I once loved is gone. Games just eats chips so you can purchase more and then eats them too! Games have low wins and keeps your play money low also. I only have it because of my BF Friends and I have money invested in it. BF don't seem to care that the luster is gone from a lot of their players or even care to bring it back!  üòïüòïüòïüòï Still hoping for the best though!",

        "I'm addicted to Big Fish and I keep  coming back for more!  No matter how many other casinos I've tried, Big Fish is right up there at the top!!!  The graphics are good,  the bonuses are good and the tier rewards are the best!!  The social aspects are really good plus you get rewards for/and from friends.  The only thing I would change is the ability to give gold.",
        "BIG FISH CASINO IS NOTHING BUT A GREEDY RIGGED SCAM COMPANY THAT PREYS ON PEOPLE. THEY TRY TO GET PEOPLE HOOKED SO THEY CAN SPEND THEIR HARD EARNED MONEY. BFC ONLY CARES ABOUT TAKING MONEY FROM PEOPLE WHILE RIGGING THE SYSTEM AMONGST OTHER UNETHICAL BEHAVIOR. GOOGLE PLAY SHOULD BAN THIS SCAM APP."

I would have been excited about the upcoming birthday event if I could access my game. Fix soon or I will delete this and all other zynga games I funnel my hard working money into",
        "Great game, love achieving all the quests, also love the show animals, I wish I could do more than one with a partner though. I wish that during an update that it wouldn't stop the game for the players, showing grassy area with no coins or keys and level 1, so I could continue to play. But I know I just have to leave it for a while and wait till the update is finished, which is hard because it is so addictive. Some people need to remember though that this is a free game.",
        "Liked this game until now. I recieved some keys from the game. I used them then they said they had had some technical difficulties and some players should not have received them then promptly took my remaining keys off me!  This was they're mistake not mine. I find this churlish and ridiculous. It's put me right off the game!",
        "Since Jan this game has gone to hell in a hand basket. Every update I have to fight to get stuff back they y'all took from my game. This game use to be fun, now I don't care if I play it or not. Y'all only care a out the people who spend money on your game, not the loyal ones that's been playing since it went mobile. I'm very disappointed!!",
        "I just started playing this game and was really liking it. In one day I made it to level 15 and had made a purchase using real money. The app froze and I tried everything is fix it but it erased my whole farm and made me start over. I am soooooo mad!!!! And I'm mad I spent money and lost everything. Really not impressed at all",
        "When I first got it it worked fine. (Yesterday). Now every time I get on it'll load but will freeze and not let me do ANYTHING AT ALL. I've tried everything from closing the app to restarting my phone. Please fix it because I really like the game."

        "Not a bad game but it's typical like some other games. It starts off with the levels being super easy, letting you build your confidence to get you thinking you're really good.  Now I understand the higher the levels the more difficulty there is but not to the point where they make it almost impossible trying to get you to buy more chances. Another words they're trying to get you to pay to win and advance not necessarily on skill level. Very sneaky. Uninstalling. It's fun for a while but overall I do not recommend.",

Still having the problem of when having to reinstall I lose all my lives and charms. Love the game but hate ,owing all my lives and charms",

        "The update took me from level 400 back to level 1 very upset be first I wasn't getting my daily play rewards so I figured like everything else it may need to update and the update blow my whole progress. I'm so pissed is there a way to fix this?",
        "I actually enjoyed the game and would give it four or five stars except 200 coins and multiple items were taking away simply because I got logged out if Facebook. Also several levels were lost.... This I understand, glitches happen. What I don't understand and don't accept is the lack of response from the developer. I've sent several emails and have yet to get a non automated response.",

        "Overall game is very good n addictive, been playing the game for awhile now. 1 major issue of the game is bugs that cause the game to lag esspecially after every game update. Reali hope Pocket Gems will look into this matter seriously and build a better game foundation. I will review my ratings when the game is more stable.",
        "LOVE THIS GAME!! unlike other timed games you don't have to wait around.  When things are upgrading you can literally spend hours if you want just attacking other bases and breeding dragons.  Graphics are amazing and this is one game that constantly has me coming back.",
        "Wonderful game, all these pay to win comments are slightly misleading. There are several power ups and time reducers that come fairly easy if you participate in events. Which, the events are almost always going on so you don't get bored!  Only problem I have is that the app keeps uninstalling itself from my phone. Not sure if it's the app's fault or my phone, but it doesn't happen to any other app on my phone...",
        "PG needs to fix a lot of stuff. They never listen to the community and with the Atlas update has destroyed many alliances by creating a class divide between teams of all ranks. Huge let down and am afraid of the future of the game when game design decisions like this are allowed to occur.",
        "Fun until you have to wait a day to do something. How can you play a game if the game won't let you play, but by good it takes up space. So you want me to have a game taking up space in my phone but I'm can't play the game. So it is literally a waste of space.. developers are stupid and selfish."

Big advantage.. And you dont HAVE to go platinum to enjoy this game, but I am considering it ! GREAT JOB !!",

        "I really hated this game at first, when i was trying it on a friend's phone. It has really grown on me since then, i love it. I've been playing it for years now and still love it; the graphics are amazing, the game play is smooth, my clan is great, there's always new stuff to do or new bots/weapons to acquire. Yes, there are some people playing that kinda ruin a battle for your team but Hey, it's just a game and you still get points if you lose. Do your best and have fun.",
        "Great start! No glitches. Performs smoothly! One of the best games on Android!! Must download Belive me I have never spent a single penny of \"real\" money and the game has never been unfair to me. Its really very good game. They found a sweet spot to balance both paid and free players. You just need to go on playing. I got the costliest robot of the market for free. Keep playing you'll eventually be strong enough and then you'll never stop to play.",
        "After being so long on the game I can see that the development team behind this game is pretty committed. I can see they really put effort into debugging, improving and renewing some elements of the game, I've decided to increase the star counts for War Robots (This is the original one). It's one heck of a game for mobile device I can tell you that. As for attaining the \"best robots\" or the \"best weapons\" in the game, it's hard but it's not impossible.  Just take part in the festive events... and you don't neccessarily need the \"best bots\" to annihilate your opponents...",
        "This game is very much Pay to Win. So expect some people to crush you.  All the \"gambling\" games are fixed to make sure you get the lowest possible reward. Don't waste your gold gambling. All that said this game is worth 5 stars just for the gameplay. The graphics are amazing and the game is fun even when you end up against someone spending hundreds of real dollars on robots and gear. Be patient. You may not always win or do well but in time you can give all but the most hardcore spenders a run for their money (all pun intended)",
        "It will be cool if we can upgrade not  just one robot but all!! And pls double the gold I rlly need it right now for just 1 orkan And also why is it so hard to get a weapons like with puzzle logo on it it's like 10,000 can you imagine that! If I made the game I would do just 6,000 or 5,000! One more make a single player like player vs AI and it will say easy medium hard",
        "Fun for a little bit of time killing. I really enjoyed the gameplay and Graphics. However don't bother playing this game unless you are going to spend money on it. You quickly realize that everything you need to buy to upgrade your robot cost money or some other in-game currency that you have to spend money in order to get"

EDIT: still no real task force improvements, why it doesn't open straight onto you TF or why I have to go through several buttons to see people starts is stupid. sorting this out make my review 5*",
        "This is not another Clash of Clans clone, but definitely pushes the boundaries of the clan genre. Good graphics, fun gameplay, and balanced in terms of units vs. defences for your island. While diamonds can be purchased by real-world money, the game doesn't trap you into needing them. The weekly mini-game missions help keep things fresh and assist in moving your base up the tech tree if you're patient. SuperCell is continually expanding the game to keep it interesting. Definitely worth a download!",
        "Very addictive and always checking on my base, upgrades etc. Strategic game play, however too much pressure to buy diamonds as it takes FOREVER! !! for some things to upgrade. Seriously. ..2 days for an upgrade??? Only other issue is the limited time \"special abilities\"...they're fun but it makes it far too easy for someone to raid your base and take all resources needed to get the upgrades. Lots of fun and love the graphics",
        "The graphics are amazing for this type of game. And I think that's why so many people love it. The only thing I wish that their could be is offline play. Just block the chats and player raids and only allow campaign attacks and their would be many more players able to play... Bcs sometimes I don't have data or wifi where I am and it's a pain bcs I love Supercell games. And ik why there isn't offline play, bcs the other players that attack you. But their must be some way around that like maybe a whole offline mode. Well if u read this ty and it's a great game keep up the amazing work you do providing us with amazing games...  ~Bladez",
        "I have played this game since it has come out and I have seen all of the changes and they have shaped that game for better over the years the game has been out it has improved and is one of my best games I have ever played. But the down side is that it is really hard to get resources at first but then before you know it you are full and you have nothing to do about it. Also when getting the heros they should make that base a bit easier because the lower level people can't attack till the have a lot better troops.",
        "Great game, but too slow. While I love the lack of pay to win, I'd wish for a way to speed up resource gathering: I've cleared out every similar level player in my area, and spend days waiting for RSS to build up so I can upgrade. Which is necessary before I can access a larger zone. No point buying speedup gems, as I've never anything to use them on!"

        "All in all a fun game which u dont have to pay for.. on lvl 104 now and still enjoying the game and actually progressing too.. thumbs up from me! Update: dropped down to 3* after update. Totally been made to p2w now by adding stupid fusion medals.. was a hrund before but now almost unplayable.. greed have ruined the game for me and will probably uninstall.. many others also when u go in chat room.. not good epic summoners, not good at all.. good game ruined again :(",
        "Latest update with fusion medals ruined the game. Got stuck like many other players. Fusing was hard enough without them (ie collecting 4 same 4 star heroes plus 4 same 3 star, PLUS random 4 star heroes... Ridiculous) to get 5 star one, now you stuck waiting to lvl up your current ones to pass stage boss and MAYBE get fusion medals... Ruined very good game.",
        "What the hell are you people thinking,.  Fusion Medals are the most ridiculous thing to add to the game.   It was bad enough the game cost so much to play, but then you really screw us over good with Fusion medals.   Crooks,. You guys should be in jail. Class action law suit.  Horrible,.   Don't play this game, waste of your time and big money.",
        "They absolutely ruined this game with the last 2 updates! Be prepared to spend a fortune to be competitive! They took away the best parts of the Game! Added another item you need to make heroes that are very difficult to get! Then they reduced the number of dark soul you get when disassembling heroes! I'm a paying customer, don't mind supporting development but not when you feel taken advantage of! Don't recommend this game! Very Very Greedy company! Planners should Be Fired!",
        "New updates have killed game experience.  Now not only do you have to wait to gain xp for adventure levels,  you are now limited on fusing characters.  Lack of ability to gain fusion medals limits game play. Very few other actions log in and play 10 minutes a day and then nothing to do for another whole day.  No ability to move at your own pace.  Everything is limited.  To those that can endure slow pace only way to gain in game is slowly over time with daily log ins."

This is actually better than their console games. Well recent carbon and most wanted are amazing. The newest are hot garbage. This one is fun.reallywish there was free roam or a sand box room where you can admire and test drive  what you have grinded out so many hours to get. Only bad thing. Also the boxes are too expensive leaving having to grind way too much just for absolutely anything. By the time you get anything good this game servers will be empty.",
        "Thank you for making this awesome game, I love it! I've not had this much fun playing a Need For Speed game in years.. Update 2.9.1 is fantastic. Although after updating, I'm having trouble connecting to the game servers... :/ Hope it gets sorted soon! nevertheless, I look forward to future updates. ;)",
        "It's a great game, graphics are ok, smooth playing. But. There are some ideeas that may do something different. Think about a chat room, or a place where players can do some trades. Think about adding the possibility for players to get vip points for watching videos, or maybe one day..open world gameplay. And there could be a lot more features. Thumbs up if you agree.",
        "All round best racing game I have played so far! That said, the game becomes very difficult as one goes above REP 60. It becomes very time consuming to proceed in the game without spending actual money. Useful stuff becomes harder to obtain via docks and via older races, which is frustrating.",
        "The gameplay/races r so short. It takes less than a minute to finish it. And the police cars than u see in the gameplay don't even do anything they just keep going on on there own, sometimes getting to finish line before u. So basically this would be a perfect game for a three year old but incredibly boring for anyone over the age of 7",
        "The game is pretty good, being a free mobile game, it is not trying to hide it's PTW features, but you can do mostly everything without having to spend a penny. One suggestion I think needs to be put in place is a confirmation window when you go to skip a level, because I was doing the speedhunter event for the Mazda MX-5, and accidentally hit the skip race button and lost a lot of gold, maybe not letting me even get the upgraded car now."

        "I love this game. Its very addicting and fun, but I find that there are barely any female dragons. This upsets me very much and I would like for this to change. The only females I see are the dragons with names like  motherly dragon, belle dragon, viktoria dragons, and sleeping beauty dragons. There are also descriptions like \"add some girly pink to your collections with the gummy dragon\"(which is also coincidently a girl). Then I see cool legendary dragons, but OH plot twist they're all boys. This is a very fun game no doubt on that, but please, stop with the sexism and make cool female dragons. Thank you.",
        "Still Having Lot's of Fun! Cool to mix different dragons just to see what u get!  I just opened my 6th island, When I first started playing this game I think there were only 3 or 4 islands & maybe about 300 to 400 dragons. I'm having trouble keeping them long enough to get the next island!üòâüòÑüòÅ!!",
        "Game would be great except for the fact that you can't do certain things without bugging people on Facebook for help. I just want to play the game. I can't level my dragons past 10 without building a special building which you build without gems or bugging people. No way to get gems other than extremely slowly by completing achievements which take days to complete and give 1-3 gems. Supposedly you can watch videos for gems but there is absolutely no place on the game that allows this. If your friends on Facebook don't play this game they can't help you and you are screwed if you truly want to enjoy the game. You can't win battles with level 10 dragons. You can't breed more than one dragon at a time without gems. You can't expand past 2 islands without gems. If you get the required gems to level your dragons past 10, then there is another super expensive building to level them past 15, and get, guess what, you need gems for that too. Other games allow in game friends which this one doesn't and that is frankly ridiculous as it's a \"social\" game. Other games allow other ways to obtain gems like watching videos or trying other games which this one doesn't. There isn't enough time to complete special events for special limited dragons unless you can get gems. Overall, the game would be fantastic if gems were easier to come by and you could make in game friends instead of having to rely on Facebook friends!",
        "Just a few gripes. 1st of all I LOVE DRAGON CITY. Been playing for years. About your survey, I would never. You ask for too many permissions. Tree of life....when I get a Dragon here comes the same Dragon adding up for hatching. Like why? 815+ dragons are more than enough. Why do u keep adding, adding, adding. We could NEVER get all of them as it is. Why more? Love me some Dragon City like a said in the beginning.",
        "The game is amazing, addicting and a lot of fun just to collect and level up dragons. The events that are constantly coming on always make you feel like you have something to do. However when of the events are very unbalanced and, if you are against one of these people, not very fun. The heroic races are a great way to compete with other players to add a powerful dragon to your collection but some people take the fun out of it by spending 100's of gems to ensure that they come first. The ability to use gems during these races should be removed as it is highly unbalanced, or at least add another way of collecting the heroic dragons without having to compete with people who pay to win.",
        "THIS IS THE BEST GAME EVER!!! I totally recommend it to EVERYONE who loves addictive games and dragons. I find myself constantly playing this game all the time! I honestly feel like I can't say how much I LOVE this game with words. Again, this is the best game a player can have. Just one thing, I wish there were more ways to get gems instead of just buying 'cause I can't buy anything. So please make gems more easier to get. Also please make the islands worth less gems.üòä"

        "First off to all those saying too many ads, there aren't any ads. What you're seeing is game packs that can be purchased to help you advance within the game. I love the game. Everythingis great. I just wish they would give everyone time to adjust to previous items before creating something new. And also the pricingis too high. $20-$50 is fine but $99 is way too much.",
        "This game has become a cash cow for the developers at MZ. New features are added making the game more complex and diverse weekly. Costing players money. While old features players are familiar with and depend on break down  After contacting MZ you get a nice form letter stating thank you for bringing it to there attention but they hope you understand these things take time to fix.",
        "This game should be awesome, but the updates just come too fast now. I bought 2 packs this week and still got zeroed as soon as i dropped shield. By the time you spend 2 days clicking upgrades, someone is stronger than you and just waiting for you to try to use your new stuff.",
        "This game was fun about two years ago before MZ started trying to milk players each month for money.  If you buy a package from them,  which ranges from $14.99 to $399.99, make sure you get what you pay for. ..many times you don't get everything they promise; especially with the BOGO packages.   MZ will do little if anything to correct the matter.  Also, even after you spend tons of money, if you wait long enough they will give you the same stuff for free to all players.   My advice...find another game to play. ..something more fun and worthwhile. ..and not sponsored by MZ.",
        "If you want to be at top of this game then be prepared to spend more than the price of a top end BMW in one year. I am not kidding. MZ releases major game changing upgrades every day for several $99.99 packs. Then you get tge worst customer support in the industry. Terrible software quality control and business practices that mirror drug cartels.",
        "Mz took a once decent game and ruined it.  The weekly changes are senseless change is to be gradual.  Im finally walking away.  Im done with ur bots, done with admin accts and done with daily chances.  More and more people have quit and droves more will follow.  Choke on the money u got from all  of the foolish people who actually paid.  You deserve none of it"

        "This is a great game for any Bleach fan   Don't listen to the people who say developers don't care and only want money... this game was originally Japanese and they are transferring it over to English and this takes time.. this game is great the characters look great the game play is very good and even... lvl system is easy n fun and you get what u put into the game. Yes some characters are harder to get then others but that's what makes the game fun and worth playing.. yes the game has a VIP system for those that want to spend money to get better things or characters but that doesn't mean you have to do it to enjoy the game...",
        "I used to love this game but after two app reset wipes, I'm over it sorry going to brave souls who's with me?! Update: after reaching out to the admins on I was able to recover my data from my Google account. The data can not be transferred from ios to Android but that's fine. Thank you admins, sorry for the salt.",
        "Even though the descriptions and dialogues in the game are bit off it doesn't completely take away from the experience of the game. It still does have some bugs, like the dialogues for instance, but the game is really addictive. It's one of very few games that I've been playing religiously for the past few months, probably longer. That's the one of the main reasons why I'm giving 5 *'s. The game has an ENORMOUS amount of potential, I think if the devs got licensing rights then it would improve the game so much more. One thing I really do not like about the game is that it is kind of a pay-to-win game. You have to spend real money to advance quicker or become stronger in the game faster. Other than the cons, it really is a fun and addictive game. If you love anime, if you love fan service, if you love action games, if you just love Bleach in general then you will definitely love this game.",
        "Not very good it fell short of the other apps...it still missing half the content of the others while making it impossible without paying to collect keys.. shard collecting is lacking ...unless you want to pay for anything halfway decernt gameplay you won't find it here",
        "Been playing for the past month. I've had zero issues that I can think of that I've read others having. It's a fun and addicting game. I can't wait for all of the other characters to be added in, only thing I dislike is wanting to play them but they aren't in it. Though I understand why. Great game would certainly recommend.",
        "Only installing because i spent hundreds in the last one. Devs only care about your money, don't fix or take forever to fix issues, and the game is basically pay to win. Yiu can still get decently for free, but don't expect to get to the top that way. Take the 1 star reviews seriously... A lot of ppl stopped playing because of this games BS..."

        "Warning! Once you start playing Angry Birds Match you'll never want to stop! I love this game. I have been looking for a game that isn't so easy I get bored or too hard I get angry! This game is perfect! The only thing I would like is could you possibly offer other ways to get more lives? Like watch a video to fill up ( like angry birds pop) or spin the wheel? I just hate waiting soooo long when I run out of lives, because I want to keep playing!!!!",
        "I've enjoyed this game, but I haven't been able to open it for several days. I hate to uninstall and lose all my progress. Any help would be appreciated. Ok, so after about a month of not loading it started working...for a month now it's down again. I upgraded today, 2/19, and still won't open, grrrr! Help!! Changed my 5 stars to 1! The game constantly freezes, closes and then won't reload. I've reinstalled 4 times and that's it I'm done. Really disappointing as when it runs it's so much fun.",
        "For some reason right in the middle of playing it has been quitting and then I lose that life. Very frustrating. Is there and update available?",
        "I love this game but for like 3 months since i updated I can't play and I just updated again and still the same doesn't let the game download it frozes, can you please fix that, or let me know what i can do, I dont want to uninstall it so I don't loose my progress.  Starting to get aggravated.  Thank you.",
        "I like this game a lot and would give higher reviews but a lot of times if I am playing a level and have one move left it ends the level and I never get to make the move. It's some kind of glitch in the game. I think it's trying to get me to buy gems and coins. Very frustrating and annoying.",
        "It seems to me that the objects to move are too small, it is always moving wrong way that I am trying to move. You should be able to select move by tapping, then swipe."

Why is that? Now the only way for me to earn more gems os through the free gems  (by watching adds), getting a high enough ranking in battlez, or buying them.",
        "I think the new update is nice battlez is awesome and the good news is that my phone doesnt crashes anymore and when I played Inzanity it did'nt lag great rework but 1 question, WHY DID YOU REMOVE ULTIMATE BATTLE AND DEMONSTRATION MINI GAME THEMES TO EVERY WORLD?? Im sick of every level with just only themes",
        "I think the new update is very cool. It adds some multiplayer into the game. When I heard of this new update I rushed to my phone and started playing. It turned out to be good I was happy and thought it would turn out well. Then after that I remembered pvz one. It's multiplayer mode was much better. One player would be plants and the other zombies. Why could they not have made that. It was such a good idea. I would personally play that mode more than this. But it's just my opinion. Thanks for reading.",
        "Since last update it is very unstable and keeps crashing. Also every time i finish the last inzanity it crashes then once reloaded says expired so ive lost out. In fact im not that interested anymore. Im not a fan of battlez and it all seems geared to that now so had fun while it lasted.",
        "I HATE YOUR UPDATE. Battlez mixed battle between players who bought plants with money with the players who don't is totally unfair. There are many players out there like me who play everyday collecting coins by coins and gems by gems patiently waiting for a good plant offer that we can buy with gems. Buying plants with money is not on the budget. I'm not angry. I'm sad. Because PVZ is always one of my top listed games. Now it's pathetic. Crashed. Unfair. Expensive.",
        "Just like.But EA just want money right? You just wasting money.Money cause something bad.This wirld need to follow the truth path.Not money path.I dont like those plant,pinatas and more that need to buy with money.Useless."

However, since it's international the time for coop game should be more flexible so i can join with my friends at suitable time.

Then why are people talking about quitting? These are high paying players. I know you plan on making it so hero's bought for special skills like stun and silence won't work if there's a big gap. You've made it so hero's bought for the purpose of moving these budgeted p2w are useless. So it's in favor of real p2w. It should be a reverse. Make the lower people have a better chance not a worse one.",
        "I found an issue, when I defeat the boss by bleed damage, the victory screen doesn't show up. It just stuck at the boss level with its dead body lying on the ground. I hope you fix this. Great game by the way.",

Awesome. :P Net connectivity is as good that when other apps show good connection under high speed wifi, ot shows no connectivity. Lol",
        "Freakking great. Best chess app EVER!!!!. I have the free one and it can teach you tactics, help you in situations and if you dont want that no need to do it. You can even costumize your wallpaper or theme. Skill ratings 100-2600 playing real people. Or you can play a computer, 400-1200 or 1400 i think. Great app, get it you wont regret it.",
        "I think this app is horrible simply.. I'm a diamond member, but I don't think i will be for much longer. There's other chess sites that don't disconnect and lag so much. Main dislikes is the constant disconnection, no order at all in the videos section. Tactics, lessons and drills bugs and crashes when turning the mobile or screen goes off. Specially drills bugs and just repeats the same one over and over when you finished instead of going to the next one. Also, app was unhappy I was logged in on my turned off computer.. come on..",
        "I cannot respond to chats. The support team promises they will fix the issue, but it's only lies so that I can give the app a decent rating. Now my custom board, pieces, and background settings get reset every 2 days. Frustrating app.",
        "The last update sucks! Premove is not at all intuitive. It now just shows the block which we want to move the pawn and doesn't move the pawn itself like before. The toast message that showed 'challenge rejected' was better than the current one. Dislike it!!",
        "I have no connection issues but some times game discontinues with showing no n/w.pls solve otherwise good game Finally uninstalled... Worst team."

        "This game is amazing! But enemy units keep getting stuck behind walls Also there are a few enemy lands that are not responding when you tap on them. This didnt happen before.  I think updating attack list would be good. So you could see who you have attacked, not just who attck you. Just  a thought",
        "It's a great game but I think it be better if you created workers and mined,  lumbered, and gather favors or technology like warcraft use to be like.  The commands are also touchy and the battle displays for viewing if kinda difficult to  keep up with. But it's fun and a little bit addictive.",
        "Amazing graphic but really poor gameplay... Even lowest level, it's hard to complete easy campaign. Every win need to paid. Useless to raid... Uninteresting how the mission needed to complete... Disliked this game bcoz of the poor gameplay and the way of how to complete the mission.",
        "Ive been playing this game a very long time now. definitly a 5 star game in every aspect. only issue is.. i spend money on this last event.. 3 raids left to get 14k reward for the 4 star poison ranger.. the bloody game hang again..manage to log back only when the event was over..!!! Now i have this 2 useless relics taunting me.. Almost felt like deleting the game..",
        "One of these game where you need to pay to play if you want to be any good, slow if any support. If you don't have a life, you can get good a this game real quick. If you have low self-esteem, stay away, experience gamers will tear you a new one repeated, makes progressing to new lvls  slow."

        "I stop playing C C because I loved this game... I noticed that we use way more than we get!! And to only get a few tickets for every 10 Bingo's then having to wit for 22hrs....only 4 tickets and hr...and it takes way to long to get to the next level and when do reach it we get very little tickets!!! Dont have to many deals to get both tickets and special prizes... Also how does it when a game starts right after a tournament that I end up in the thousand plus  rank below the bronze??? As much as I love this game think its time to give it a rest until there re more incentives to bring me back!!!",
        "My game keep freezing up and not submitting my scores not giving me boosters I acquired during that round. Please fix the issues and give me back my points and boosters. Thank you   I just played again and I played the whole game but when it's time to tally the score the game freezes. I lost 3 footballs and a treasure chest plus my points. Please respond to my issues. I haven't heard from anyone yet. But I still like the game. Just want it to stop robbing me....",
        "This is definitely a fun bingo app. Where it's lacking or otherwise could be improved, comparatively to ther Bingo games, is the daily spin wheel & daily sign in bonus. Daily 24hr sign in should provide a much larger number of free tickets & include daily free power ups. Earning one or two power ups w a single spin of the wheel is anticlimactic! Power ups are a vital way to  daily tournament advancement, bingo wins & simy make playing more fun. Completing a pizzule is impossible without power-ups or making a purchase. However, a big win for this app. is the ability to sign in each new day to a new tournament which helps level the playing field. Special tournaments and/or the add' side bonuses, like the \"turkey daub\" made playing & making a purchase worth wild!",
        "Good, keeps me coming back for more. The only thing I don't like is there is no way of getting that many puzzle pieces in the time. Could you maybe let us play till we get the Puzzle Complete to get the rewards.",
        "I am addicted to this game. I think you should get more power ups instead of ticket's. Cause you run out of power up's. I feel you should get bingo power up's instead of ticket's. On the bonus spin they should add bingo power up's of 4. I need more bingo power up's. And would like to get power up's for daubing every number called each game. I need more power Up's. And the game should give you tickets when you get every number that is called correctly on each card every game that you play.",
        "The new additions of the outlaws was great, but then you added all these \"special\" days that serve no purpose but to make people spend money. I have spent plenty already but not for every game. Sorry guys, bad move. Too greedy."

Got attk 12 times in a row by same player of higher lvl. Also If you have issues with game content good luck getting a good answer on that too.",
        "Hi A.K server 52. Have been playing for couple of months now and still love the game.just when you think you are on top of things something new comes up. I personally like the challenge and new changes.for those who have not played this game before I would recommend it.  Very addictive. If you are going to spend money in this game spend wisely.",
        "After last update, this game getting worst, score for pirate event has been reduced, and the pirate getting stronger.. fix it fast.. many player complaining about this Nick : Premi06 Server : 041",
        "Please add more vessels like USS Carl Vinson, and enabled to play offline too. And please make no time limits to purchase for the new promotion with a cheap price such as new ships or aircrafts, when that happened I bet there will be more interesting. Thanks.",
        "If you don't have money to burn then don't play this game. This game is the embidiment of the 'pay to win' phrase and would make EA look like a baby when it comes to that. Levels are easy to scale up in the beginning but as you cross level 10 through 20, you'd realise that without paying through your nose, you are just fodder for paying players. Don't be a sheep they'd like you to be. On top of that, the game is riddled with bugs and the developers are unresponsive, unless again you are a paying player. Do yourself a favor and Invest your time in another game."

        "It's a great Game. My only issue is there are bullies in the game and you have to always be on to Protect your Fortress and Buoys or they will be destroyed and then you loose everything. Seems everywhere you go there are bullies. And they take forever to do a server merge when you're server is dieing. But overall still a good Game. Also there needs to be a server merge for a few servers. Some of the servers are dieing and some players are quitting because there's nothing new and the targets are slim to none. And alot are written to Joy City and asked for a merger and get nothing. Something needs to be done",
        "Great work in new update joycity. You guys always remove one bug and add tons of other bugs in every update. After March update I can see what I'm typing in chat box until I send it.",
        "Fun game if you keep buying packs.   Too many daily updates that keep you waiting to play until update is done.  Very lousy customer service.",
        "Latest update today 21/3 terrible played for 30 secs froze had to turn off happened few times in a row now please fix",
        "Is a scam as I brought a pack for the quest and it wouldn't count towards it but has no info telling people about the problem but Has potential to be a great game but when I wrote to joy city stating the server I play on is pretty much dead and hard to find active people they told me to create a new profile on a new server after putting hours and spending alot on this game they need to sort out there customer care team after being told that it's wrong especially player like me and others who spend money on game and also sort out all these dead servers to make the game exciting again"

        "It's pay to win for sure. However, if you play daily and stick to monthly and quarterly cards you'll rack up gems and heroes quickly. It took me over a year to get my VIP high enough to get the monthly meta heroes. I get an hour or two a day out of it and even when I didn't have the monthly paid heroes I had a fun time. I don't mind spending $15/month for the amount of time the game helps me kill.",
        "I'm a paying customer, which they call \"VIP\" but you best believe you are far from important. I had an issue with a purchase in December, but support takes a week per message to reply and isn't useful at all about the issue and tells you they can't help. Should have let Google refund the money before the 48 hours instead of giving their support a chance.",
        "Don't download the game . If u want to win u must spend thousands dollars. A huge skins with control every month 2 new heroes with amazing power. Every month making new heroes and the old ones getting trash. Random game no strategy. Just click for pic. Ucool don't do anything. Don't download!!! I played more than one year and every month it's getting worst. The forgetting about players. They think only for cash. Ucool one of the worst organisation..if u don't spend a money please don't start the game .nice pictures  and that it )))",
        "This game was a very well balanced game between free play gamers and those that put money into it. Not anymore. If you want to be competitive you must put handreds of dollars each month (no joke). Very dissapointed in the way this game has become.",
        "A very good game but a pay to win. I myself paid 73$ and I am VIP 8. This game can be fun without paying but to get the most out of it atleast  buy an annual card for 30$. If you have even more to throw away try buying all the cards when they run out get a new one. (Mainly Annual and Season Card. Week card isn't a must have). Also if you are new to the game wait for a new server to start. That way you wont fall behind. I am on server 210 and have also played on server 207. I was in this game when it was brand new and purple heroes were the best. I was in 1 of the 1st servers and f2P I quit the game at lvl 50 though. All in All if you want to play this game prepare 100$",
        "The menu is very unresponsive when scrolling. Also, when killing enemies, particularly after using a special ability, the enemy simply freezes and then fades away - there's no animation for the death of the enemy and this is disappointing and detracts from the immersion. Otherwise it's a good game, but significantly more heroes would be necessary to keep me interested."

        "Fun until you get to Miami.. absolutely impossible to make 100 000.00 to unlock the next level.  Computer outbids or up bids you so that you either give up or lose your money.  No daily incentives to keep brining you back.  Unless you are willing to spend real money for boosters and money to move on.. play to Miami and then delete.. impossible to move forward after that.",

Its to hard to make that kind of money playing and now its just playing the same level over and over trying to get enough. Now its boring!! I'm disappointed, I really enjoyed playing until that point.",
        "Was a great game until I got to Miami level 19 now just bloody stupid & waste of time. I went to 4 straight auctions couldn't buy a unit because competitors bid more than what the units worth how are you suppose to level up & move on when the designers of the game make stupid unrealistic flaws in the game no bidder is going to bid in real life on items they can't see or know are there so why put this into the game? Fix this issue & I will adjust my review accordingly!",

Meaning you need to pay to do them. I really find it a nice read but since the books are few i'm on hold on purchasing diamonds. I guess once a series is completed i'm willing to buy diamonds to replay that game. For now i'm just browsing the game and taking notes on how many diamonds are going to cost per book.",

However the problem is the pass, the pass is too little and the time is pretty long to wait. I hope this app would give much pass and please make the time shorter. But still this game is awesome, I recommend this game for you. You should download this app and try it."

But, there's not enough energy or chances to win energy or earn it. 10 isnt enough!There's times when I'm out of energy and have done everything I can do and have to leave the game but still feel like playing. I've spent money on this game but I don't always have money to buy energy or coins to buy energy. There should be more give-a-ways, prizes, little games, etc to earn more energy so I can keep playing!! Also, I'd like to be able to friend request other players and send them things. Like people on my team on here.  Thank you! Lynn Mauger",

        "Pretty cool Bingo. It would be nice if more scratchers were available to collect puzzle pieces so you can collect more prizes. Even though you can still win cherries after you completed the scratcher, it seems kind of pointless. My suggestion would be either add more scratchers or remove it once all of the cherry prizes have been collected.",
        "By far, the best bingo app on the market.  There aren't any false numbers or bingo daubs . It also gives you a chance to  earn the cherries instead of paying for them.   They've mixed in ads to the game so it doesn't feel like you're watching commercials between every game.",
        "Out of cherries in less than an hour. Wins are not enough to keep playing. Odd that they would even have a high roller room. Guess you gotta purchase the cherries. FAIL",
        "Wouldn't even let me play. Kept saying I was too young to play even though it didn't give me an option to enter my age",
        "It would be great if there was a way to collect coins and cherries on the Facebook app page. Kind of frustrating",
        "I didnt think you could make a game suck any more than it already did but you guys did it the game sucked before now it sucks even more you guys need to fire the person that updates your game he or she has never played a game of real bingo because this game is nothing like real bingo"

        "Absolutely sublime! This game is so awesome it's exactly what I want in a dragon game! Although there are microtransactions, you can absolutely play this game without spending a cent to progress! I have never ever payed real money to purchase gold, food and all other resources and I've played this game for almost two years The two tips are a little bit of patience and to keep on breeding. Even if you've already bred a certain pair of dragons, selling unwanted eggs is the best and quickest way to make gold",
        "Once you get to level 100, breeding a dragon is almost impossible to nil. Very frustrating. My roommate and I started this game the same time. I am level 115 and she is on 83. We will breed the same dragons at the same time, she will succeed 85% of the time on the first try, it will take me over 10 times if I even get it, this started after level 100. Good luck long term players.",
        "The events are annoying. I have reached the max on collecting eggs. I just gather then from doing tasks. Does that mean I can't participate anymore and am just stuck. I don't understand. Why would you limit the gathering of items?",
        "Have been playing this game for a couple of years now and I love it! Sometimes it's frustrating - especially when you'd need to buy something to be able to get all the prizes during events - but it just makes it more challenging.  VERY happy with the customer support. I had an issue with a gift not being added to my totals, so I emailed them and they fixed it without issue.",
        "The game is definitely addicting. But when I went into the Egg-straordinary Egg hunt island and tapped on a activty, it said their was a wonky spell and it completely stopped the whole game. I've tried different things different times, and it still won't work. I have played this in the past and the same exact thing happened, but with something different.",
        "This game is AWSOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOme. I had 1023 gems saved up and then it glitched and now I only have 34. I love this game so much! Please help me get my 984 gems back! I don't want to rate it lower than 5 stars, but this has happened twice now...üòü"

        "At first I thought it was great, but now I realise it's just another PAY-TO-WIN game... You've got no chance if you come up against a paid-for character like Batman. It's such a shame this is the way game devs are heading these days.",
        "*Update Very greedy company-&gt; bad rating from me! They sell packages for 200-300 dollars! What's worse is that there are people who are stupid enough to pay for it. Aside from that a very cool game. To be at the very top it is pay to win. Besides that really cool. Lots of heroes and therefore possibilities.",
        "It's a great game don't get me wrong but as I wrote in previous reviews they just went completely pay-to-win. Nowadays you cannot win not only because you don't have the latest gacha heroes, you just can't win because they released Batman for $160 to be competitive, most broken character ever. They are also releasing legendary pets... For $400 each. So yes, forget about having a fun competition, some players are simply out of you range by how much money they have spent and that ruins the experience.",
        "My first review disappeared so I will leave another.  This game was great at first, then it started inserting the buyable characters such as Batman, Assassin's Creed and they are so over powered, one of them can take down your whole team without taking any damage.  Game is now so unbalanced that it isn't worth playing.  Until they fix the game, it worth playing.  Unless you like wasting money to feel like a god with over powered characters.  Game is dead, play something else.",
        "definitely one of the best game if not the best game ived ever played on mobile. when you pull a hero for free the feeling is incomparable. the strategy you need to bring down other tougher players/guilds, its all here i tell ya! and to cap it all off the customer service is GREAT. you have concerns they reply ASAP what more could one ask for?!  install now! =)",
        "Had the potential to be good but they care more about money than a good game, once you progress so far you will constantly lose to ppl who have bought characters that are vastly over powered. They will auto reply and say plenty of ppl still have fun without out paying, I made it to level 65 and it's just not true."

They do not follow their own rules.  They do not compensate players for their mistakes.  They let Chinese player buy packs cheaper and use at accounts.  If you are a Westerner do not play or pay on this game.  Their customer service sucks.  They actually try to get you to feel sorry for them.  Its amazing.  They will only steal from you.",
        "This is definitely a pay to win game.  And I agree with previous reviews saying it favors Chinese players.  The developers claim it's not, but if it wasn't true, then why are 99% of the servers dominated by Chinese players?  Plus the Chinese to English translations are terrible.  You will barely understands what they're saying.",

Like things that have been improved on in this genre of game in other apps are still frustrating here. Oh well, what can I expect from a freemium game? Overall it's enjoyable but I have to take it in doses; basically until I get frustrated by the gameplay or other players. All in all, there are worse was to spend your time."

Play in tournaments, and get rewards to assist in your upgrading. What's not to love,  course I'd like to see this game run without an internet connection so I could play offline too...thanks.",
        "Not a great game. Played for half the day. Game will no longer start and tells me to make sure I'm connected to the net. Oh I'm really that dumb. World chat is more like a dating site and is not child friendly. The admins do nothing to stop the behaviour in world chat. I strongly advise you not to allow your kids anywhere near this game",
        "If your hobby is watching paint dry this is the game for you. This game is entirely too time consuming for anyone with a real life. Which I guess is why no one is here for the game . Everyone playing is here to get credits in another game .  Which is why this game has so many downloads  not because it's actually good. The over-sexualized comments in the chat rooms are ridiculous. Parents if you are reading this I would not allow my child to play this game unless you are going to sit with them every moment. If you have to do that is it even really worth allowing your child to play the game.",
        "Basically clash of clans looking ads, plays like just any other mmo. Another Mr steal your money if you wanna get good game. If you want something thats fun and never ever going to try to take your money, play clash. 5 years of playing it and ive only bought a 5$ thing bc gems just come so easily and im a lvl170 th10 . No need to spend money to get good",
        "Ummmmm basicly Clash of Clans COPY CAT!!! The adds almost match precisely. If anything download Clash of Clans. I mean this is just insulting to clash of clans and how hard they worked to make clash of clans... lazy! I just downloaded the game to rate it... enjoy my one star review lazy jerks... rate this a one star and download clash of clans.",
        "The game is supposed to be for battling your enemy but you spend countless hours sorting through the packs which are random at best in content offering very little for the price paid. They encourage you to register the game with an email account but give you the run around should you seek to change it. The game is not worth the time nor money."

This would fail state regulations on gambling games. Fun but a sucker game for rolling anything that counts as statistically random",
        "This is fun, IF you can figure it out. I like playing yahtzee but this is complicated. Every time I get extra dice, the ???? spends them or takes them away from me so I don't get to spend them the way I want to. That sucks.",

On a chess exercise game with a recurring subscription fee to fully unlock?? Every single thing about this game is designed to be such a ridiculous money grab I actually laughed. It does have a very nice interface but there are a lot of completely free or one time purchase alternatives that are every bit as good.. Definitely don't waste your time and money on this..",
        "OK guys as far as the overall experience with the app was good I could use it all the time to progress my skill at playing chess just like anybody i.e.  any practice  1 possible flaw or idea that I've found which may shift Play Magnus app's popularity is to make a free version of the Magnus Trainer app with only the free content intending this app to be a demo and add more daily activities and challenges to keep them on your app longer  which of course will always end prompting the user to download Premium Magnus which requires an initial $5.00  purchase to begin downloading Magnus Trainer Premium enabling user full access to all the content app offers them. Followed by subscription payments made monthly at the set price of $5.   Might be dumb idea but food for thought I know Runescape had their free server separated from Members only servers also at $5 / mo.  People may  be able  to understand more clearly that if they want the full  app to get way better skills on the board if they want lessons of this caliber then it requires subscriptions to support your hard working team.   The haters will always hate... Keep it up good app",

        "Love it to pieces. The characters are loveable and the stories are fun. I got through three to four in a few days I can't put it down. The only downside is certain decisions cost gems. Major ones are fine and expected but to have to be a jerk to someone because you don't have enough kind of sucks a little. But it's not often and by no means a deal breaker.",
        "Actually, I came here because I'm a fan of Jakayla Toney. I'm a reader from wattpad, and I'm checking out her story here as game. üòÇ Anyways, I finished one chapter and I'm enjoying so far. Gotta check out other book after I'm done. Looking forward to this app, though I don't really like the choices costing gems.But its okay, still like it. üòä",
        "Every GOOD choice involved money.  Hard to find one interactive story game that doesn't involve money so much.  I don't mind paying for extra bonus scenes in the end but at least give us some GOOD selection WITHOUT charging!  Then maybe I'll rate it higher",
        "I've really enjoyed reading All the Wrong reasons.  The author is very talented, a true story teller.  As I was reading I felt like part of the story I was so enveloped in the lives of the characters they were alive and real. I was sad when the story ended wanted to keep reading.  I was overjoyed when K. I. S. S.  came out by that very sane author who transported me to a whole new world yet again. I look forward to reading more from this amazingly talented storyteller!!",
        "I'm frustrated by the fact that this is supposed to be a choose your own adventure game, but all the choices that make the most sense to me are stuck behind a paywall, requiring me to purchase those choices with a currency called diamonds. I get the story passes, and I would have been fine if that was the only barrier to read the story, but to require you to pay money for making what you feel are the right choices is just greedy.",
        "The only reason I'm giving 3 stars is because the chapters update too late that you lose interest and sometimes forget what's happening in the story. If the chapters were to update on a regular basis then readers would feel the need to keep this app and will constantly play instead of playing the waiting game. However the content is good and most storylines get you hooked."

If you want to play at the highest level you HAVE TO PAY! There is a very clear pay wall and everyone knows it. If your starting off and your free to play it will take you awhile and I don't even think it will be work it unless you plan to put at least 6 month in to be somewhat relevant.",

Cons: ‚Ä¢ Constant Pop-ups reminding you to purchase loot boxes. ‚Ä¢ You will get wrecked by serious pay-to-wins. ‚Ä¢ Impossible drop rates for 5‚òÜ characters and Chaos/Order heros. ‚Ä¢ Paying to unlock 5‚òÜ heros that may or may not be 5‚òÜ. ‚Ä¢ The company spamming copy pasted messages to players who have beef with thier game instead of constructive replies.  Overall: Still a pretty cool game.",

Constant pop ups, easily 40-50 store pop ups per day sometimes multiple times within a minute.  the Lucky 7 quest was criminal, horrendous design & I won't be spending a penny with you guys again until I see you go down a better path.   the positives, autoing but being able to leave the game. Festival/ hero events are pretty damn good although it be nice to see different style events that 'have gameplay'  Characters are well designed & are extremely fun to use.   To summarise, has some excellent features but it's let down by some horrendous balancing & constant cash grabs that would get EA taking notes.",

        "The more I play the more this game is broken ... the AI for the troupes constantly suicide even if you keep rallying them , I am lvl 169 and I am constantly getting attacked by lvl 220 and up no lies , I can give screenshots because that is fair ... this is 1-5 times at least per hour ... this game from very fun became very frustrating. The game creators could give 2 sh/ts about what is going on .",
        "My phone is not rooted or jail broken, I do not have any hacks installed. I get a message saying illegal program detected by XIGNCODE3. Even after multiple uninstalls/installs, reboots, cache clears. All that time and energy wasted!!!",
        "This is the game I have been searching for. But can't give 5 star because of 2 main reasons. Consume too many data while playing that required fast network and too many bugs... Problems free=5 stars.. What happen? I cannot even play the game now.. I once install and play and later uninstall because of game problem. Now I install and try to play again. I cannot play.. What is the problem? I also want to recover my account too..",
        "Gameplay and graphics is great BUT as you progress you spend more time upgrading units and buildings. Some upgrades take up to a week of upgrading rendering those villagers useless aswell as the rate at which resources comes in as you collect doesnt compensate enough for the costs of upgrades. Its unnecessarily STRETCHED OUT. because of this its a 3 star rating...DONT DOWNLOAD IF YOU HAVE NO PATIENCE. Been playing a year and i dont feel my progress is a representation of the time i have put in. Been playing almost daily!",
        "This is the exact definition of a strategy game, the controls are great and its free. You get to choose your own nation which just adds to the strategy, plus whatever you do in a battle can affect the entire battle. I would recommend it to people who want something with strategy and a bit of hardcoreness. The learning curve is quite steep sometimes."

        "Addictive and engrossing game.  The bonus covers work well. The constant character tweaking and release rate makes the vs progression awards with wins is very good.  The favorites is a good way to let folks focus on building certain characters.  The transition points are still frustrating, especially when you get a run of bad luck with tokens.  Tokens might work better if they scaled instead. Biggest issue is progression awards in versus and the tough transitions in levels.",
        "I have been playing this game for a few years now and love it! But a little suggestion... Because of the time I've spent playing it and the already difficult ability to get 4 and 5 star characters, I have nearly 3 million iso-8 that I literally cannot spend. Please add a way to convert iso-8 into hero points or command points!!! I'd like to get further in the game instead of literally stockpiling iso-8. This has all been done without spending a single dollar on the game too, btw",
        "This is an awesome, addictive and hyper fun game. Brilliant idea and concept. In all the games I have played this is the first I have spent money on. VIP member. Have a couple suggestions for developer tho. Can you add abilities to swap covers with alliance members and maybe add as a bonus drop for playing, an extra free slot. Keep up the brilliant work. Truely love this game.",
        "This is my go-to game. Day and night. It's fun, simple and sometime challenging. My only complaint is that i have like a million of Iso-8 and don't know what to do with them. My thought would be that if we don't need so much Iso-8, be sweet to give some to aliance member who needs it or so on. Great game. Don't know what I'd do without it!",
        "Suitable for all age groups, Marvel Puzzle Quest is a great game for everyone. Progress with higher tier characters may be slow but yet significant. The wide variety of heroes and villians within the game allows for endless possibilities of the \"best team\". Highly addictive, I would recommend this perfect game to anyone and everyone.",
        "Love that they are always adding new characters. Would like to see some different characters like Cable, Domino, Sabretooth, and Bishop just to name a few. Just because they don't have a movie... Would also like to see some new events, new animations, and less repetitiveness. Love the collection part and finally being able to use characters when you've finally built their powers enough. Love that it can be played for free. Love that feedback is read and the game is constantly evolving.Thanks."

        "To the guy that says stop bitching cuz it's free. Reviews are so they can get feedback to improve the game. What good is the game if you can only play 2 games a day? There are too many other games out there that are free that customers can get chips to play for hours. This game should take care of their loyal customers before they move on to some of the other games. So many have posted about the small amount of chips received and they added the spinning wheel, maybe by reading the reviews they are listening and trying to improve chances of getting more chips. If everyone continues to give low reviews, maybe just maybe they'll increase our chances to get more daily chips!",
        "Purchased 90 rockets pack. Explained to me how I used all 90 in one game? Smh, that's too much.. So y'all want ppl to purchase rockets each hand. Y'all can do better. Chip packages as well. Maybe u will get more to contribute to the game. Smh, better chip packages probably will definitely help this game. Especially the price of chips to play verses what the rooms payout... Really is at a disadvantage to players to even purchase.",
        "I usually love this game. However, today I decided to treat myself and purchase some chips to get the last two battle ships that I needed to get 800 chips. The game is so frigging rigged it's just sad. It took all 600 chips that I bought and all that I won trying to accomplish a goal.  I will NEVER purchase chips again, especially in this game.",
        "Most of my purchases lately have been strange disappearing chips and rockets i have spent SO much  money on this game!!! and another thing i could not access any games for 2 days now but it TOOK ALL MY CHIPS AGAIN SOMETHING NEEDS TO BE DONE I HAVE ALREADY CONTACTED YOU IN REGARDS TO THIS.",
        "Good variety of games. Not many free chips once the first few rounds are played when compared to what the rounds cost. Be ready to buy, buy, buy if you aren't patient. They have added many more chances for free chips. Thank you guys.",
        "I love the game again.  I'd been struggling with glitches and now they're fixed  I'm especially loving the free chips you give sometimes daily!  I've become re-addicted to it!  The new format IS easier to see, but it gets slightly boring when the two cards you CAN daub don't get any numbers!  It looks as if you're phasing out the gems, which is fine with me; I'd rather have all free daubs, chips, and only a FEW coin power plays.  The free daubs make all the difference between winning and losing.  Also, would like to see winning bingos actually give me the items I need to complete rooms and for you to increase the daily chips for every completed room."

        "For a free game? I can't complain too much especially if i don't pay for it. The containers are actually a good addition to this game since you get containers for free. If you're lucky enough you can win a premium tank and those things are not cheap! But wargaming actually give them away for free. The event is impossible to finish if you don't pay with gold and to win a tank you must pay a huge amount of $$$. But for casual and f2p players? I think you'll enjoy it. It's a game guys, play for fun!",
        "The game is good compared to the game i often play online. I could have rated this game all five stars. The controls for driving must have other options to choose from. And its not suitable for android phones that has 5 inches sreen display. My thumb keeps slipping off whenever i try to maneauver the  vehicle. On Pc's much more easier to handle using a keyboard and a mouse.",
        "Hello. I love WOT and trying to play together witg my son. But we've chosen different servers (Europe & Russia) and now i cant find him in the players list to be able to join one platoon. I also cant connect to his server and he cant connect to mine cause system doesnt allow it. can you please suggest how we can join one platoon in this case? Thank you.",
        "Best mobile game I've played, more fun than the PC world of tanks for sure. Only real complaint is that it takes up a lot of space on my phone... It's worth the investment in memory though. Make sure you're in a good wifi spot and have a portable battery and happy tanking",
        "Not a bad game.  I'm a little sick of the unrealistic tanks.  Also the unrealistic play in some ways.  I wish there was a mode that limited you to real tanks of the same time period and had more realistic damage based on the weapons.  For example, I don't want to see the Dracula tank and the 88mm on my Tiger should blow a Sherman away in 1 shot at point blink range, not 6 shots...",
        "Why is 6 of my team on one area while I am in the other. Because of this spawning system I died literally 5 seconds after the battle started. Great game though. Why is there so much lag. And why are my controls frozen. I move forward a  little and then I move 50 feet away from my spot. Fix this and then you get a big fat 5 stars."

I think they asked, but I came all by myself to rate it because its a grate game! Gorgeous graphics, controls are excellent, music is good  and most of all its quite interesting! Way to go people ! Thank you! Came back to update on my experience with this game. Over a month paying no  surprises, no adds, no asking to rate it just wonderful. Challenging at times than easyer and so on. Congratulations to the creators of this game and keep up the grate job!!! I am at the level 126!",

There's a glitch that I wish would be fixed before I decide to uninstall for good. Lost all of my gold bars, all of my cherries upon reinstall. It's a shame.",

I have to restart  saving for  golds after the evil update, and I just lost all the 40 golds by wiping play on accidently due to slow respones of the game."

        "I absolutely love this game. I make it a point to not spend money on mobile games cus they typically turn out to be a cash trap, but this was just like buying a regular video game. No adds, and even before buying the full game it doesn't shove \"buy our product\" notifications down your throat. Nintendo has always had good games and I have no doubts that I will keep playing this every day.",
        "Was pretty short to begin with but Nintendo has supported this game well, adding additional content, even a new mode. The simplified game mechanics to fit Mario gaming on a phone work great and feel natural. The story with it's additional challenges to open new courses are fun, toad run is addictive, the remix 10 is somewhat redundant content wise but also good. I'd rather pay $10 up front than have in-game purchases, the reception to this game indicates that I'm very much in the minority on that. Great game, very fun for a quick session of Mario.",
        "Awesome update! Make the game worth again, when it seems Nintendo had abandoned Super Mario Run, they back and release more content for the half of the price. This is the kind of update I was waiting for, once I didn't paid the game yet, I think this could be a great time to purchase. Probably in the future they will release more content, but the price will back to 9.99, so the best time to purchase is now! Great job Nintendo, I love your games since my childhood.",
        "Awesome and all, but you only get 4 levels for free. To go to world 2, WHY IN THE UNIVERSAL WORLD RIGHT HERE IN A CITY (lolüòÄ) DO YOU HAVE TO BUY WORLD 2, 3, 4, 5, AND 6? TALK ABOUT A RIPOFF! üòû (Warning to Nintendo: If you dont fix this soon, I'm deleting. Sorry!)",
        "Favorite game. It has a one time cost for full version and not a monthly fee or several different things you have to buy to enjoy it. I like the updates with the remix, and the star courses. I didnt like that there was so little to do before I bought it. I got bored quick. But was surprised by the cost, and love it after buying it. I do wish we could see our friends land and share things we don't need and give rally tickets to others.",
        "This is just proof Nintendo can make amazing games no matter the platform. All the bad reviews are people's mad you gotta pay for the game. Lol wut? It's a great time killer made  by the best gaming company in the world and you're mad it's not free? Funny. There's no IAP.  It's not pay to win. But it is the most fun 5$ will ever buy you."

No way of contacting support/help desk either as just get error message when trying. Hugely disappointed after all the months of playing!",

Don't like how I have to pay to plant my own crops on my own island though?! And why has the harvest count changed? Why make bad changes to the game? It just shys people away.",

BUT if you are not in their beta test group it's getting discouraging that you are not treated as equal as the others and you need to put much more effort and time to get rewards and move along in the levels. Don't start unless you like to be treated with no respect at all",

This morning when I was using it tho the time it would take for things to be done was reduced greatly, everything was 2 mins, 5 mins, 10 mins and 15, and I was impressed and decided that if its a new update I'd glady play more often. The second time I went back on everything was back to the old time period of production. I was disappointed and didn't bother to spend even 5mins more on it. I believe everyone would find it more exciting to play if the time for production wasn't so long. I hope that this can happen in another update, if not, well I can't do nothing about that.",
        "Gave it a lower rating because I sent 3 messages to support regarding loading error and never received a response just kept sending me to the games web page which was of no help. Very fun game but no support it seems",
        "I love this game! It is my favorite! I like how can earn gems! I love the different 'contests.' However, I tried really hard to get the snowy owl and didn't make it in time. Now I'm not playing as much but still love the game!"

        "Everything about this game is great, but this company/developer really differentiate themselves from the competition with their customer service and support. Any issues I've ever had with adcap or any kongregate apps were handled extremely quick with the most professions experience.   Try the game, it's addicting, challenging, and very fun. It is a freemium game but don't forget to support the devs but purchasing a gift pack or even just downloading a game you like for $1.  Thank you for the hard work guys/gals",
        "About a few years ago, I had this installed on a Droid phone. I never was able to open the app to play. Recently, I glanced through the apps I had & remembered this one. After thinking it over, I decided to get it. Now, I am happy the developers decided to upgrade the game. This is fun. I am contemplating letting the üí∞ accumulate for one full day just to see how much I earn. Thank you developers for providing a fun little time waster. I recommend this if you are the type of person who üíò s making fake money. Try it out & hopefully you enjoy it.",
        "Yes this is addictive, yes it's fun, and it's great because you can spend 12 seconds or 12 minutes on it and still get the same amount of enjoyment. BUT, and this is a very big but, this game is a HUGE drain on your battery. And no, I don't have an iPhone - I have a proper phone - a Sony XZ Pro. So it's not the weedy battery. No game I have ever played drains the battery away as fast as this game does, so it's clearly an issue that I wish they could fix.",
        "Was having fun until the game decided to take about 30 of these megabucks from me for no apparent reason. Took me a while to get them considering how far I am. Not sure if I want to play anymore knowing this could happen again. Other than that it's pretty good.",
        "I really liked the game but I hate the pay to win more stuff and all the ads and incentives to go download and play other games. I know that's what mobile games have become but I want to just enjoy a simple clicker game in peace without a thousand tie ins and adds ruining my sense of immersion. Oh vanilla cookie clicker how I miss you. The game itself is great. Tying in a leader board with a game that incentivizes you to pay real world money to increase your earning rate in game seems messed up, but once again that is what mobile games have become.",
        "It clicks on adds with out me hitting it at all. Then when I get back to the app it forgets that I watched the add at all even tho I watched all the way through. It happens repeatedly. It only forgets half the time but it almost always clicks on the adds. Other than that it's a good time killer with easy ways to get through it quickly as long as you watch some adds."

The characters interactions will assist if I follow the yellow brick road. \"I can't wait to meet the wizard\" I believe I'm going to be granted more golden bricks to extend the yellow brick road. I'm curious like a lion. Lol. The best for the whole family. Thanks!",
        "This is by far the greatest game that I've ever played! A lot of my friends play as well, so I  can enjoy playing for a long time. Caution: Very addictive game!!! I find it hard to stop playing once I start. This is one app that you're going to want to download if you want to have some fun.",
        "I use to enjoy playing this game.  Lately though, there are less power ups to achieve and more of the movie tickets.  I would rather have the power ups than the tickets.  This is why I am changing the rating I previously gave of 5 stars to 3.  Also, you should really have more of the Glenda versus the Wicked Witch challenges.",
        "Great game but I really wish that daily rewards are better. It used to be you would get a crystal ball often, money and other things that to help with game, but lately it has been stuoid little rewards like two coins or one row clear. What happened to good rewards for players that come on every day and expect to get a little help in the game play",
        "I love this game except for ONE big aggravation.   When you win extended life you don't get to choose when to use it.  It starts immediately and sometimes you've been playing to complete a sprint or another section and you CANT play another two hours.   That means you lose that extra time.   Today I've lost a 3 hour extra play and now I'm about to lose another 2 hour play.   Very Annoying!"

Fun game, but the gold farming and inattentiveness to what the users want will ruin it. Great game, lots of potential if taken in the right direction, but WAY to glitchy.",
        "Like most other games, there is too much effort to bait you into micro transactions. The older games were so much better. It's a shame the Devs have resorted to such money grabbing standards.",
        "Kinda annoying game. Teammates won't go after the ball and watching ads sometimes doesn't let you try again.                 Season 3 level 76 is impossible I pass to my guy and he doesn't bother to move a finger.",
        "I like the tactic aspect of it, pretty good time waster. Took me a while to beat it, but didn't have to spend a dollar to do it. The story itself is very unrealistic and after 15 seasons I completely stopped following it and focused only on the games.",
        "Physics are stupid. You pass a high ball to your teammate. A good accurate pass. And the defender wins the header bc your teammate doesn't event jump for the header. Annoying. Also the goalie makes literally humanly impossible saves at times. He can take one step only and move across the goal and block your shot. This game needs real life human physics",
        "What is the problem with this app? In one of your levels you say that I have to hit a goal in 6 kicks or fewer and I have to assist with my hero,when I try doing it, you just make angles that make me pass in the opposite direction and my hero is in the defence and after 1 pass my hero just remains in the defence and that's  why I do not have enough stars to unlock the next season and there are a lot of problems in the other levels also.Please improve it or give me a free season unlock or give me some free stars for every season"

        "The good:  Better than WB1 where the same words kept showing up throughout even at difficult levels.  It's also nice that it shows your previous progress in a puzzle after you're forced to clear/restart it.  And although you'll still see lots of words that aren't part of the answer, the puzzles are themed so you can ignore those non-answers.  The bad:  The ads are very loud and you can't always silence them before they play.  It does not remember your sound choice so don't even think about playing this in the library.  Also, the game now has a ridiculous background that obfuscates the answer boxes making the game almost unplayable.  Finally, there are way too many boringly easy puzzles that you have to go through before you get to see the fun ones.  I almost uninstalled before getting there.",

        "This last update has broken a major part of the game. Spirit Rest runs rely on speed and now it seems after 10-15 minutes (of inactivity, in an idle game) the game becomes unresponsive until you force close and restart, potentially losing what progress you had made. I know this is an implementation to stop bots but it has only made the game more cumbersome than ever before for living players. Please reverse this Ekkorr! Surely you can find some other way to combat bots without placing such a heavy burden on the rest of us.",

        "This game is very fun and addicting. My only complaint is there isn't enough variation in the astromons. Some of them you can tell they are based off of a certain elemental character that's say...water but then the fire version is the same looking just red instead of blue. It's strange. Maybe change up how they look a bit more like in Pokemon with all of eevee evolutions. But then again it's a free game and I have been having a blast playing it. Thank you.",
        "As a beginner in the game, all the interaction menus and stuff you need to get to, or just wanna check out, take way to long to get to, as they're complicated and hold a lot of the game in them. It'd be great if there were an easier way to figure out what they do, to get the most out of the game as a newbie, instead of going through 30 tutorials of their own to find out. Otherwise, I love the gameplay, characters, and art. Great game all in all.",
        "It's nice overall. But you gotta spend a lot if you want 5 star units. I already did 3-4 600 gem summons and everytime they just give you 1 4stars unit the rest are 2 and 3 stars even when they say 'chances up'.",
        "Please fix the constant crashing during clan battles. Other than that its a wonderful games. Also it's becomes harder get gold as you level up which sucks. I love the game. Cute astromon, Wonderful evolutions, and even a nice story!",
        "so I have been playing this game for awhile now and the only major flaw I have found is that if you choose to pay for astrogems they are ridiculous expensive for pretty much nothing. I understand it is probably so it doesn't come as a pay to win game but ya. Also I wish appearance rates for rares and up for better.  I love this game. Really not an understatement. It's the perfect time killer and for me I doesn't get old. The only thing I would change is on the hard and extreme levels I wouldn't have the astromon revert to their original forms after you catch them.",
        "There is no other game that I have ever found quite like Monster Super League. It's fun to play, the monsters have great designs, and while spending real world money is an option, it's not required to progress. And progressing without spending money is easy. I wish there were more games like this one out there."

Sure there is a point where there is a wall, but at least you know your one of the strongest. Plus it makes me want to climb that wall, and topple whales.",
        "Maybe one of the best games that still let you play to win. You can get everything with enough patience and a little luck. If you do want to pay though, it's gonna be pretty expensive and the stuff you get does not really let you advance a lot (unless you actually spend A LOT of money).",
        "+ Easy to play + Good story line + Also easy to get the items + I like the game mechanic  - Need more challenging on battle - Need table of hero type - Inventory items don't include the gear being use  Overall i like this game, very good. Also, more hero will make this game more good. And... adding charge chain attack will be awesome  Edit: After update my account was lost, please fix it",
        "This game is great. It doesnt beat you over the head with paywalls, you could probably play f2p and still have a ton of fun. Graphics are good and mechanics are deep and satisfying. Only complaint is the reddit coommunity, but cant blame the devs for that.",
        "Previous rating was üëçüëç. Now üëç.  Content drought at the end of the game with some very expensive in app purchases. End game is killing the same dragon or farming the same level over and over and over...there are daily tasks which are a chore. Hoping for quality of life improvements similar to what the reddit suggests.   I really like the art style.",
        "Great game with the most responsive and generous developers.  The only thing bad about this game is the toxic gaming community.  Full of unjustifiable whiners who are so poor they need their freebies for EVERY event or else they have a hissy fit and threaten to quit game AND also cry koz of nerfs on their heroes and threaten to quit(but really don't). They also attack every person who does spend for the game (casual spender or whale) God-forbid the devs need to also earn for a living."

        "I have 89 power ups and cannot use them. This is the most ridiculous thing I have ever seen in a bingo game, it's cheating. Ok so they put up power ups that I don't have and want me to buy them.Here's the kicker, if I don't buy them it stays up the whole game and doesn't let me use the ones I have!!!!! Ahhh greed! What a joke. Absolutely unfair. I've never seen anything like it. So so sad. And now since the new update it takes way too long to level up!! They just more greedy with each update. Again, so, so sad.",
        "Pricey to play on a consistent basis. Also at last number called, give us a second or so to touch screen. Lost many BINGO's that way. Makes it seem unfair to me...",
        "I really love the concept of completing puzzles, different quests and special side games. The graphics are great as well. I don't, however, like that you're almost forced to pay for tickets or you can play MAYBE one game a day. Needless to say, I'm not spending money to boost up my tickets.",
        "Game freezes and I always lose my tokens. Not fun. I dont play for days to save just to play 2 stupid games",
        "I like this game better than any other bingo app I've tried and I've tried a lot. However the French accent in Paris is pretty bad.",
        "If you are not on a super high speed connection, or buy $100's in power ups or tickets dont plan on getting too far on this gamw.... it lags and doesnt let u bingo if you haven't purchased from the app!!!"

I didn't give it a 5 stars because of some of the programing actions available. The waypoints are sometimes more trouble than they are worth. The programmation is limited to 24 hrs. A ruler would be very useful for projections over 24 hrs. But I am enjoying myself, even if my wife doesn't understand why I should wake up at 4 am to check my course.",
        "A good improvement. My only beef is it cost money to change your boat colour. Be prepared to spend if you need to win. Find a few friends to race against and have fun without spending. Since last update keeps eating auto sail cards but only stays on for a few mimutes",
        "Getting close to perfection, need to keep the update of wind to closer to ugrib actual, but very happy with true effect and updates, like the new features of wind display, much better for present and future course determination.  Please look to make driving dial a bit larger, and a bit less sensitive, and possibly a 1 degree up or down feature, like the arrows  but a +1 or minus 1, as feature on present dial is too sensitive and does not adjust so refined.  From a Canadian point of view, can you look to include some races like Vic-maui, Transpac or even more amazing and local to west coast of North America, races such as Swiftsure or Southern Straights... short but very technically sweet races that are very challenging.",
        "Shame you can buy your way to the front of the fleet otherwise good fun.  So I have crossed the finish line 3 time but just keeps saying I have run aground ?? Hopeless",
        "Is lots of fun and surprisingly addictive.  I do mostly just the Volvo Ocean Race.  Would be nice to have an option to overlay exclusion zones.  Don't need to be enforceable, but more fun for those trying to beat the actual fleet.",

        "I'm a big mahjong player and this game is like mahjong on crack. i definitely recommend it to my fellow mahjong nerds. it's awesome with how many levels there are and boosters and achievements and the whole shebang. not just a regular mahjong game where you can only play the game and nothing more. if you like the whole saving up crystals and buying boosters and earning achievements jawn, then you'll love this game. side note, I also have not spent real life money on this game mostly because I don't need to. I usually will buy stuff for games only because I use the money I get from my Google rewards app cause that money goes straight into my Google play account. so it's not that I'm anti spending money on games, but I haven't yet felt like I needed to. it's not one of those where you need to spend money to have it be fun at all (well, not yet anyway! hopefully that won't change) or to be able to get past a certain point. so I totally recommend this to all my mahjong nerd brothers and sisters!",
        "It is a shame that this game allows one to start a new mod and a day or two later sends the player back to the original mod to collect hats, lanterns or eggs. A more polite end to an uncompleted game would be \"Try Again!\" rather than \"You lose!\" This the most rude end that I have seen on any of these games.",
        "So far its good! Just wish you would not link all your games like you do it bogs the games down. And wish you would fix it so that if you had a game several years ago in which you used your email address you could reuse it even if you can't remember your password",
        "A different spin on the classic MahJong game. It's fast-paced  and sometimes it doesn't respond as quick as I  would like. I wish the game would allow just a little more time because it is difficult to see the different levels to find all the matching tiles.",
        "I love this game. However I do have problems with the loading. It says there is no internet connection which is not true. I have fast ADSL and it is connected all the time. Why don't I have problems with other games then? They all work perfectly. Please look into this matter. Thanking you.",
        "I paid 1.99 for 40 eggs and game earned the other 5... and the \"unique prize\" was 5 gems.... I would think it would be something a little more...idk just more. Other than that, the game is awesome. Love the whole idea. Levels, like any other of the \"saga\" games with mahjong."

        "Loved this game. The game is so addictive and enjoyable. I think the best ever football game to come across. BUT I HAVE ONE PROBLEM WITH THIS GAME. AFTER BUYING COMPETITIVE SQUAD THE GAME BECOMES SO EASY SUCH THAT I WIN BY A MARGIN OF 10 GOALS PER GAME. SO KINDLY, KINDLY.. DEVELOP TWO LEAGUES WHERE TO WIN A GAME SOMEONE MUST SWEAT even if you have all players rated 90%.hope for consideration during next update.",
        "There's always a bug when there's about to be substitution of players causing the players in possession of the ball to run like headless chicken. Pls fix that. Add SULLEY MUNTARI of Deportivo La Coruna to the game pls. 'Need FTS18 with embedded dream league soccer ffs! Seems many players who have their current teams in the game are missing. Lawrence Ati of Sochaux in Ligue 1, Joe Dodoo, and many more. A quick update with massive changes will be great 'cause the game currently sucks!!!",
        "DLS is one of the best games on Android. Just need some improvement in training mode, Training is full of bugs. And where is Ball change mode?? Please add new stylish Match Balls. AND PLEASE ADD NEW CELEBRATIONS IN NEW STYLE!! Need more realistic Gameplay. Really hope that you guys fix all small bugs soon. I'll rate 5 Stars!! ‚ù§üëèüëè",
        "Everything is good. But one thing. I have 6 created players in my team and I don't get new players for 5-6 season. Please make a \"Create a Player\" option under 'My Club' menu with more player editing options with a base rating of 60 or 70. Please add this feature then only I can create players same as the local leage in my region. It'd be so nice if you add that.",
        "Look what I experienced. Dls needs development. The commentry needs more reasonableness and intelligence. The behaviour of each player, at least the famous ones should be unique. Controls need more improvement. Add real team logos for the opponent teams. Update players team data according to the recent transfers. And one more issue, while playing local multiplayer we need an extra device to connect two phones. This is a bad experience. If we can connect with each other simply by connecting wifi and hotspot of the two phones respectively, it would be great and simple.",
        "It is a brilliant game absolutely loved it. But it cud add something first can it have every player's data like if i bought neymar then can it in records give his number of goals, assists, appearances and second after every player's stats that his pitch map how many interception he did and etc not just motm bur every player"

        "I love this game! Its BEYOND ADDICTIVE! There is no Methadone to cure or lure one away from the graphics, variety of bonus games or ever changing levels that erase reality and become the Pied Piper as its classical music lures one into its universe of gaming. This is a \"slot,\" which appeals to those who also enjoy a nether-universe of of scifi/fantasu. Its visually appealing, as well as, fun!!!! An AWESOME SITE!!!",
        "Yes it looks and sounds amazing. But short of that, this slot game is completely unremarkable. Just like every other slot game out there, wins are few and far between. The hourly bonus is weak aswel. When you're at a level that requires you to max bet (25000000 or more) and you win 1000000 on the hour bonus and have nothing in the credit meter due to the lack of free spins and no bonuses, it becomes very frustrating. Install if you're easily entertained by graphics and sound, because thats seriously the only thing you will get from this.",
        "THE PLOTS(NOT SLOTS,LOL)ARE THE BEST ,GRAPHICS ARE GREAT AND YOUR NOT JUST PLAYONG A SLOT,YOU ARE REALLY IN TO THE GAMES!!!!! I HAVE TO SAY IT JUST GETS BETTER AND MORE INVOLVED THE MORE YOU PLAY. THANK YOU.10+!It just gets better and better!!!!! Love it more and more!! thanks again THEY KEEP ME  EAGER TO GET TO THE NEXT ROUND OF  PLAY.   KEEP  THEM COMING. THANK YOU",
        "Used to be fun and worth maybe occasionally spending a few bucks on. Now early levels easier but struggle to ever get past first 3 levels. Seems to be just about getting you to spend real money now. Better have your big boy wallet or not worth installing. Really too bad.",
        "This is the best online slots game ever.  This game has so many awesome graphics and great prizes for everyone playing.  Thanks Murka for keeping for the last 2 years of  my sleeplessness nights soooo very interesting!!!!!  Luv ya bunches....waiting for more to come.....",
        "I love the graphics and the slot games, I really enjoy playing, but by level 70 some of the missions are just completely ridiculously high and for me that takes away some of the enjoyment, eg. Spin 700 times on max bet - that is just too much. How about give more variety of challenges rather than making them too hard to achieve or too long winded."

        "Over engineered upgrades which are clearly done as a gold mine for DroidHen. Result is you either pay to win or massive grind. Defender II was more balenced in this regard but still a huge grind too. I think World Raid is a myth since it has never worked. It apperently lasts about 30 second but I don't know since it mostly throws an error. I've gotten in twice and it immediately goes to Stage Cleared with &gt;97% beast life left.",
        "Bug that you have to wait endlessly to enter daily raid seems to be partially fixed. But: 1. Raid is even more fraudulent than before...no mattet you defense, dragon will one hit you. Fraud, there is no reason for a mechanic you cannot do anything about except exploitation! 2. I have all the upgrades and do pretty much max dmg, but there seem to be people out there that do 20 times the amount I do...except they don't, because they simply DO NOT EXIST!!! AS IN BATTLE MODE THEY ARE SIMPLY MADE UP BY THE DEVS! THEY ARE NOT ACTUALLY REAL PLAYERS!!! 3. The skill that decreases % of all dmg does not do so...it virtually does not reduce damage at all, but still it costs 50 crystals per % point. Also fraud! 4. You pay for somethin but you cannot keep it. If you change your phone, everything is lost forever! This is criminal behaviour! CONCLUSION: Probably the most fraudulent and criminal organisation out there. BEWARE AND DO NOT INSTALL, AND FOR CHRISTS SAKE, DON'T SPEND MONEY ON IT!!!",

        "After the latest update, I've only gotten one set of daily quests which populated right after the update. After that, I haven't received any additional daily quest where I can win some gems. Why is that? Now the only way for me to earn more gems os through the free gems  (by watching adds), getting a high enough ranking in battlez, or buying them.",
        "I think the new update is nice battlez is awesome and the good news is that my phone doesnt crashes anymore and when I played Inzanity it did'nt lag great rework but 1 question, WHY DID YOU REMOVE ULTIMATE BATTLE AND DEMONSTRATION MINI GAME THEMES TO EVERY WORLD?? Im sick of every level with just only themes",
        "I think the new update is very cool. It adds some multiplayer into the game. When I heard of this new update I rushed to my phone and started playing. It turned out to be good I was happy and thought it would turn out well. Then after that I remembered pvz one. It's multiplayer mode was much better. One player would be plants and the other zombies. Why could they not have made that. It was such a good idea. I would personally play that mode more than this. But it's just my opinion. Thanks for reading.",
        "Since last update it is very unstable and keeps crashing. Also every time i finish the last inzanity it crashes then once reloaded says expired so ive lost out. In fact im not that interested anymore. Im not a fan of battlez and it all seems geared to that now so had fun while it lasted.",
        "I HATE YOUR UPDATE. Battlez mixed battle between players who bought plants with money with the players who don't is totally unfair. There are many players out there like me who play everyday collecting coins by coins and gems by gems patiently waiting for a good plant offer that we can buy with gems. Buying plants with money is not on the budget. I'm not angry. I'm sad. Because PVZ is always one of my top listed games. Now it's pathetic. Crashed. Unfair. Expensive.",
        "Just like.But EA just want money right? You just wasting money.Money cause something bad.This wirld need to follow the truth path.Not money path.I dont like those plant,pinatas and more that need to buy with money.Useless."

        "I love this game. It's very dynamic and the gameplay is good too. The only problem I have is every single time I do PvP... It pairs me with an opponent far greater than what I can hope to beat. Sure, that's great for improving, but it disheartens me and makes me feel like a horrible player when I can't even beat ONE PvP opponent, ever, while playing the game. I would suggest to the devs that the matching system be a little more flexible when pairing. Give us a matching system that will actually give us lesser prepared players too so we can have the fun of winning, as well. Also, I am disconnected every single time I do PvP battles and bounties. Quite unstable, unfortunately.",
        "Amazing shooter game, awesome hero collecting game, great multiplayer game. Definitely suggest that you at least try it out. But one thing you should look out for, it's pretty easy to sink between 5 and 20 dollars a week into this. Sometimes even 40 to 60. But, it's pretty free-to-play friendly if you can't afford to buy some gold.",
        "I really like the game. It's fun and has enough activities and quests to keep you occupied for a while. My only complaint is how they match people up for the PVP missions. Sometimes you get matched up with people with far higher power and Team level menu which makes it nearly impossible to win. other than that I really enjoy the game",
        "Super fun game. I haven't got bored of the game because there's always events going on which is good. One of the better if not the best shooting game I've played. I think there is a slight glitch when using Steele. Sometimes after I activate his open fire skill he doesn't shoot when I press the shoot button.",
        "Latest update definitely made the game harder. I used to run 4 gauntlet levels with little issue but now I can't get through 1 without losing people. Resurrected characters are completely unwelcome and unfair in pvp when you tell on kills for money. Probably going to uninstall, you're welcome for the money Hothead",
        "Starts off ok but then the pay walls creep in and you are constantly bombarded with prompts to spend money. The PVP is absolutely pointless, highest power rating wins every time without exception so you know if you've won or lost as soon as it picks an opponent. Needs a lot of work before I'd consider dropping any real money on it."

Sounds fun, huh?  While the graphics and general gameplay are ok, more and more, its becoming pure pay to win, fighting is way out of balance.  I wound recommend this game until they fix it.",
        "This game has a great concept. But unless you can buy multiple things through the game you get nowhere. You can build up all you want but during certain events you go into the nagative. There is no gamemanship in it just money.",
        "Game play sucks. There is no true info to what you really want ro know about this game or on the net. No way to defend yourself solo. Unless your an idiot and spend money on free, I would not waste time on this game. Ember needs to patch a whole bunch of problems with this game. The game will most of the time always crash when you go to adventure mode or to the dungeons. Look else where, don't waste your time on this one!",
        "It is definitely a money game, it is for people who can afford to spend money to gain the power rule and do away with the ones that can't. It glitches a lot and support will not respond. If they do, its a standard letter that may or may not answer what you are asking. Hmmm maybe a computer.  I dropped down to a 1 they continue to lag, the last 4 heros you have to buy. Instead of fixing the problems,  they are just making sure people who just want to play have fun and spend small amounts of money will be eliminated.  I know of 2 realms that are already dead. There are only 5 realms, this should tell you something. Unless you can afford to put the price of a house into this game, it wont be fun for you. It has now gone to bullying people into leaving the game, you complain  support ignore these complaints  yes war game, bully no 7/24 ke cant farm, cant grow without permission of the bullys and developers  dont care so sad",
        "This game should look after games like lord mobile or Vikings clan war  They add option little by little to become more like them If they do that fast enough then this game is great  I prefer some thing more on this game like troop level 5 Alllll game like this has only t4 Be normal and Do something more then normal to gain more fan",
        "Not telling you where an attack came from has ruined an already flawed game.  Definite glass ceiling to it.  Is fun until level 35, then it just feels like you are stuck in mud with random folks destroying your castle."

        "Good graphics. Good units. Awesome skills. Nice drawings. All in all, this is a really good game üòÅüëçüëåBut I have a problem. It keeps stopping everytime I open it. And I've also been addicted to this game for more than a month now üòÑ",
        "It's been a year since I've last played this, still fun. I've been playing this from day to night as far as I could remember. Hopefully, the bugs where the downloading restarts are solved. Nice Gameply as ever, getting hooked to this once again.",
        "This game is fun and addictive. I like that you don't have to work very hard to get decent leveled characters, and having everyone be overpowered makes the game fun. My only problem is how multiplayer is a little wonky sometimes, mainly when the app suddenly freezes during a battle.",
        "Feels satisfying and stress-free , cute characters too. I just have one problem, when it gives me a notifications of free polygons or similar to that, I go check but I don't get anything. There appears nothing in my giftbox.",
        "Great graphics and music and very f2p friendly for a gachapon game. Lots of banners with guaranteed top tier units so if you follow the Discord or Reddit community's advice on when to pull, you can make the free gems go a long way. The more characters you have, the more quests you can do to get more characters, so it may seem slow in the beginning but eventually your character collection will snowball until you have more waifus than you know what to do with!"

I love the easy gameplay and the graphics, The only problem I have with it is how hard I is to get ninja pearls without money, I'm young and dont have a credit card or job yet so I miss quite a few opportunities. I highly recommend to any Naruto fans.",
        "This game is very great and can be addicting. The only problem u have is that when ever I try to play a mission it always says there is a communication error. I would really like to keep playing the game, so if there is anything you could do about it- that would be great.",
        "your servers are bad.. trying to hunt Chino but 2 times already when we finish the last map and i see the yellow card of the last boss, then i get connection lost and don't get a thing in the end.. it is really frustrating to play for 15 minutes, see your goal fulfilled but then.. nooooo, you don't get the cards in the end",
        "I love the game, but during multi-player, especially in impact missions, let us continue even if player 1 gives up. It's extremely annoying when you play to the boss, and their hp is very low,  and player 1 leaves and all that time was for nothing. Let player 2 and 3 continue, even if player 1 and 3 or 1 and 2 quit, let that last player control the other two. That's the only improvement I can think of for the next update.",
        "I'm only putting it as one star in hopes the devs see this, but please find a better way to recover accounts. I've been a fan of this game for years and when I logged in I was logged out, I have no idea what my transfer info is because I've only had to do that once. I don't want to just start over, please find a better way for people to get their accounts back once your update logs them out.",
        "It's not the best game but because I am a fan of naruto my interest in this game might be different than others would think. Overall its a decent mobile game but it could use some more improvements."

I will update my review with 5 stars when the game us updated again to the way it was.",

They sent me an email today for me to uninstall the game and reinstall it and that they said should fix the issues.

This use to be one of my favorite games but on Android it still is fun but to many bugs and like I said CUSTOMER SERVICE SUCKS"

        "Love this game but when you are competing with SWGOH for mobile SW content I expect it to be better end game and more Special events. At lvl 8 and there's no more rewards or incentives , so I guess I'm done.   Also, As a busy person I have limited time to play and taking the entire game offline for maintenance, like right now is not a good way to keep me interested.  Dumb move devs.   Edit: good job with update but still need light and dark missions past level 7",
        "You should be matched with someone in your Tier, not 4 Tiers above you. When you play against fellow Guild Members you shouldn't have your levels edited. There should be an option to leave matches during the match. It doesn't make sense to lose because you had something else to do. And here's my biggest problem \"Oh hey, you won that match, here's 30 points.\" \"Oh you lost that match? Lemme just have 51 points from you.\" It also doesn't make sense to have heroes with blasters against melee heroes. They end up at a disadvantage.  Fot example, I was just matched with a level 3 Kylo Ren, as a level One Padme. Sooo fair.",
        "First the unbalance between the factions. Now the match making.. Are you folks fckng serious about it? Your matching a lvl 11 to 13 or 14? How could I win with my lvl 10 troops vs lvl 15 troops? No matter which side I play.. I have a lvl 3 hux and your great system matches me to a lvl 5 anakin with lvl 13 af walkers? Tell me this is a joke.",
        "Won't let me put cards down at mid Battle again and again. Connection will slow you down not your opponent it seems run into this issue way to much. Then issues like won't let you move or play anything but energy goes up",
        "Absolutely love this game. As a life-long Star Wars fan this ticks NEARLY all of the boxes. However, there is one thing that bothers me, hence the \"nearly\". And that is the matchmaking. I'm in tier 5 division 3, and for some reason it decides to pick a person from tier 7 division 2. Of course, I lost because it's unfair. Please sort this out.",
        "My favorite game on mobile right now. It's a mix between a MOBA(League of Legends)  and Clash Royale. You control a hero AND manually deploy different troops in your lane. I've never spent a dime and own all the heroes in game so it is not really pay to win at all. All around great game."

        "This game is so lopsided. Long losing streaks. Waiting for 1 card to make a good meld, meanwhile my opponent is pulling them out right and left. I can be 2 points away from winning and they just pull 2 melds out of their hat for a win. Uninstalling! Make your game fun.",
        "So... if this isn't a scam... how can I quit a game before it's over and immediately be paired with the same opponent. Every time I've had an opponent drop out, it takes a few seconds to notify me they left the game. Every day a new reason to NOT pay a cent for this fraud. I play out of sheer boredom.",
        "Players with higher ranks should not be able to play  against players that are lower rank with less experience. Plus the ring challenge if you don't reach  the 30000 you should get the amount that it stops on, instead of 1000 points.",
        "Want to love this game, but it just constantly cheats!! It would be more enjoyable if you could have so many free plays per log in to just enjoy some play, like other games do. Instead you run out of gems right away after being cheated out of one or two games, which really stinks!!  I'm not paying through the nose just to enjoy playing a game. You are too greedy and a big fat CHEAT King and it has really disappointed me, because the game would be great fun if I could actually play it!!!",
        "Uninstalling...too many hiccups! Costs too much too play a simple game of cards. This game is all about making a lot of money for 'King' corporation. Can't really say anything nice about this game. Pretty much agree with the reviews. (didn't even have installed for 24 hrs.)",
        "I agree with the cheating and everything everyone else is talking about, but I also have a problem with the automatic card shuffle in the middle of your turn. Wait for the players turn to end, then shuffle.  I have lost several games because of this.  I now have a 3 lose rule because of the way this game messes with you and then I'm out and won't play for days or weeks, because I refuse to pay for a game that cheats."

There hasn't been any updates or new venues for a long time so think the game is being phased out. The game is free but you do need to buy gold with hard cash to progress. No longer worth downloading, my advice is to find something else to play.",
        "It is an awesome game. It is very addictive and I feel very invested in it. If you don't want to spend any of your real money to buy gold, you sure don't need to. It takes a hell lot more to get everything you want but it's still playable. It has some bugs, sure, specially regarding your wireless connecting but it's nothing major. The levels are really hard sometimes but makes up for the good challenge. Thanks, devs, for the awesome game",

The only thing I don't like is when you spend your supplies to play even when you win you still lose those supplies to play instead of keeping your supplies so you can continue to play on. Other then that. It's amazing. So download this app and have some fun today, tomorrow, or whenever you have some past time. Thanks Chef Ramsay.",
        "I love the game. But there's some bug issues like   1) login to claim 10golds - didn't happen. Where'd the gold? 2) now I can't even login to social. It keep loading, then kinda leave it at that.   I would rate it 5 stars once this is resolved. It's really getting on my nerves.",
        "Game could be cool but has way too much stuff crammed into the tiny screen of most phones. Graphics need to be simplified so that you can see things easier. Overall, the game freezes and crashes every time I try to play. Spend more time making this game stable and easy to see and it might be more fun.",

This has kept me from being able to do anything with the game for nearly a week. I've missed out on events and opportunities to move up on leaderboards. Please fix the app. I enjoy the game and I don't want to lose progress because of a technical error."

        "Excellent storyline, graphics, and doesn't waste your time with ads. This is how the e type of games should be done. The only thing that would make it better is if they actually gave out gems. This is their 1 downfall - not receiving any gems at all. Therefore, you are forced to either buy them or select the choice you didn't really want in order to get the free choice. This, of course, changes your storyline. However, you can see at the end of each episode the percentage of your choices compared with other users and its normally in the 90 percentile. Still this is a wonderful game that I would highly recommend.",

        "The game is great.. Awesome graphics and ideas.. Would be nice if there are more players. There are many servers but less players.. Maybe you guys can merge the servers? So there would be more players. Also if avatar emojis features were there, it would be fun to intract with players, like sitting, crying, sleeping, like those in age of wushu.. Other than that This is an awesome game.. Better than age of wushu for me.. And also very addicting..love it.. Hoping for an update..",
        "Great graphic but u need to work on the gameplay more as well. The gameplay doesnt seem very...natural,and u gotta have an option where u can disable \"auto\" for players who dont wanna use that feature.",
        "Hey idiots who complain about auto.  Here's a tip:  Don't use it.  Great game, needs more players.  When going to a quest or npc, there should be an arrow pointing us in the right direction, which will let us enjoy flight mode more, manually.  Servers need merged.",

        "I love the game as well as Age of Wushu and Sword of Romance, now the only problem i have is that my cellphone gets super hot, I can not touch the screen and have to let the game rest until i can play again. If you can fix this issue that would be great. But thanks for having English version of games like this.",
        "it's fun, but i think they need to improve PvP arena from auto mode only to free control mode, and hope they will make more new bosses. this game is fun and don't need too much RAM and ROM hope this game will have more active player"

        "Smurfymurf.  Now that's a Smurf! Did they ever mean something to you? Then you just have to get it ! Super nice!!! And technically very well done too !!!   Oooooooooops !!!! Update few days later...   Suddenly the game keeps crashing randomly...   Tried it for days....   Can hardly survive a single level now...    Very sad....   The game itself is still excellent....   Maybe a later update brings a fix..................",
        "This is by far one of the best games I have played like this all year. Very addicting, easy, but challenging enough to keep you wanting to come back play some more. Haven't found something I don't like about this game just yetüòÅ",
        "Fun game, my daughter enjoys playing. ..easy, yet challenging at the same time.  One irritating issue...every time there's an update, or just opening the app, turns on the game's notifications..and have to turn it off constantly. ..otherwise it would be a rare 5 star rating from me.",
        "You can't get anywhere unless you actually use money to buy the power ups to bet the levels. It's a waste of space for any device",
        "Hate it. Too difficult. No helping aid. Not funny, but stressful. I left the game at level 83. Why you made it ugly like this?",
        "Like with all other games this game is rigged, once you get to a certain level you are set up to fail unless you buy coins. I don't play games so I can go broke on coins, I don't like this."

However, the game is not balanced for casual players and the development put a huge emphasis on pay to play. If you want to climb you really have to give up your life and keep climbing, and pay so you can simply redo your skills as you gain more. Hard to justify committing so much time.",

        "Great idle game that you can play as much or as little as you want, even if you only have a few minutes. My only gripe is all the inactive guilds. Finding a guild with an active guild master is virtually impossible, and when the gm quits all guild upgrading is over. It's also frustrating that all the upgrades you earn for a guild stay with the guild so if your guild master comes back after 6 months and kicks you, you get to start from scratch with no bonuses.",
        "This game is actually really good. Not as confusing as the picture shows. Lots to explore.   The only thing I would change for a 5 star it to not stop us from battling after 1 hour of playing.  Hypecrafter NX youtuber Sighing out.",
        "I am not able to access the members list after the upgrade, please fix this problem. I have too many inactive players I have to kick out. Kindly fix this asap",
        "great game, but one of the advertisements with a game in it caused my game to crash, and now i get nothing from watching the advertisements, I'd suppose because its still waiting for a reply from the advert. it was a casino advertisement with 3 buttons, and it led me to the top one. other than that, the app is good. definitely didn't expect an attack from the tribe of stretchy nipples.",

        "This game was absolutely perfect and was very much enjoyable, but now to unlock the full experience you have to pay. One of the reasons I enjoy this game and recommended it to my friends is because it is one of the only games that isn't locked behind a paywall. Overall, I have had countless hours playing this game, and trying to land on everything and return successfully. Instead of the microtransaction, why not institute a merit-based system for unlocking parts?",
        "Very great!  Here are a few suggestion from me to make your game more enjoyable :)  1. Can you please make the earth scale correctly because its diameter is around 12.000 km and moon orbit is around 380.000 km  2. Please make a smaller powerful engine like the 9 engines of the falcon 9  3. Please make a button that is simple to cycle from another rocket to another one to ease the attempt of landing a booster  4. Please add an ocean on the earth for some splashdown  5. The last one. Im a free 2 play player and i cant enjoy a majority of the new update :*(",
        "This game is awsome. Loads of fun. Told my friends about it. Could you add a free sandbox mode and more free parts. Thanks. Keep up the good work. Shouldn't have added micro transactions. It just ruined the game for me. Had to take it from a 5 star to a 3 star. Please bear this comment in mind for future updates. This game was 100% free when i downloaded it in december last year. Since then, you added a new build system, free parts which make the game absolutely amazing, and then you add pay for parts. Thats just buzzkill.",
        "Very fast and simple rocket building and great graphics. I wish there was a sandbox mode with infinite fuel. Also there is no indication for loading screens when you hit the launch button. Somethimes you think you tapped the button and end up sitting there for a minute or two wasting time.  Edit So glad they made a small payment option. Well worth the money and glad to support",
        "Great!  Only thing I miss is the ability to rendezvous and dock with another object.  In a moon landing, you could leave a stage in lunar orbit and pick it up for the outbound burn.  Also, karman line should be 100 km??  Edit:. Great updates.  I have no idea how to use docking to reattach parts that have been undocked though.",
        "Can you please add option to center the map on the rocket/vehicle when being in the map mode? It is difficult to switch between near objects in the current version, since I assume the map is stationary relative to the body in which influence sphere we're in at that moment. Also, a \"docking guide\" would be cool in some future update"

        "Tactical monsters is a great turn based strategy game. There's enough complexity to make it interesting but not so much that it's overwhelming. It has both single and multiplayer game mode options as well as fun challenges. Collecting cards is addicting and fun. Warning, it makes you want to play  more! One of my favorite things game is how fast it is. Battles are quick but still enjoyable. It is possible to do well in this game without paying. One last thing I like about this game is the support. The developers are constantly updating the game and fixing issues.",
        "Great game, but after the last update the game isn't stable, when you play pvp often the timer freezes and you can't do anything beside closing the game, or you just cant do any action, and then you miss your turn, please fix it, and I'll give it 5 stars because the game is really awesome. Problem solved!",
        "i uninstalled the game but i made sure to bound my account to googleplay however when i installed the game again i cant get my previous progress and have to start over again please fix this.... Overall the game is really good for people who like to play strategically.",
        "For a game called tactical monsters, I was unpleasantly surprised that most units are actually humans and not monsters. Fighting is very basic with only having melee and ranged arrows. No magic, no way to buff allies, not many choices in combat. Overall a very boring and lackluster tactics wanna be type game. Hexes for movement are also very small and no back button to take back moves. I would not recommend playing this on a phone at all- Reply to Camex Games: First, try using spell check next time. Second - I did play several missions past the \"tutorial\" and none of the units given had magic or skills that opened up the game past a hack n slash. Third - Its not my problem to play dozens of hours in your mediocre phone game waiting for it to get interesting. If your game isn't good within the first hour, no one wants to keep playing for the next 10 hours. Fourth - how many monsters you have hidden in the game is irrelevant, as the units you get at the beginning of the game are mostly human, in a game called Tactical MONSTERS. Fifth - Giving monsters 3 basic skills that don't offer much tactical option when you can't customize them, isn't interesting. Sixth -- Add a back button",
        "Game is awesome! One of the best tactics game I ever played, and I play those a lot. Would be a great implement if we could zoom in or out during battle, and also some little story on campaign would make it more enjoyable. 4.9*",
        "I can't open game it go on 100 and then say network problem so fix it my all friend are playing this game and reach much higher and my game is not starting üò¢üò¢ plz plz plz fix it for me if no then sorry I had to uninstall it"

        "I wasnt sure about this series at first, but it's really grown on me. The unique art style, interesting characters and immersive world make this an incredible game, especially considering it's a free mobile app! I would definitely love to see more sims like this in the future, (especially with the bad boy type). Seeing it transfer to desktop would be awesome! Overall, everything about this game is wonderful but, like everyone else says, the amount of energy given for free isn't enough! I think it would be wise to either lower the cost of energy actions take, give more free energy out, or split the story into parts in which 1 part can be played for free each day. Other than that it's a great sim!",
        "My absolute favorite of all of the Is it Love games. Colin is an amazing character with an equally amazing backstory, and the way he connects with the MC is just incredible. The twists and turns in each chapter leave me craving more of the story. The energy they give you is somewhat lacking, but I'm used to it by now. Highly reccomend!",
        "Really don't like how the guy treats the girl, what a scumbag! Plus I've been playing for over a week and the plot is unbelievably slow, the energy doesn't last long enough. There are much better otome style games out there.",
        "Well the energy situation is beyond annoying. You only get very little for free and the prices for the energy and just WAY too expensive. I do like the story a lot though and will probably take 8 years to complete the story so I don't have to pay 50 bucks",
        "OK, so I absolutely agree with everyone that the energy you get for free is nowhere near enough & packages are too expensive for what you get. I know, I've bought many. This story particular started bad, but now that I'm at the end, I'm hooked. Please continue to update. I have lots of bought energy going to waste!!",
        "I don't really like the concept of earning energy every 24 hours. But I've got to say every time i see that message when my energy runs out. It leaves me on a cliffhanger and it keeps me in the story. Even if the energy wasn't there i would still play the game to my hearts content! Overall AMAZING story and characters!!"

This game can be very difficult, I suggest you do not just auto-battle everything.. Take some time to learn your characters and all the glyph combinations.. Its almost endless. You will enjoy this one much more!",

        "Evolution is retarded, seriously. Having to sacrifice 2 other creatures of the same level to evolve makes the game insanely difficult for noobs to get anywhere fast. Come on devs, that's just bald faced greed, try a little more finesse if you ever want to see me invest in this game.",
        "Great disappointment, when I heard that this game would come I expected something epic like heroes of might and magic V. Not this generic game that looks like all other games in the play store.",

Cost for outfits/shoes/jewlery are extremely high 189 diamonds for a dress i mean come on. Only can watch one video to earn 1 diamond thats disappointing. I'll give 5 stars if getting diamonds gets easier or mini games to get diamonds would be great.",
        "I Love this game but recently it has disappointed me. To move on to the next task I have to buy an expensive house which I can't afford (Hollywood mansion). I can't even buy the coins to afford it because the coins are so expensive too. There is no way of getting around it, I have tried making movies and moving up levels but I am always stuck with the same problem. I can't even skip the task! I am on the verge of rage quitting this game.",
        "This is the best game I have ever played. This must be the world's NO. 1 game. Please make lessen the amount of money that you have for the London Mansion. Please add more stories as I have finished all the stories (except the London Mansion). The last thing is that this game should have more updates as in my IPad there is a new version of this game. Thank you.",
        "I really do love it, but 95% of the clothing requires a ton of diamonds that are very rare and difficult to earn but when you do receive them you only get a couple. Also, it's very frustrating that searching for random objects consumes your energy. Please, PLEASE fix those.",
        "I would give it 5 steers but every time I try to go into a Beverly hills store my game crashes and I have to close the game and I try again and it keeps happening also the losing is slow. If you fix this I will give it 5. Thanks.",
        "This game is toooo Goooooood. But the dresses are very costly, no new hair styles, in spin wheel i never got 500 or 1000 diamonds, also i want to have this character a baby. Please reduce the prize of the dressed. Also London is nothing in front of a Hollywood mansion"

Mostly for gameplay, + the ability to ff thru the long cutesy bonus animations at level completion, but this game fell out of favor with me as B.B. stole it's spot with optional paid ad removal which I was happy to pay, it's not offered in this game. The ads in this game do not even close when you tap the X, instead each ad opens in Google Play at least twice before the X will actually close it. Huge waste of my time & frustration! Also B.B. let's you earn 20x the in game coins & power ups per level, daily challenge, and tourney's than this ad whoring p.o.s.   This game may be fun, but very little reward comparatively & no amount of fun is worth that ad trap hassle b.s.",

        "I reckon this game is so good! I reckon it needs a test mode track so when you finish fixing the car fully to 100% you can test it. And probably alot more cars to fix, and also instead of having just one place where there are garages. You can go all over the world to different type of country's where there are different cars like Australia has commodores, Japan of skyline etc. Love this game so much ‚ù§ hope you take this into exception",
        "Great game and efforts of game generating team are appreciated. I wld suggest to add few things like  tires wheel rims tinted glass at extra cost and if used will pay more while selling. Also sometimes when we buy car from barn in some cases few parts could be made missing so that player wld need to search and then purchase new to add more fun. After u get all tools and all cards then it is boaring....",
        "For the developers: this game is broken. I play on tablet Galaxi tab A   Start the game Remove battery Buy new battery Install new battery Cant tap the sell option Game freeze Nothing work Retart the game 5 times always the same",
        "Trying to find a support link?? I have all tools yet wont give me a bonus.... Love the game. Camera can be a pain sometimes but you learn where to and where not to touch parts. Also why not have buyers or clients stop in... Finishing a car 100% and only making 2k after putting wok into the car Then 10k into parts... I would fire the guy selling cars... Just my two cents.",
        "Nothing like the older apps like this. Camera control is hard, going from warehouse to parts catalogue constantly to remember bad parts to replace is a pain, then an add plays further impairing your memory. Disassembly  got way less interactive and so far I can't repair parts, just  purchase from a catalog.",
        "Overall the game is exactly what you think it would be, a mobile version of car mechanic simulator 2018. That being said the rotate and zoom features of the camera can be a little irritating at times. It's also very hard to make money to get to your 4th level of tools when you can't completely repair the majority of cars that you get. It can be a little frustrating to purchase a car only to realize that you cannot completely restore it."

        "Awesome game. just a few comments. you guys should have the stuff that's automatically generated (mining for example) running in the background even while the app is closed because otherwise you're just getting maybe 100 every now and then and you feel like you're getting nothing. would be nice for the money that comes every minute to also still run even while the app is off",
        "Great idle game that you can play as much or as little as you want, even if you only have a few minutes. My only gripe is all the inactive guilds. Finding a guild with an active guild master is virtually impossible, and when the gm quits all guild upgrading is over. It's also frustrating that all the upgrades you earn for a guild stay with the guild so if your guild master comes back after 6 months and kicks you, you get to start from scratch with no bonuses.",
        "This game is actually really good. Not as confusing as the picture shows. Lots to explore.   The only thing I would change for a 5 star it to not stop us from battling after 1 hour of playing.  Hypecrafter NX youtuber Sighing out.",

I will not sacrifice all the other good games I have for this single one. Now with google only allowing so many apps ( no writing to sd card). Atleast if you update you should let people keep playing with version they have. Make updates optional.",

But My 4 friends have IOS devices & their Servers are showing different than us. I don't know why? We can't even connect by number also. Tried doing that!. Please let me know its fixture",
        "It's a fun game. If you're a COD player you'll love it. In general It does good on it's own as a solid shooter. Only thing I think you really, REALLY need to change is the way to get weapons. Using rentals is great, picking up enemy or ally weapons, sure, but having to spend money to get most weapons, if not all, seems a little unfair. It's good that there's a grind to get them but I think it's a little overkill how difficult it is. I think levels should determine what you unlock, then use silver (make it easier to get) to purchase it. Or, if players want to speed up the process, use gold.",
        "I really like the game. Fun, exciting, and addictive. The only problem I have is that the rewards you get are not nearly enough as I think they should be. Exp gains are good, but cash gains are so bad and you will have to play for hours to accumulate cash and then you can buy HALF of a weapon, because they require a lot of cash to get one. You also can barely upgrade weapons without any gold and you can just forget about that unless you put some real world currency in this game, which is a real shame. As a player I know we would like to buy and upgrade our own weapons instead of having to \"rent\" which is an option in the game.",
        "this game is great, but i rated 3 star cuz i wanted this gaem to be like COD: WWII, and like ravenfield. There are NO MG nests, no war modes like COD:WWII, and please, fix the prices! It took me 3 years of full gameplay, 5 hours just to get a shotgun. And please optimize the guns. Overall, really great game!

        "Love the game. It's fun and interactive but have only hit bonuses and free spins on the first game. Been playing for awhile now and not once did I hit the Wheel of Riches or What's in the box. It's bit deceiving that you have to increase your bet to activate the Wheel of Riches or What's in the Box when it rarely or never hits. At least allow those to hit once every thousand spins or something.",
        "This game is awesome. Love the graphics, sounds, and games. Makes me smile everytime Ellen talks. Silly I know but I absolutely love Ellen and this game is amazing. My 3yo son loves taking turns with mommy and we absolutely love the bonus games! He laughs and gets excited everytime we win!!! I wish I could give it a million stars!!!! HEY ELLEN MAKE A KIDS LEARNING GAME TOO PLEASE!!!! but seriously this game is relaxing and fun! If you haven't downloaded it yet, DO IT!!!!! ‚ô°‚ô°‚ô°",
        "My mom loved you so much. She passed away Dec. 18th. She would've loved this game you have. I play in honor of her memory and well, i love you to. Been a fan since before your johnny carson appearance. Wish i could go to your show and play a game for the fun of it and to meet you. Sincerely, Tim Simpson",
        "Ellen, love the candles that light up to spell your name. Clever. The reels in your games are Hurkey jerkey. Smooth is better. Solo, where is the box in What's in the Box? Where is the reel in wheel to riches? Your pay outs are much better on max bet. Took me a while to get to 100M. Keep up the creative good work.",
        "I keep watching the ads to get extra coins and none of them get awarded. I never get the wheel of riches or multijackpots or what's in the box no matter how high I play. I've played SO MANY times on the #Imatellen one and the heart emoji is as big as it gets but I've never gotten the bonus game. These glitches are ridiculously frustrating. Honestly if they don't get fixed soon I'm just gonna delete and find a different casino app.",
        "This game is so great. I play it in my free time. Not normally a slots can but this one is so much fun. The fact that you start out with 5,000,000 dollars is awesome to me. If only those were real winnings hah !"

        "This game is very fun and addicting. My only complaint is there isn't enough variation in the astromons. Some of them you can tell they are based off of a certain elemental character that's say...water but then the fire version is the same looking just red instead of blue. It's strange. Maybe change up how they look a bit more like in Pokemon with all of eevee evolutions. But then again it's a free game and I have been having a blast playing it. Thank you.",
        "As a beginner in the game, all the interaction menus and stuff you need to get to, or just wanna check out, take way to long to get to, as they're complicated and hold a lot of the game in them. It'd be great if there were an easier way to figure out what they do, to get the most out of the game as a newbie, instead of going through 30 tutorials of their own to find out. Otherwise, I love the gameplay, characters, and art. Great game all in all.",
        "It's nice overall. But you gotta spend a lot if you want 5 star units. I already did 3-4 600 gem summons and everytime they just give you 1 4stars unit the rest are 2 and 3 stars even when they say 'chances up'.",
        "Please fix the constant crashing during clan battles. Other than that its a wonderful games. Also it's becomes harder get gold as you level up which sucks. I love the game. Cute astromon, Wonderful evolutions, and even a nice story!",
        "so I have been playing this game for awhile now and the only major flaw I have found is that if you choose to pay for astrogems they are ridiculous expensive for pretty much nothing. I understand it is probably so it doesn't come as a pay to win game but ya. Also I wish appearance rates for rares and up for better.  I love this game. Really not an understatement. It's the perfect time killer and for me I doesn't get old. The only thing I would change is on the hard and extreme levels I wouldn't have the astromon revert to their original forms after you catch them.",
        "There is no other game that I have ever found quite like Monster Super League. It's fun to play, the monsters have great designs, and while spending real world money is an option, it's not required to progress. And progressing without spending money is easy. I wish there were more games like this one out there."

        "I'm so addicted to this game! Out of all the simulation games I've played this is by far my favourite. The characters are great and the story line changes on each route so it keeps you interested. And you don't have to spend money to enjoy everything in this game. An hourglass takes a while to get but it's worth it to use them to get the extra stories. I enjoyed the Christmas add on.",
        "I LOVE this game, and everything about it is awesome, aside from the fact that I just got a new phone and now the time is correct on it (my old phone clock was an hour off), and daylight savings time just happened so while my new phone time is an hour later, my game won't let me play due to the time change. It says I need to go back to my previous time zone (which I haven't moved anywhere, its just daylight savings time). I've already put a suggestion up on your site asking about whether you guys can put an option to change the time on the game for these very situations, or to install a daylight savings time option so it can keep up with real time. Other than that though, I absolutely love the game, the graphics, the game play, and the characters to which I get so attached to, are stunning and beautiful. Y'all should be really proud of yourselves &lt;3",
        "Nice description, nice plot. Likable characters with spot on music. What more could I ask for? (Edit on 9/7: I downed the rating not because it's a bad game, but because although I had an account for this game, I lost all my data when I logged in. I had saved 270+ hourglasses so I could do the secret endings but well. That went down the toilet. I won't be trying again until I get interested (and over this) in this game again. Other than that I fully recommend this game.)",
        "Loved it overall but make the chats last longer without having to reset them as I miss them with school or sleep. Not everyone can use the app at certain times in the day. It doesn't have to last the whole day just a few more hours  or 10. The games good other than that though. It's a good way to pass the time and has a good story.Keep up the good work.",
        "Im in love wih the characters already! Though, its kinda sad that you are forced to be a girl character even if you state that you arent in game. That kinda took me out of the experience a bit. I understand it would probably take a lot of effort to put that option in, but man would it be cool. Keep up the great work!",
        "I've been a long term fan now since 2016 when it came out and I still play it to this day! The chatrooms are very interesting to read and the visual novels are always something to look forward to! I have been in love with Saeran since the Common Route so him getting his own route was like a dream come true! Although, his route is an emotional roller coaster.."

        "I love this game one of my biggest issues though as it has a tendency to overheat your tablet or your phone. If it overheats too much then it will start shutting down the game and then can cause issues. I've had where my tablet has gotten the black screen of death and I'm having trouble using it directly in correlation to playing this game because of it overheating. This is something I think really needs to be looked into and see how they can maybe not use so much memory that it affects your tablet or your phone to the point of overheating",

I have to back out off the app and then restart for the next levels to show up. Pain in the butt. Because this has continued to happen I find myself playing less and less",
        "I have this installed on a newer tablet and have played it for a year and now I can't get it to work.  I also play this on an older tablet that I have been playing for 5 years and plays very well but when I play Elsa creations it does not calculate all that I have matched whether it be one or three.  This part needs to be fixed.  I have watched it not tally what I have matched.  No way to win when it does not work right! I am adding to this post because now frozen free fall does not work at all!  Not sure what happened.  I even uninstalled it and reinstalled it and nothing.  So everything I have played on this game is gone!!",
        "I love this game but its gotten very buggy in the last week. Screens go blank, restarts when making level selection many times over, errored out when buying snowballs, and extra challenged randomly appear and disappear so that the \"days left\" has no meaning. Someone needs to look at this.",
        "Great game that I've been playing for years now, however with the new updates, I can't play past level 1310 because the game freezes as soon as I run out of moves and it tries to reshuffle...and just this morning I can't even play a level without the game restarting over and over again! I can play all the extra bonus games with no issue, it's the regular levels that I can't play...please fix this!",

        "Its world best game ever played.  It is like a small GTA of phone or for android. It doesn't look too good but if u download and play it will like a real GTA. It is a quite big but the game is super amazing. It is not too interesting in starting but later u can play it like a GTA. It also not need any extra files to download after downloading from play store but it needs Internet connection.",
        "This game might not look so good when you download it, but there is a lot you can do. Buy properties to get money, buy guns armor, cars. There are plenty of minigames and quick play missions like street races, survival, and parachuting. The storyline may only be decent, but the missions are still fun.  The only real problem is the file size. You have to dedicate too much of your storage, if you have a newer phone with more built in storage, or a microSD card, you should try this game.",
        "Huge Kudos to the developers for making this game!! It's amazing it's literally like playing GTA but on your phone it has the story mode and it all makes sense!! The graphics are ok but I'm sure if they made this again in a Los Angeles version of some sort the graphics could get better and better!! Overall Amazing game and there's nobody else making games like this on the app store!! Great job! 10 out of 10 stars!!!",
        "Wow this game is so fun! when you go the airport, there are planes yay! and one thing you have to add to the game, please add some more hotels that are in the real Las vegas and I love the daily bonus and the one thing I hate, the military base where you get killed by a jackalope tank, bustard helicopter and the iron horse and please make the military base free to enter without getting 5 stars note: version is 3.6",
        "Best game I've ever played! In fact it is the only game I've had on my phone for 2 years. But there are some minor errors that keep occurring, such as when you are running or driving any vehicle, the control pad keeps stopping and I have to lift my thumb up and put it back down to regain control. Now I know it doesn't sound like much, it can mess up your drifts and the gas will stop as well. PLEASE FIX. Thanks",
        "It's a very great game,Nothing but love.   But I got a notification  that there is an update,I updated the game but I still can't find the new added missions in the game. Secondly I am on day 87 and my day 90 supposed  Reward changed after I downloaded the update."

        "I do like the game because it is fun.  The graphics are excellent, the gameplay is challenging; however, the new update includes an option to purchase updates to units by way of credits, alloy, and crystals.  The wording is not specific and I wasted quite a bit of crystals, credits and alloy and did not receive what I thought I purchased.  Although I am unhappy and will most likely NOT make any further purchases in this game in the future, it is still worth a try.  Just make sure you do not make the same mistake I did.  I do hope the developer reads this and makes the appropriate chsnges.  Enjoy.",
        "Loved it to begin with and spent a lot of actual money to progress...... but it only helped a little, you have to have deep pockets or too much time to get anywhere. Oh and now it's crashed, having to re install just to see if I've lost all my money!",
        "The competitive balance in this game is garbage. Unless you spend real money and play constantly, you have no chance in this game. Constantly getting attacked by players levels ahead of you no fun. I'm a lvl 8, and to have opponents only need 2 shots to destroy any of my defenses is asinine. Especially for the amount of time and ore it takes to level up. Do not waste your time on this game!",
        "I gave 2 stars.  I used to like this game but not anymore. I am lvl 7 and the only people who ever hit me are lvl 10 bases!!! What is up with that? Don't give me some bs excuse is because regardless, this is not right and I am thinking of quitting because of this.  I'm a paying customer but I won't be spending another dime on this lopsided game.  Thanks for stealing my cash and my time.",
        "Would definitely give at least 4 stars, but there's one thing that really makes me mad: The Attacking/Defending Algorithm. Out my entire squad, I have the least attacks, but I'm the leader, by far, in defenses. I don't WANT to attack anyone yet. I want to farm and get stronger. But I can't do that if I'm getting attacked 7-10 times every hour. Even when I win defenses, I still lose resources. Fix that. Make it to where people that rarely attack, are rarely attacked.",
        "this game used to be good but they have ruined the opponents. being a level 9 on all  units costs more to build to attack than the resources you can scavenge from your opponents. also the developers are allowing hundreds of absolutely identical bases to be produced so even if you decline an attack and are repaired you get matched to a different 'player' but with the same base. it's a disgrace."

        "üíñLOVE THIS GAME!  BEAUTIFUL, STUNNING GRAPHICS on each level. Continues to the next story line and game level without any ads. Only issue it keeps freezing up on me as a new player to this game. I hope I don't have to uninstall it as  its the best came I've come across that I have truely enjoyed. To many games on Google play with kiddie themes. This one is just what I've been looking for. I üíñüíñüíñüíñ it. But if it keeps freezing up I'll have no choice but to uninstall it. How sad that would be.",
        "Game is not fun at all. You spend too much time looking for stuff that it won't give you, not to mention that you need to match 5 gems to get any kind of special gem unlike other match 3 games where you get a special gem when you match 4 or more gems. If they change that I will be willing to give it another try. But until then I'm uninstalling the game and won't reinstall again.",
        "I wasn't expecting to like this game but I started it 3 hours ago and I'm still playing so it must have something good about it or I wouldn't still be here. I'm more of a play a few min and move on. It has pretty graphics, and nice story line.",
        "I love this game! The graphics are awesome and the games themselves are difficult but winnable. Just don't plan on playing through it very rapidly. The only complaint I have is that the story line is disjointed and sometimes difficult to keep track of. I would recommend this game to anyone who likes match 3 games.",
        "Great game, nice to play. But too many instructions to play makes this game BORED. Waste a lot of time. Sorry to say, I just uninstall.",
        "It is ok and worth a download. I am at level 36. The first 10 levels took two hours, then it got hard to make progress.  This is greedware requiring many $100s to play very long. The initial game plays over an hour, then becomes tedious and time-consuming. It is fine to play when on the toilet in the morning, and that seems appropriate. Mostly, this is just another match three game with excellent graphics and a modest story. Skip all the side games, those just waste resources prompting you to buy time or resources for real cash.  Never waste jewels to keep playing as there are unlimited replays only requiring you to wait for more energy to slowly but for free to build up for the next day's 15 minutes of play. The rewards for playing daily go at least for a year, so it takes a long time to finish."

        "Addictive and  overall  good game but could be improved. Anyone that's played for a number of years will agree that changes in the last year are ruining the game. The events pretty much every month now are ridiculous.  The instant builds & gold abuse are out of hand. Used to be a game of skill, a level playing field in regards to age, background & financial means, where players skill level & strategy were tested on the battlefield, now it's become a pay to win game where teams are assembled based on how much they will spend to win. For all the $$ Inno is making off gold purchases, they fail to invest back into the game experience for a smooth running game. Example, the game will freeze up on a player being op'd and they are not able to effectively defend. This issue has been brought up many times to Inno & has yet to be corrected. Players know the glitch & many exploit it, again making for an unfair playing field. Many long time & loyal players are choosing to leave the game after finishing up current, active world's due to changes in the last year or so. For new players, it's a fun & addictive game in which you have the opportunity to meet & play with people from all over the world, but be advised the description is misleading, it's not a free game & based on skill as it once was. If you want to win, be prepared that you will need to spend a great deal in the newer version pay to win it's become.",

When swiping it doesn't always read the swipe and kick it for a try through ball. When shooting the swipe isn't constant, I can swipe as fast as i can and it goes 54mph. Either give us an analog to move the player so the screen is just used for swiping or better your current way so it doesn't glitch or give issue.

Keeps you interested and doesn't require a great expenditure of cash if you are a relatively casual player.  Plenty of good themed events.  All in all a good distraction which I have now been playing for almost a year !",
        "I have been enjoying this game very much since I installed it maybe about a month ago. I actually stopped participating in a game that I've been in for 3 years for I find the is more entertaining, better graphics, quick response time on tickets and the community is more open. Highly recommend this game; which I might add is for all ages and gender who enjoy space battles and strategy. Thanks eh",
        "Love this game. it would be nice to know what kind of equipment you are going up against in war like you see when you are in pursuit mode i.e. DT, CR, MS, BS and what kind of weapons and defense. Thanks for the great game",
        "Great game with a large degree of strategy. Unfortunately, recent changes make it very difficult to obtain good heroes without P2P. This is most likely going to erode the free to play player base resulting in a game that is not as fun to play. Hopefully this can be rectified in future updates.",

Oh an let's not forget the equally pointless (get your hands in your pockets/debit/credit card rip-off) St Patricks day event. Cue no crystal/AP boosters.. Seriously you jokers should all have stripey shirts on with a little printed card with numbers on attached.. What's truly sad is the games good, possibly even great.. But! Greed as always outweighs the gamers creed.. FYI! I don't expect a reply.. Your preprogrammed bots don't know how to deal with genuine critism, nor do you care either",

However, for game play 4 stars, because it is really annoying that every ship coming into a port, or finishing repairs, you have to click on visit the port! Why can't there be a OK option there as well? But, overall excellent game!",

Great for a bit but really lags on... speed it up please",

        "Great game. Fantastic for when you have some spare time. But for the the normal cargo (Not Contract) the loads need to be bigger than 28k tonne. Especially when you use the bigger bulk and container ships! Please make this happen",

Because of slow loading it will kill your battery life fast as well. Please help to fix the problem and I will re-rate again. Thanks",

I have the silver subscription ($1.00/weekly) and im unable to take advantage of the content im paying for  want a refund. The upgrades and new equipment are too expensive, the gear and parts are also too expensive and hard to come by especially for the spearfishing which is the best part of the game.. You certainly can't get very far without spending some real money. You can be killed by animals when the come from behind so you with your limited turning capability you have no chance to defend yourself. A lot of problems.",

        "This game is awesome. The girls are beautiful and the songs are nice. There are a couple of errors I be having with the game though. I would have liked if they had subtitles to the songs so we know what they are singing. Also give us a chance to earn more gems and scouting tickets.The scouting I think is also not fair. I would scout single ten times and not get anything but a rare. While my friends do single scouts and get ur and SSR. YOU won't get goods cards unless you pay or do the 11 scout. The pricings also could be improved",
        "I like music game in general, it's hard to get the game right on mobile. but they manage to get it right here. The LP system prevent you to play continuesly unless you paid. But in my experience the amount is decent enough (this make you enjoy the music more since you dont have to restart to achieve perfection). The card mechanic is added bonus where you can spend hard earn cash. I can see people still enjoying the game without spending anything.",
        "Warning! This game is freakin' addictive. Good graphic with cute characters. Recommended for anyone who loves idol genre ... Suggestion: please fix the lagging. The circle disappear sometimes during the live show. Sometimes the app even doesn't recognize my finger touch that makes me miss a circle. But overall. It's a good game  .... ALL HAIL PRINTEMPS AND GUILTY KISS",
        "I love the game definitely but with the new update, it keeps telling me that there's a transmission error then when it went through and finished connecting, it said that the data transfer was successful. I haven't transfered anything to a new device or anything like that. The only options I'm given is to contact support and start a new game in which I definitely don't want to do. It isn't my connection because everything else on my phone that requires WiFi is fine and I can use it. Is this because of the new update?",
        "I love the game and it's wonderful!!  But...  I had i don't know like a glitch or something.  When started to play the rhythm game while I playing suddenly the icon that I should press came faster all or a sudden. But the song is still OK.  After the glitch it becames back to normal.  This happen me for 3 times on the same day. Please fix it. And Thank you.",
        "It's so addicting and a fabulous rhythm game. One thing I'm really picky on is that you press the circle on the beat and this is the only game so far that has stayed true to all the notes being on the EXACT beat. Other games don't do that and it bothers me to no end bc I don't know when to press but this game is great and I love it dearly. Also cute girls."

And I have a pic saved of my pocket pair.   Last time I checked it is impossible to be dealt two of the same card.   And in what world does a three of a kind lose to two pair.   Will never spend money on this app again!!!!!!!    So glad to receive a generic response...   It would have been nice if you actually read the review.  It doesn't matter how lucky you are. You cannot get get 2 of the exact same card dealt in the same hand.  And no matter how lucky you are 3 of a kind shouldn't be losing to two pair.  That just the rules of poker.",

        "This is an updated version. My last post was from I think September or maybe October, but this game is truly AMAZING!!! The story line itself is great as well as the side story's that you can read as well. This game has changed so much from when I started playing this game in August. The events are great but I think the developers can give a little bit better rewards then just XP juice and more jewels as well as heart stamina, but other than that the game is perfect no glitches and non of that stuff. The one year anniversary was amazing thank you for that!! I can't wait for season 10 and the future seasons of Moe Ninja Girls!!!",
        "There really isn't anything negative to say about \"Moe! Ninja Girls\" the story is great, every character is deep and likeable, even if you're a free player each chapter is long enough to keep you coming back and paying is definitely worth it,too. It looks great and sounds great to boot. I honestly don't like mobile games at all but this is amazing and would be even it were a console or pc game. To me this is THE perfect app on mobile so download it now! And devs: I hope you continue to support the game because if you guys keep making seasons,I'll keep playing. Love you guys! &lt;3",
        "The story is really the best part of the whole game. The ninja fighting seems to be arbitrary , as you can have high stats and still lose a match. Collecting new gear is fun but you don't get as much new gear as you would like. Sometimes the game stretches the abilities of my Amazon fire eight and crashes under Google Play add in. This story definitely makes it worthwhile playing though it's funny and titillating!  ;-)",
        "Amazing story! Great characters. Other similar apps dont compare. Im playing completely free so far, just finished Season 1, and many awesome event stories. Well worth my time. Yes you have to wait 4 hours between chapters, but who cares. Its actually a nice pace.",
        "Cute anime girls. Only things is that the gameplay was really simple. I've played some dating games before and usually there's more options or they appear more frequently. And the ninja fight mini game was also simple. I don't know. This game seems to get good reviews so maybe it's just me.",
        "The game's quite sensational! You wouldn't believe how hooked I am to this game when I finally found it then played it. The story is quite good, the cast are very unique. All in all, a great game. Oh, it would be nice to add some mini-games that allow players to gain nineys/gems other than the ninja fights. Also, there were some hick-ups with some of the dialogues where the words don't make sense but it's still readable."

The one above the have supplied to Google bounced back.  The one they advertise in game gets ignored. Take your money oh yes they sure WILL given the daily but this offers. NO SUPPORT REPORTING TO GOOGLE as support email is fake.",
        "This game is wildly disproportionate.... There are players who spend thousands of dollars on in-app purchases and have insane amounts of power so they pick on the players who can't afford to do the same. The amount of resources required to upgrade technology and buildings becomes astronomical very quickly and mining for the resources needed is impossible due to the fact that the huge players hunt mines. Adding to this, every time your fleet gets hit on a mine or a base you lose 20% of that fleet, which costs you more resources to build it back up, compounding the impossibility to grow unless you spend insane amounts of money. If you don't have ridiculous amounts of money to waste on this game, don't bother downloading it.",
        "The game is useless loaded with players with multiple accounts . And nothing but RACIST and FOUL LANGUAGE  players are berating players with bullying tactics not a game to play . Looking to maybe take the owner to court for not doing anything about stopping this illegal activity of sexual harassment ect.",
        "The game developer keeps changing things so they can make more proffit it's not for the benefit of the players it's for the benefit for they can make more profit do not spend the money to start this game you're good so far along and then he'll change it on you or cost you more just to stay status quo",
        "Lee, the developer, offers items via in-game advertising and frequently fails to deliver ALL of the content you were promised. Then when you complain, he purposely delays any response for 48 hours because that takes you outside of the Google Play store Return Policy...thus forcing you to either continue to not be responded to OR contest the entire transaction as fraud through your bank.  It's a shyte app with a greedy AF developer. DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS APP!!",

        "Over engineered upgrades which are clearly done as a gold mine for DroidHen. Result is you either pay to win or massive grind. Defender II was more balenced in this regard but still a huge grind too. I think World Raid is a myth since it has never worked. It apperently lasts about 30 second but I don't know since it mostly throws an error. I've gotten in twice and it immediately goes to Stage Cleared with &gt;97% beast life left.",
        "Bug that you have to wait endlessly to enter daily raid seems to be partially fixed. But: 1. Raid is even more fraudulent than before...no mattet you defense, dragon will one hit you. Fraud, there is no reason for a mechanic you cannot do anything about except exploitation! 2. I have all the upgrades and do pretty much max dmg, but there seem to be people out there that do 20 times the amount I do...except they don't, because they simply DO NOT EXIST!!! AS IN BATTLE MODE THEY ARE SIMPLY MADE UP BY THE DEVS! THEY ARE NOT ACTUALLY REAL PLAYERS!!! 3. The skill that decreases % of all dmg does not do so...it virtually does not reduce damage at all, but still it costs 50 crystals per % point. Also fraud! 4. You pay for somethin but you cannot keep it. If you change your phone, everything is lost forever! This is criminal behaviour! CONCLUSION: Probably the most fraudulent and criminal organisation out there. BEWARE AND DO NOT INSTALL, AND FOR CHRISTS SAKE, DON'T SPEND MONEY ON IT!!!",

        "Nice game, im still playing but it should be an easier way (for ppl that dont want to spend real life money on these games) to get diamonds. Cost for outfits/shoes/jewlery are extremely high 189 diamonds for a dress i mean come on. Only can watch one video to earn 1 diamond thats disappointing. I'll give 5 stars if getting diamonds gets easier or mini games to get diamonds would be great.",
        "I Love this game but recently it has disappointed me. To move on to the next task I have to buy an expensive house which I can't afford (Hollywood mansion). I can't even buy the coins to afford it because the coins are so expensive too. There is no way of getting around it, I have tried making movies and moving up levels but I am always stuck with the same problem. I can't even skip the task! I am on the verge of rage quitting this game.",
        "This is the best game I have ever played. This must be the world's NO. 1 game. Please make lessen the amount of money that you have for the London Mansion. Please add more stories as I have finished all the stories (except the London Mansion). The last thing is that this game should have more updates as in my IPad there is a new version of this game. Thank you.",
        "I really do love it, but 95% of the clothing requires a ton of diamonds that are very rare and difficult to earn but when you do receive them you only get a couple. Also, it's very frustrating that searching for random objects consumes your energy. Please, PLEASE fix those.",
        "I would give it 5 steers but every time I try to go into a Beverly hills store my game crashes and I have to close the game and I try again and it keeps happening also the losing is slow. If you fix this I will give it 5. Thanks.",
        "This game is toooo Goooooood. But the dresses are very costly, no new hair styles, in spin wheel i never got 500 or 1000 diamonds, also i want to have this character a baby. Please reduce the prize of the dressed. Also London is nothing in front of a Hollywood mansion"

        "This game has had me hooked for almost two years now. There is always something to work on and improve. For long time Final Fantasy fans, this is the ultimate fanservice. I found this game to be more nostalgic than even other Final Fantasy crossover games like Dissidia and Theatrhythm. My only gripe is that I wish there was some sort of non-battle exploration aspect. A chance to explore the 3d FF games in 2d, even if they were brief and not the whole worlds, would be a nice touch. Highly recommended if you're looking for an addictive combat-focused rpg to devote yourself to, and super recommended for Final Fantasy fans.",
        "Some minor technical issues with hanging or loading forever screens... but overall superb job with the idea, and best part is not needing to gatcha for your fave ff characters. Prob the least p2win of the top mobile games out there",
        "I would rate it a 5, but the problem is that after the 6/8 update, the game ended up being super slow.  Extremely slow that I had to set my battle speed to 1 just to perform a blatant laggy action.  If you fix this issue, then I'll be happy to re-rate it a 5, but for now, you deserve a 3 unless you resolve it.",
        "A fun game that makes you think about playing other Final Fantasy games. I have become invested in various characters and I am interested in Ffiv. The sprites do not work for all characters as it is hard to see differences between characters such as Vayne and Larsa. The game has missed an opportunity to create a storyline to bring the various games together. However it is a fun game that makes you want to play the full range of the Final Fantasy franchise.",
        "I can't remain as positive as I used to be towards the game. With the various app issues such as excessively long loading times, poor performance, and issues with in-app purchases, I have soured on the game as a whole. The lack of daily missions that the japan side of the game received with the FF3 Onion Knight event that we still haven't received reeks of greed and deprives us of about 100 mythril (the in game currency) compared to where we should be.   The game itself, when it runs properly is still excellent. And it is awesome to use your favorite Final Fantasy characters, or become new fans of some. But DeNA has treated the Global version of the game as an afterthought as of late.",
        "I gave this game 5 stars on EVERYTHING! But... I have some criticism. Some of the dungeons are completely too difficult. I've been playing the game for 2 years now DIEHARD and i still can't get even close to beating some of the bosses."

        "Updated This game has become about how much time and MONEY you can spend on it. They don't care about issues in game or what feed back they get. There are hundreds of issues that don't get addressed they just add more and more content hope people ignore the issues. Thed new content creates new issues and in some cases makes old issues worse",
        "Don't bother. Pay players only do well. And it's expensive! Devs have it programmed for pay players so you fall far behind and can't catch up. They match you against pay players that are always stronger. Contests are extremely difficult. Been playing for 2 years so I know what I'm commenting about.",
        "Ever since the new owners took over, content has lessened. Although new heroes appear, it is all about money scams and contests. Turned down drop rates make it nearly impossible to upgrade with dropping piles of cash.",
        "Used to be a fun game with silly characters and lots to do. Since sold by per blue game quality has plummeted. Deleted and moved on to other games that run smoother and appreciate customer feedback.",
        "The text in game as become tiny almost unreadable since last update. Am I the only one? I'm playing on galaxy S8.",
        "One of my accounts was stolen, I had it connected to FB, Google & Email, I have gotten an email asking for things they need to verify, I sent what I could, name, server, etc, I also sent pics of the name it was when I had it and the name they changed it to, also the guild name, still not heard a thing back? It can't be that hard to get it back, I known a few ppl working in the gaming area, and they say it's pretty easy that you guys probably could care less, as long as you get your money...I really like playing it, I've put money into it, but security is horrible if I can have it connected to 3 things, yet someone can still steal it???.....Very disappointed now."

        "5 min for 1 bar of energy is too long to wait. Loose interest.. when you level up the energy bar stays the same. It doesn't refill or increase.  Which also annoying as takes too long to complete timed tasks.  Frustrating as hell as decent game but as states above is a disappointment. Improve on these factors and you have a decent game until then there's no point in playing as everything is LONG and boring",
        "I love that this game features the cast of Desperate Housewives - they look so similar and it makes me remember what their voices on the show are like. I think it's great that the game can be played Offline and how there is a storyline with mystery involved. I've played most of the game and just play the new episodes as they come. 4 Stars!",
        "I don't understand why you don't get a refill of energy when you level up. It takes so long as it is to full up.... give us a freebie when we hit a milestone!",
        "Its ok...a bit. The concept is interesting. But the game is getting too monotonous. .. and also do something about the energy refill.  It takes too long. Overally its an ok game but there is room for improvement.",
        "Y'all need to hurry up !! I already completed Chapter 14. Like what are y'all waiting on ?! Don't make a game so damn addicting and have people waiting to see what's next. Get a move on. Until then you only get 3 stars.",
        "Only issue is you have to wait so long for energy..  Only get to play for a few minutes..  Then wait on energy!  Would be willing to pay for it for a better deal :) but still gets a 5 star!!"

Would be obvious but most have 10 alternate accounts making it harder to see how dead it has become. The select army function has been broke for months even tho they have updated to make map look like snow and buildings animate faster. Pointless... Lag is even worse and now impossible to do anything when attacked you have to exit game and reload to hopefully have anything left. Theres been multiple hacks making armys instant return to there death. Nothing waz done to fix it. Very expensive packages are rigged to only give one commander but imply that you recieve the 32 needed to complete one. Experimentals fail even at 110% chance success. The players are great community and support slightly improved. It is a very complex game with many things to keep u busy forever. To many issues to list all most of all need to MERGE SERVERS MERGE SERVERS MERGE SERVERS MERGE SERVERS",

        "I was having so much fun with this app today after the updated it on my S3 Galaxy tablet! Seriously!! This is dope! I can't wait to level up my grade from 3 & move forward to grade 5! When I watched the ATIS video tutorial,  I was blown away! It seems that \"Expert Server\" is becoming much more awesome with their new feature added in the server!! I really can't wait to get there! This is awesome update FDS!  Great job!  Keep it up! üòäüòéüëçüëçüëåüëåüôåüôå",
        "This is truly a step up over your average plane simulation games. With Global release and many changes that have taken place it truly is the best out there.  My only gripe is that there is not enough focus on African Airlines. The new update has totally been focused on American and European Airlines. Most African airlines already have aircraft listed in Infinite Flight but yet aren't added. Sad really, hence the 4 stars",
        "Its good to hear that ur asking for our feedback. First of all let me tell that u guys are doing a superb job...keep it up and lots of love to u all who developed this simulator. One request to the admins that atleast reply to what we are asking, not exactly at the same time but take ur time and reply.. previously i had asked about adding liveries to 777 300 er model no one replied or even acknowledged that ur reply has been received. I hope to get a reply here atleast.  I would like to know when u will add A350 and more liveries in 777-300er model ( would love to see air india, jet airways, china southern, china eastern, jal, ana, korean air, alitalia).. please add this liveries.. it will be awesome",

        "Played this game since the beginning, one of the biggest updates has only been made to those who have to pay an extortionate amount.  Feel robbed really and the fact I can't play the game offline, seriously? ffs what a waste.",
        "Well this is a bit atrocious. I feel entirely missold, was shown this app with the ability to fly pretty much from and to anywhere on the planet. I even had it on a previous phone and did such. Now I buy it and oh guess what? It was updated so one can't fly from one city to another, let alone another country. I mean it's pretty pointless at this point, don't think I can justify the additional ¬£75 (per year) to enable me to actually use this and salvage some fun out of it -_-   Tl;Dr? I almost want my ¬£5 back bc it was used for about 5 minutes - may as well build paper planes as they go further."

        "Players leaving this game since updates have put up resource costs. Slowly but surely turning into a p2w game. Game is also glitchy and support do nothing to help.  It could be a great game,  don't kill it before it leaves beta.",
        "Seemed great then I realised that the 'beta' has been non progressive forever, the updates only include small pirate gathering and fleet adjustment,  never the main things like resource sharing and reinforcement which are the big things people actually want aswell as convenient random fleet losses that either you get no reports for or none of your ships are saved by the warp which is purely for that purpose.  Play by all means but don't expect to advance unless your pockets are deep.",

        "I absolutely LOVE this game!! The stories of each character are amazing! I just wish they had more suitors. And I wish they made more games exactly like this but with a completely new story line and characters. Like, I love the voice animations and how long the chapters are and how long the story line of each person is. I also love how your character talks like a modern day girl when she's at the sengoku era. You don't have to pay to see more about each person either. It's amazing. I Love this app. Please make more!!!! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è",
        "So, this is my third update. That's how much I love this game üòÇ. Thank you for giving us castle and closet space via game events. Very helpful. I don't have anymore lag issues. And I appreciate the diversity in storylines. No route is the same, unlike other Otome games. Also, the relationship development is fantastic - not too slow or fast. The main character actually talks like a real person and less like a \"character\". Art is beautiful, too. I just feel bad that I can't say much about the music or voice acting, as I usually have my phone on vibrate.",
        "Idk what to say, but one thing for sure I really loveee this game!!!! Is so awesome, the chara omg so magnificent. I don't mind spending much money on this game hahaha it's so freaking beautiful!!! And I really love the MC she's so strong and cute, it's just like I want to have a route for MC too. But rn I'm waiting for KENSHIN UESUGI route, I hope it will come out soon. Damn, Cybird always make such a beautiful otome game. Thank you for making this game, it just made my lifeüíóüíóüíóüíó",
        "I couldn't resist to do a newer version of the review, so here it is. I've been playing this game for nearly three months now, and that's saying something. First of all, the story is really engaging. The characters are really sweet, and I love how we don't need to spend money to enjoy it, unlike other otome games. Shout-out to the people who made Ieyasu's route a dream come true.",
        "There are only a few routes out currently but they are wonderful all the same. The main character is funny and reacts realistically to situations! Not to mention the voice acting is impeccable like wow I don't speak a word of Japanese but everytime Nobunaga speaks I'm just nodding along. Also this game has an adorable animated series and it is the best",
        "The most romantic and sweetest experience of falling in love game..  I feel like I'm truly falling in love with Masamune date.. Love his playful side, his sweetness,  fierce yet gentle  sometimes.. The only reason I CANNOT RATE 5 STAR is I cant read back the route chosen even though I have spent actual money..  Its like I'm purchasing the story,  but the fact is,  I'm not.. This is frustrating..  Atleast after having spending so much money,  we can keep the story to be read again afterwards..  Please reconsider this..  Thank you"

Performance is the worst is all i can say. Not strictly pay to win but almost still fun while free and has been for years. I just hope it works decently on your device as performance has just gotten worse over the years on my dozens of devices. They stopped caring about the game and set their sights on money instead kinda sad",
        "Hello, Gamers and Gaea this game used to be fun, up til a certain point ive emailed gaea for past 2 months and Stephen the developer overwritten my account with another player account, and refused to rectify the situation or refund me fully. He/she denied me, refused to take liability, even though I can prove it all. At first I didn't want my money back, I wanted my account back. It hurts me to say you refused to help a spending player. You guys basically stole my accounts and my money.",

        "AWESOME!!! LOVE THE FACT IT'S ANIME! Also, if you haven't already done a spirited away or soul eater collaboration, I suggest you do it. Oh, and are people supposed to curse here? Because they curse a lot. Oh, and a Bleach collaboration would be nice if you haven't done that one either. THESE HATERS DO NOT UNDERSTAND THE AMAZING BEAUTY IN THIS GAME!!!",
        "Since recently you have been doing Anime collabs, I was wondering if one of the next ones could be Voltron? I admire the work you put into the characters in the games style but also looking like the characters. ^.^",
        "Really Ateam? So I have two monsters that require the awakening ninoyu to awaken. The small pack for me is 27,99$ and the big one 42,99$. Keep in mind I've never bought one before. Yet my friend only needs 24,99$ for the small one and 37,99$ for the big pack. Really?? Why??",
        "the art style is nice and cute, it is a really fun game to play specially if your a hardcore gamer, and you can fully costumize your characters appearance which is one reason i really like this game, i recommend this game if you like grinding your character and other stuff, and for the story it is also good.",
        "Started playing for the Fairy Tail event.  Already have Lucy and Zeref from just my first day playing, and level 40 character after just a few hours.  Warning, highly addicting.",
        "Took me 45-50 mins to even make the character but just before I could play ,the game froze . It looked good but not that good if it freezes over and over again"

I wish therr was a way to go back and do the tutorial again and I accidently pressed during the first one and missed how to land. Lots of trial and error on that one. Also would be nice to know how the scoring exactly works.",
        "It's getting frustrating.. I'm into level 14, have up graded skills and equipment but yet still can't manage to get a bronz let alone a silver or gold in the very first jump in the game. Along with finishing a constant 16th about 95% of the time make me think it's rigged. What's up with that??",
        "Fantastic concept and artwork and potentially amazing game ruined by a half arsed tutorial and lack of information, pure laziness.  The fun of the game turns to frustration as you get good distance and terrible scores, but why? You assume landings but the game gives you no information on correct technique. Also same for takeoff and mid air lift.   Come on devs its lazy and ruining a game with huge potential. Uninstalled...",
        "By level 4 no matter what score i get the bots always get about 15 higher. 1 game i would get 130 and the bots would get 145. Then when i get 160 they still get 175 showing this is rigged. That makes it so annoying with a lack of help from the developers make it annoying otherwise would b 5 stars if these issues were fixed",
        "The game has a great Idea to it, but it really needs so tweaking in the physics deparment of the game, on certain Stages I go further with a Bad Jump then a Excellent one, and the wind doesnt really play that much of an effect in the game. But overall great and fun game, amd very addictive.",
        "This game is actually very good, I play a lot of mobile games as its normally all I have time for and this is challenging and fun, the career mode is good and also like the upgrades..  I will definitely be keeping this one on my phone for a while because it is a really cool game. If you don't like ads then click you back button to get rid of it from time wasting or spend the buck to lose them forever.. Well done on a cool game, make some more like it!!"

        "It's okay. The graphics are endearing. Controls and gameplay are smooth and easy to understand. A freemium game to be sure. It openly offers over-priced items like they are a great deal (they aren't). Most of it's purchase items are more expensive than other games. It has a gem subscription but for only 10 days, most simular games offer it for the full month for the same price, while offering more gems.",
        "OMG THIS IS AWESOME PEOPLE DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY ARE MISSING THE GRAPHICS AND CONTROLS AND EVERYTHING ABOUT IT IS GREAT!!!!!! Except for the part when you raid somebody and the opponent's team always kills you before you kill them. ANYWAYS IT'S STILL THE BEST keep the updates coming IT IS SO FUN DESPITE NOBODY I KNOW EXCEPT FOR MY FAMILY EVEN KNOWS IT EXISTS GREATEST GAME EVEEEERRRRRR!!!",
        "Multitude of heroes to make your team. Not stingy about giving the player stuff. Potential fun for all, as casual game. Has PvP elements. Energy bar system replenishes when level up and even progresses in size as you advance. Should not be an issue until you get farther in, random energy gains also occur on maps with a little luck. Short tutorial at game beginning is torture to endure but is over in under 5 min. Great free game!",
        "Love the game so far. You could say I'm a try hard because I've only been playing the game for a month and a week and I'm already level 52. With 100% win rate and 83% defense rate  have one of the best teams in the game. And like I said before love it so far but for the next update. You'll should add friendly battles. Such as battling with your friends, clan mates, random players. Etc.",
        "Pretty fun game but I had an issue happy pretty quickly into the game and I'm hoping devs see this and help out.  I bought ten common portals for the 100k gold, after opening the first one the game decided to crash and I am no longer able to redeem my 9 other chest. I change to 5 star if we can this resolved. Thanks",
        "Hi, I don't know if it is a hack or what BUT even if my defenders WON then still it minus my POINTS and it shows that I LOST? Whereas the replay is different. And morover Aria's sand in eyes should also provoke the target. And legendary heroes are sometimes not getting worth. They need Interesting passives. Thx. Plz reply üòò"

When are the problems going to be fixed. This is worse then my beta tester games. Very unhappy also don't expect Ubisoft to help u",
        "I'm playing this game for almost two years, and never get bored. I uninstalled a lot of game's on this time except Horse Haven: World Adventures. At this moment I think we need a Grand Stable for fantasy land, and another land for exclusive horse's, they are so much now on the game. Thank you Ubisoft for this awesome game. ‚ù§Ô∏è",
        "I would definitely recommend this game to horse lovers. However, it doesn't satisfy me and the quite some Dutch players since it has our neighbouring countries Germany and France but not our own. It feels as if our country is just being neglected. It would be great if someone could do something about this issue.",

        "It's a great game, I love that I get to interact with the horses and the graphics is good then only down fall is I can't earn money that much and you run out of it quick, and you can't make enough for crops or upgrading, since you have to upgrade alot to get food for the horses."

        "It's a fun game but pvp is a big part and can take a week building up an army just to have it crushed when you log on. Has caused me to not play for a day or two because of this but also what makes me come back it offers that challenge that is often lost in most games like this where is the fun of there is no risk. Not to many tedious tasks after about day 5 no longer logging in every 3 hours to start a build project or something.",
        "Other people might think its a boring game, but this game really fits for someone who doesnt want to get stressed out in a game.. really love the concept. Been a player here for almost 6 years now.. tried other games but still going back to this game.",
        "Should add a few features like: 1. Able to share your battle report with other players. 2. Cancel troops in training. 3.See incoming attack on Hamlets you're holding (Or add a lost art which helps to see it).",
        "My most resource hungry app on the tablet. Need to buy too many stuff to be a top level player. Lately, more stuff to buy and twice as expensive. Don't recommend this game.",
        "Complex empire builder, takes time to learn. Definitely a pay to win. Lots of people with alts and coin hacks. Still lots to do. It's fun, but not worthy of serious commitment.",

        "Would of given 5 stars if it wasnt for the 300 energies as it doesnt go very far, would be better if it refilled twice a day instead of once. Why do you have to spend money on special scenes they should be unlocked if you picked the right choices not pay for them. Apart from that love the story and the graphics are great if these issues could be sorted that would be great",
        "I downloaded this due to the narrative and the reviews, but I am not a fan of this game. 300 energies (30 sentences) is very short I get through it in about 3 minutes and then you wait an entire 24hours for another. I love the storyline and the graphics so therefore this would be good for someone who is a slower reader. It's a shame but I will be uninstalling.",
        "Wish there was more energy or like an easier way to get more energy. I get 450 energy for the day with the initial 300 and playing the mini game which gives 100 and watching the adds which is 50. But it's not enough I feel like I only get about a couple sentences in and then I run out. Maybe if you could play the mini game every hour or two to get the 100 energy and watch the ads around the same time to get 150 instead of waiting 24 hrs it would be better. The story progresses too slowly with that little amount.",
        "The game has me hooked. I'm big on reading so I fly through the 300 energies. I've spent $10 repeatedly, even $20 for energy and it feels like it was gone in the same amount of time as the 300 energies. If you allowed maybe 4 refills a day, it would be amazing, or some other way, maybe to just keep playing the minigame. There has to be something more other than 20 energies for a video once a day. But despite the lack of energy, this game has me so disgustingly hooked. I love it so much.",
        "I think this game is really good. I just have one problem. Even though it says my energy is full, it feels like I have nothing. And also the mini game 100 energy seems to last longer than the initial 300 you receive. If you could fix this taht would be great. And if it's designed like this can you make energy spending more efficient?",
        "This game really addictive!! The only problem is they don't give you enough energy.üòíyou either have to buy energy or play a mini game to get more energy. The highest energy points that you can get is 100. Plus the 30 points if you watch a video. Other than that the game is AMAZING. The graphics are realistic. It has a lot of romance too. You should definitely download this game if you're not bothered about the energy points."

I had been playing this game for almost 4-5 years already.  With my issues being resolved I would say I love this game so much.  Much recommended.  üòò",
        "I have waited 30min to see the gameplay after started the game. Very confusing.Bla bla, shiny things all arround, see this, take those, listen to the story and chose your 120lvl character. What is the point for new players to start from 120 lvl? How this can be fun?But never mind, I never understood the games which do that. Sorry, but I didnt find this game interesting for me.",
        "Wow, what do I think? I think this game is all hype took 4hrs plus change to download the game after installing it so to even play it was a joke, then when I finally was able, it froze on the log in screen and took me back out to my home page on my phone screen, only to then tell me the game had not been installed!!! Yeah clearly it is as it's taken up space! Not very good I'm not happy, I will try again before uninstalling this game if I manage to get in the game, obviously the review will change get but until then it's 1 star ass I can not go any lower. Sorry game makers!",
        "I wonder if there will be transcended busters in the future. Or perhaps the current arch buster will be the 'warrior' type and there will 1 of each type for us to mount. Looking forward to the overlord release though!",
        "Love the game been playing for over 2 1/2 years. Only one probably lately and that is my WB scores have been down substantially along with other users. I dont understand how going from a few archs' to having 6 and new gear makes my score down 14 trillion? Im bot the only one this is happening to so im a bit confused on what the problem is. Other than that great game play it everyday. Just dont like losing rewards on my wb% when it should be higher.",
        "After massive update and huge changes, I have to change my rating from 2 to 5.Such a big improvement toward all player,either f2p or whales.Congrats Gamevil, hopefully the community will grow as we see now in this game itself."

        "This game is quite good. The graphics are pretty nice for a kid's game, and I do appreciate how there are vents to win power up. That is a very nice update. It seems like Disney took the kids element a little more into consideration.  The later stages do get understandable harder. But after the 100th stage is almost impossible for kid's standerard, but I don't mind it since other games do the same thing.",
        "The game WAS great..spin the wheel, watch an ad, get a gameplay reward.  Great. But OMG now there's an BETWEEN squares AND for  rewards??!!! After you refused to give me back lost features  & said \"Disney had NO INTENTION of doing that in the future\", I had to think whether to uninstall the game, or suck it up & gimp along. Think you guys made the decision for. Too bad, I really enjoyed the game. Thx for what USED TO BE fun.",
        "This may not mean much to most. After suffering from a head injury, my memory was terrible. Level 250, memory coming back strong. I play daily on 2 devices. Just wish you could win gems, you have  to buy them except 22 in beginning. All in all 3-4 stars.",
        "I love love love this game!  BUT....THE ONLY THING I HATE IS THAT YOU CANNOT SAVE YOUR PROGRESS...IVE HAD TO REINSTALL THIS GAME 3x's AND LOST ALL PROGRESS! Maybe if i wasn't on level 280 it wouldn't be an issue! You should have this as a feature by now! UGH! üò†üò≠",
        "Impossible to save or synchronize progress! As mentioned in many other reviews, it is not possible to save game progress, even if you link to your Facebook account. App support website confirms this functionality is simply not supported. Absolutely unbelievable. Just unbelievable. Don't waste your time on this game - it really will be _wasted_ time.",
        "This is a great game and you can have fun for hours. I'd rate it 5 stars if a few things were changed. First, you need to be able to sync on other devices, especially if connecting to Facebook. I have other games that sync, no reason why this game can't get with that technology. Just got a new phone, was at level 346, and now have to start over on new phone. Luckily old phone will still be used. Second, it's impossible to earn gems. There should be special events to earn gems. Yes, you can spin to win, but the odds aren't in your favor to earn them. Third, there should be more opportunities to earn helps. The event to pass 5 levels is extremely difficult and there aren't many other opportunities to earn helps. I'm not spending money on this game. Take tips from Farm Heroes! Overall, this is a fun game and the graphics are cute."

Particularly like going back to this title every now and again for a no-pressure, casual simulation game. Surprisingly, Game Dev Tycoon is pretty smooth on mobile, so kudos to the devs!",
        "Just gave this game 5 star everything. When this game first came out on PC I couldn't afford it, so I pirated it. Sorry Greenheart! Now I have the chance to purchase your game and I'm glad I have. I know I'm going to play this for hours on end. It is definitely the best indie game I've ever played. Looking forward to your next project Greenheart!!",
        "Loving the game! Not sure where else to try to contact the devs, but I am having an issue. My auto save is from Year 15. I am currently in year 22, and so is my manual save. However, whenever I try to load my manual save, it only takes me back to the year 15 autosave. I know it's just a game but it's pretty upsetting to not be able to access that lost progress, so any tips or response would be awesome. Great game!",
        "It's good. 80 hours on PC version. This has some extra bits. Just want to support Dev, but am looking forward to playing it more on phone. Haven't had a bug yet either. Controls are great, they really lended themselves to mobile!",
        "Played for days on the PC version. This one is just like it, except in the palm of your hands. No micro transactions, coins, or loot boxes. One price for the full game. Amazing!  In Game Dev Tycoon, you make games and build a company to from your parents garage, to a fully fledged AAA Studio. The controls are awesome. Your first games will be tests to how and what gamers like. You'll develop games for real life hardware (with names changed for licensing issues). Eventually, when you get to late game, you can create your own console and compete with other companies, releasing exclusive titles of your own, and dominating the market share.   You'll easily lose if you're not careful with your finances, but the game is so addicting that you'll keep coming back to it. Like I did.",
        "I don't ever rate games, but this one deserves it. Only been playing an hour and I love it. I'm already excited to start over and try things differently. Totally worth the money and I highly suggest this for any sim fans. Great time killer as well. Good job guys."

        "This game should be avoided. They don't care about what the players think and refuse to make improvements or adjustment players suggest. Progress is slow and even if you spend real money your odds of getting what you want is low.  Avoid starting at a costs. It is not worth your time.",
        "It is impossible to have a good team without spending lots of money.  In order to have a good team you need 4 star level robots which even when you do get a chance to get one, you will end up with a duplicate which will be liquidated for just about nothing. Hence better players get better and lower level players stay at the bottom. Also players that spend alot tend to get better chances on draws that are supposed to be random. Wow that's a surprise",
        "This game is a lot of fun. Great time killer. The only thing I think could be improve is the fact that you can't upgrade your bots with duplicates you get in the space bridge. And possibly better mechanics to see the bots you have walking around your base. Other than that. It's amazing.",
        "Slow, VERY SLOW You have to wait for everything.  After each battle, the Autobots need 7 minutes to recover for the next battle, but I have enough fuel for battle.  And, as your robots get more stars, the more you have to wait.  So it is about 20 minutes per game for me. Slow  Then if you accidentally switch to another apps or shut the screen off for a second, you will have to wait for the game to reload for another 2 or 3 minutes.  slow  Graphics is beautiful, but story suck, and wait time is horrible",
        "Updated. Games are supposed to be fun, if u play this game be prepared for a complete lack of respect for its user Base from the devs and a lack of fun events. Even those spending 1000s are bored  Don't start spending as the game is dying Don't expect good support from the game makers either who seem to be on a mission to put off it's older users to the point of stopping them playing the game. Ps dont expect many players as a deception. Pps #saveferal",
        "First off, if you do not want duplicates, do _not_ spend any money on anything other than maybe another builder bot and don't waste any of your cyber coins on crystals until you get all of your builder bots.   So long as you don't care about getting dupes the game is fun. And you will get so very many many many dupes, often times the same bot in a row. Fortunately, the somewhat new cores help take away the pain of getting dupes.  Personally, I enjoy the strategic and alliance parts of this game a lot and the events are fun so long as you don't care about placement on the leaderboard. Having a good alliance helps a lot by the way. Don't be afraid to look around for ones that boot leaches."

Please look to make driving dial a bit larger, and a bit less sensitive, and possibly a 1 degree up or down feature, like the arrows  but a +1 or minus 1, as feature on present dial is too sensitive and does not adjust so refined.

I only have 200 coins daily, thus it isn't for buying songs, it's for just playing them. This update is a money-baiter. I got to say, this game really took a lot of work to Ubisoft and who am I to critize it. But I think that they should let us buy the songs. This game is really cool btw",

This actually isn't valid as I just looked at each option to buy and none give the option of no ads. Plus I've made purchases and still nothing. I just updated the app and received the option of no ads. I clicked it and paid to no avail. Email has already been sent about it.",
        "I really love this game. I downloaded it for mindless stress relief in between classes and it has not disappointed. Some of the levels are really tricky, I think in an attempt to get you to buy more balls. But that's not too much of a complaint. I bought the full version and it's worth it to be add free.",
        "Hi there! I love this game! Im on level1839 and my hubby says i have a problem bahaha. The only thing ive noticed is the levels seem to have stopped introducing challenges and are sometimes just not possible to beat without serious coin. But that doesn't mean I plan to stop anytime soon hahaha.",
        "It's an ok bubble blaster game, it has a lot of pop up ads. When you beat one level and move to the next there is always a 15 sec video. If your not on WiFi this will drag at your data",
        "While its addicting its quite easy. I've gotten 3 stars on every level and I've played over 200 levels already. Ive only had to replay a level that failed 3 or 4 times.",
        "This was fun... Until level 100 when they take away the ability to switch colors of the ball you're shooting. It makes it too difficult. I'm missing clearing it by one ball each time so then I'm watching ad after ad to avoid restarting the level. It's really disappointing how much that one thing has made me abandon the game and uninstall."

        "Amazing game!! I have purchased 1 or 2 bikes already, I would even pay to get new bikes, but it is very expensive. Please consider lowering to prices or making better bikes more accessible. Ive been stuck on the same level for 5 weeks. I want to continue playing but im loosing intrest not being able to advance. Maybe you could trade your old bikes in to get something in return for a newer bike. Im sure you will never read this, but you do have something special here! Thanks",
        "Very fun BMX pump game. Seen a few reviews say it's gets impossible after level 3 when it becomes pay to win. I don't agree I've just reached level 8 in a few hours. If you ride bikes off road and understand how to pump you'll love it",
        "Its way to hard to win and and the stats do nothing.  You have to be perfect and even then they fly by.  Still LOVE this game.  Just takes away the fun when you get left in the dust and you play the same lvl a million times hoping maybe one time you will be perfect.",
        "I loved this game for 3 days. Then it got to the point where I couldn't beat a level without upgrading my bike, but I couldn't upgrade my bike without spending real money. So disappointing. Don't waste your time if you don't want to spend real money!",
        "The game is fun up until around the third level. After that it becomes near impossible to win any races without spending actual money to upgrade your bike. Had a lot of fun with it up until that point, but it's definitely not worth spending actual money on. Deleted the game after pay to win clearly became a necessity.",
        "It was fun for a while - until it becomes impossible to beat any opponents with your current bike. The difficulty spikes around level 7 and the process of buying a new bike or upgrading your existing one becomes very frustrating, as you can't win any races to earn any money."

        "It's a fantastic game, nothing less than what I'd expected. The graphics were fantastic, the story engaging, the characters well developed. However, it was too difficult to earn the in game currency. Perhaps you could add in a video where the players are able to earn gems? Even if it's only once it twice a day, I'm sure it'll definitely help. All in all though, this was a great game as usual. Keep up the good work!",
        "I've been obsessed with Sherlock Holmes since I was about 7. Every incarnation of him, be it the books, the TV show or even the anime has left me completely in awe of Sherlock.  So I'm sad to say that I feel this falls short. As it's own game, it's great. I love the story and the characters are well developed. However, I went into it with a certain idea of how Sherlock should act, and it's not what I got. I understand why though, and it's not too distracting from the game. With that being said, I thoroughly enjoyed myself. The puzzles were a fun mechanic (a little easy for my liking, but still enjoyable) and the art style is really pleasing. Overall, I do think it's a game worth downloading.",
        "I really love it. Just like the other \"shall we date\" games you guys made. However, twice already did i not get my free SH points after doing the required action for it. Is there anything for that? Also if you guys are into the idea, you can do a free small amount of gems for watching an advertisement once every day or something? All the rest in the games you guys make is awesome and i love em all.",
        "The best Shall We Date game by far.  The characters are funny,  especially Sherlock and I love the plots.  If you can make Sebastian,  Jack, Hercule,  Jeremy and even Lestrade's routes it would be SUPER appreciated.  Omg, I think Lestrade's route would be the funniest because ALL of them would rip and mock him.  üòÇ  Update: I still think it's the best one.",
        "I just have to say: I love that the MC is not the usual cheerful idiot that somehow makes every guy fawn over her even though she can barely string a sentence together. This MC is portrayed as witty and intellegent as well as beautiful.  All the guys are also intellegent and quirky.  The stories are well written AND well edited. I never have trouble figuring out the plot due to poor grammar or translations.",
        "Great game, I think it's the best game shall we date had. Female lead is independent woman who doesn't make me wonder why everyone likes her. Guys are great as well, plus I absolutely the writing. It's probably the only game were I was bothered to play more than 3 routes"

        "Its a fun game. Still feel forced in the beginning to buy because ofbhow challenging and tough it is. But I think thats what I like about it; challenge.  but its a great game. Probably my favourite TF game. Hope to have new levels come out soon. Maybe another 100 or so? ;)  Update: I recently had to nuy a new phone. I thought meh, and started over again, but then I thought about it and I cant seem to find a way to recover my previous progression. It shows it in achievements but can not actually srart where I finished. Is there a way to do so? Thanks for the help.",
        "Pretty fun. Some levels are very hard and it is no so obvious how to win. VERY different than 1 and 2 where there was a clear logical way to win. Tournament level: I like the idea but some levels are sooooo hard I have no clue how to beat it! Overall fun and challenging!",
        "Freemium Alert!! The game itself is great. Until you get to around level 5 on the upgrades. Instead of coins, you start having to pay with crystals. This is where you have to start paying with real money to get crystals, to then get any further. Disappointing that you can't complete this with paying to win. Now feels like a waste of time.",
        "I got to the point where I couldn't move forward anymore without upgrades. I can do the tournaments to get items for upgrades but the tournaments were the same every week. Then BAM! They changed up the tournament for me and made it more challenging.  I love this game!",
        "I played this before a few years ago, have reinstalled and now it looks different but the same style.  However there are now now skull heads that instantly destroy your towers and you cant seem to avoid that.  The towers get knocked back for energy quicker than before as well.  The skull heads are the killer though as makes it impossible to win.",
        "Is a typical tower defense game... Bit. easier to learn and has it's own unique system for tower leveling... plus watch videos to earn points for the game got stuck and could not beat any of levels up for me top play.. restarted"

        "I had to change my rating for this game because I seriously believe it is rigged for me to stop advancing. Everything was great until I made it to pro level and now I'm noticing that whenever I am tied with another player with gems, an extra gem magically appears in the hole making me lose that round. How is it possible that I made it to pro level winning a good percentage of games and now I have played at least 50 rounds on level 3 and can't win a single one?",
        "A great app to download. Great format and graphics. Lots of fun and challenging. Rated everything 5 star other than gameplay. It's good but not great due to the water hazard or out of bounds shots.  Players can hit into the water yet still finish on par. Water hazard should automatically be 2 shots. If this gets changed it would be 5 star no doubt and best golf app.  Single mode would be fantastic to practise",
        "To many play just to attack your ball after you hit. Regardless if they don't play well they win. A bit eh. The way it's done barely allows you to win. I agree with many others reviews. Something fishy about the scoring system and who you are placed against. Won't keep long if it continues. Could be awesome if it wasn't unfair. O.o",
        "This game is ok at best. More about luck then skill. Fun and addictive, yes at times. Ive collected all the trophies from 3 of the maps and was on a roll. Then out of nowhere a 15 game lose streak. You will get to the point past anger. There are a lot of pretty good/lucky players from around the world.",
        "Overall, game quality is pretty solid. Few graphic glitches here and there but can be expected. It would be nice to rotate to see a better perspective and easier to hit.   One must improvement needed is that when you play a bot, it's way too noticable. You need to improve the bot intelligence! I understand why bots would be needed time to time.  Coins could be cheaper too.  EDIT: Game froze on a Pixel XL, cost me lots of coins! Not happy.",
        "Not bad. Sometimes freezes a little during game play but usually resolved itself. The wind is usually fair for each player's turn so that's good. Overall a good little time waster game. The only thing I would suggest is to make it a little easier/more often that gold bricks get collected. I've played for over a month now and got about 8 since starting."

        "MONEY HUNGRY! Play only if you intend to pay. Only got to the 4th it 5th puzzle and the only way I could continue was to pay! Don't misunderstand, this is a very good game. But unless you're willing to pay you have to wait for quite a while to get to play again. All of the Criminal Case games are the same way. Never been so blown away by a game insisting on paying money like this before. Very disappointed!",
        "Great gameplay. Colorful and vivid graphics. Smooth gameplay on LG Aristo 2. Been playing this a long time, took a break and came back. Why am I seeing Ads every minute in the game now ?!?!? I've never had that issue before at all. Now its Ads every minute !!",
        "Getting less fun than ever.  Pop up adverts in game very irritating.  Reported glitches in game to get response to follow self help which i already did.  Constantly bombarded by attempts to get you to spend money.     Used to be a great game by now would not recommend.  Will stop when i complete in 6 levels",
        "this game is so addicting. the only thing I hate is that they don't reward energy anymore. No drinks etc. I just wish you didn't have to buy energy to continue . otherwise I love this game. it's a great time consumer when you are borwd",
        "I played this game for a VERY long time. Recently, the creators have made lousy changes, making it difficult to get energy to play and giving us adults some stupid, useless stickers. Most of the regular players feel the changes are to force us to buy energy. Instead, many people are leaving the game, which is very unfortunate. Advertisers take notice! The creators aren't listening to the players and you may want to seriously consider before investing in this game."

        "This game is so much fun. Enjoyable, challenging and addicting. However the only problem with the game is the fact that in order to play the levels, you have to collect enough tokens to unlock them. Now this is fine, if there is something else to do in the game. But there isn't. You have to wait real time in order to play anything of the game. And there is no option to watch a video to gain 10 tokens. It straight up only allows you to buy tokens with actual currency. Micro transactions can be used as long as there is a way to play the game without them. But apart from that minor flaw. I cannot recommend the game enough as it's a challenging blast. Just a shame about the tokens.",
        "A fun game overall, but there are way too many ads. You can remove ads with a micro-transaction of buying tokens or coins, but I refuse to do that as I have more coins than I need as it is. As others have noted, it would be nice if your time-replenished tokens count was more than 10, as many puzzles cost more than 10 tokens to play. You can spend coins to replay a level and get more tokens, and there is a \"super-hard\" level in the main puzzle that is actually pretty easy and awards 3 tokens.",
        "Brilliant game and the only one I have found that doesn't auto fill the 'x' as you play. Perfect. However, as you progress the chance to get tokens reduces as the cost of each level goes up which means it takes days to get enough from daily bonus to play one level.  Pay wall doesn't pay out so waste of time. Very disappointing.",
        "The game is truly fun. Can't play very long because the tokens don't regenerate fast enough. I was winning tokens on some levels but since I purchased some tokens I haven't won a single one. Now that the tokens I paid for are gone I'm still not winning tokens (only coins, but it requires tokens to open the levels) so it's back to not being able to play very long",
        "This game was great untill it became unplayable. Every level or square on the puzzle needs to be unlocked with tokens. As you go through the game all levels start costing more and more tokens. At the start around 4 tokens per lv now after 234 puzzles 16 tokens. That is total b.s. so at best I can play a single game a day. So only play if your not planning on finishing or playing them a lot of money.",
        "The cells are too small to click on without accidently pressing the surrounding squares. Also, on the Galaxt S8 with the curved screen, the edge of the playing grid goes too far over the side of the phone, making it impossible to click on any of the cells in the last column."

No explanations on some features, you have to figure it out by trial and error wasting resources. I'm at castle level 15, dragon level makes no difference so far only troop level does. Events are useless because the top spenders take everything before you can even find the location. Misleading descriptions in-game costing you resources.

        "With daily events and online 3v3 matches; not to mention the addicitve meat farm and egg hatching. It's another GREAT game for the digimon fans, both new and old, to enjoy!   On a side note: I do wish they would add abit more to/continue the \"story mode\" but add abit of a cpu challenge to it.",
        "I love this game, I've been on almost everyday. It looks great, there are many Digivolution paths to take, and battling is a ton of fun. My only real complaint is the chat.. my friend and I use a private chat to talk all the time while waiting for stamina to recharge, but it's pretty buggy, censoring a lot of really common, non offensive words like anything with an \"ho\" or \"is\", and for some reason the word \"ready\" is censored too.. if this could be fixed, it would be great.",
        "It's a good game, really easy to play and yoy get the hang off it but one of my biggest complaint is the grind! The whole game is about grinding to get good digimon but the drop rates are so freaking low! The game would be more enjoyable if the rates were higher. I don't want to be spending so much time for me to save up stamina just for me to use it in seconds and get nothing. Hopefully they change it if not then this game is probably going to be forgotten soon",
        "Great works. As a big fan im really looking forward if Bandai can also bring back the classic old school dot digivice game into modern one. Not mmorpg.. But just that classic nostalgic dot nostalgic game. I really like digimon unlimited that a fan made before where we raise one digimon in many ways. Too bad its not bandai work. I definitely play if u make one",
        "The games is really fun and i love how the systems work. There are some issues however, for example WAY WAY WAY too grindy. Thats the biggest because during events you have to commit your life to the game to progress your gamestate. Additionally if you use stones in someone else's hosted co-op game they're gone despite it not being your fault and with the tiny amount of stones you get after 3 10 captures it adds up. Needs reworks but is good over all.",
        "Most people will say that it is kinda hard to get to mega. And I think they got a point but well in my own oppinion, this game comes with its own strength and weakness. I manage to get my rosemon and wargreymon and now I'm working on my taomon. My point is. This game is good overall but it can be better if there are feature that we can do to enhance our interaction with other player. A clan or guild or something like that. Keep ap the good work and I'm looking forward to the next update."

You can only buy hammers with gold which you only get TEN pieces per level no matter WHAT you score OR how many stars you get. And theres a lot of ads. Every time you you play a level.",

        "Awesome game, awesome graphics and gameplay! Controls I rated four stars due to sluggish firing it seems....or...it could be my device too. Im not exactly sure. Also, not a deal breaker, could we shut off the verbal commentary during battle and keep the sound effects? That'd be awesome. Great game all around though.",
        "When I first started playing this game a while ago it was great. Alot of fun. But after every update it gets less enjoyable. Originally gave it 5 stars but I honestly can't agree to that any more. Especially with the tokens and duplicate planes. I have no reason to spend any money, the tokens are useless and after 18 duplicate planes I just won't buy crates. Not worth it.",
        "Game is a POS. They used to work pretty well then they started upgrading everything and now it doesn't work hardly at all. Massive disconnects tons of unplayable lag. So far the only thing I found that works well in this game is the buy me button.. they don't seem to have a problem with that part of the game it works very well the rest of the game sucks.!",
        "I like this game, its the best WW2 Airfight game. I play many WW2 Airfight game in android, but this is the best one. Good Job War Wings. Can you make more than 4 vs 4 or 8 vs 8 in big map or something more than 4 vs 4? It will be look like war games not PVP, just advice. Keep the good work.",
        "The game is great but the enemy planes should have a health bar or something like that. You could also introduce clouds where there is almost no visibility and some power ups based on experience pts of a plane.. But still a really nice game"

        "You guys might want to consider making occasional, if not regular update for the game, especially on the events. At least keep up with the regular, basic ones. It was enjoyable. Missed the old days even tho so many changed drastically for good or for worst. The difficulty in everything is not really bothersome but if the minor rewards are slightly helpful, they could bring a fortune to you guys and us, players. Conclusion, please give us what we deserves üòä",
        "Great game but when i tried to use gems for instant research it didnt work and spent my gems and i tried to do it about 3 or 4 times and it spent all my gems without doing anything. I tried reopening the app and i tried resetting my phone too, to see if it was just a glitch. Please do something about this. I would like my gems back",
        "Used to be a decent game. The game developers have basically abandoned it and only use it to get cash on the side. No game updates for months. Small problems have been popping up now and then. Not worth the time, the game's just going downhill from here",
        "Too brutal and hardcore for new players. 100 times more powerfull players attack your base when you level up to lvl 6. You loose all you troops and you don't have food to develope new troops and it takes forever to get enough food and train new forces. And you are attacked again and so on. Unistalled game right after that. Alliance is no help.  They have copied whole game from the Zgirls game. Just a little different graphics",
        "Loved the game, except for the bi-weekly slaughter fest, until they stopped updating the game and stopped supporting the players. Spent money to upgrade the bank, but it keeps reverting back to level 0. Been trying to get it unlocked for weeks, but support doesn't respond. Don't waste your time and especially don't put any money into the game!"

        "This game is quite relaxing and can be competitive at the same time. It's a good game for you to chill.  Hi gamegos, could you do something about the accidental purchase? Example: upgrading fridge, adding order to telephone system. The button can easily clicked and cause the time spent to earn cash gone within seconds. Thanks.",
        "I love this game it serves us my boredom reliever. I love the graphics the design and all. My complain is only about the vouchers and the expansion problem Can u please give us lot of expansion voucher bcoz i always use my cash to expand my cafe. U know that it is very hard to earn a cash. And can you lower the prices of avatar like 50 cash only bcoz 100 cash is too much.  Thank you i hope you can consider my request",
        "Amazingly fun and addicting! But really needs a confirmation button for spending cash (\"Are you sure you'd like to spend X cash?\") There are buttons everywhere and I've already wasted so much cash by pure accident. That's my only complaint though :)",
        "Love this game spent some money on it but still very fun.  They do specials on packages pretty cheap that speed things up.  Has a lot to do in it too doesnt get boring.  Good if you have a long time to play or just a couple minutes.",
        "The game is great, reminds me of chefville that truly will be missed forever... I just dont like the fact that you need to spend quite a bit of money to really enjoy it... That is the reason I will probably quit it. :( If you dont start spending money it will be really hard to expand, you wont be able to build machines and that is the reason customers will leave negative comments... And some of the coments you get from customers are really mean and offensive... I wish they were more subtle. The prizes you can win by watching ads and inviting celebrities over are usually not helpful and dont change the situation that much. Like I said, you MUST spend money to enjoy the game. It is a great option for those who have money to throw away on frivoulus things...",
        "Game is fun, but its hard to get all that the game has to offer without spending some real money.  Not sure if I'm going to continue"

Upgrades cost a fortune and collecting boxes are few and far between and earning cash with off-road challenges is just a drop in the bucket of money you'll need for an upgrade. I'm not saying everything should be cheap and easy, but should increase cash values or offer other ways to earn cash.",

And the camera (free camera) followed the truck perfectly in order to see the suspension moving with the terain. Now the camera does not stay where you want it. Now it moves out of place in (free camera) because it touches rocks, trees etc. Physics have become so fake. Please change back the camara and physics. I unistalled other games because this is all I spent time with. But now I dont know?",
        "nice! im waiting for long time for the game like this... and this is it. but, please add more common truck like nissan navara, toyota hilux vigo & revo, mitsubishi triton, ford ranger 3.2, isuzu dmax.. and also please fix the mud graphic to more realistic.. thanks..",
        "Hey devs, great game, I think a winter map or just more maps would be awesome as well as an option to sell vehicles rather than just collect them. Overall I gave everything but the controls 5 stars becuase id like to see custom placement of things like the gas, break, shifter, etc. Great job overall",
        "This game suck because it never work it always lags out and every time it says loading trailer it goes back to my home screen. In my review i mean all of this and hope ypu make your game better so it doesn't suck but for now it does suck.",
        "This game is literally what I have been looking for. This is the perfect offroad game. I just wish that there were A LOT more maps and vehicles to chose from. It's boring to constantly go to the same maps. Also the multiplayer is pretty fun. Expand the maps and create new ones please!"

Just name a feature and you can be sure that it's been screwed up. Just hope they resolve this the next year. Will just uninstall till the new yearly reset.",

        "I can't see myself EVER giving EA mobile games anything but a 1 star rating, the game is geared to cheat unless you're spending actual $ on paccs & players. How many times can an event rob you of stamina to only rob you again by redundantly giving you the same fucc'n collectables over & over & over again!!! By the time you actually complete the set either the seasons over, or there's better players @ the position that you'll probably never end up getting either... Unless you spend some cash. EA succs man, SINCERELY!!!",

This is so very very bad news with you EA. If you still use this rule, i think... this game can be game over forever. You should back this rule like before. if you can't, everymonts, weeks, days, hours, or minutes, this rating of Nbalivemobile always down, decrease, and fall, hopefully you can understand if you feel this game very important for you! Trust me!. Thank you. Tru",
        "EA, the game is official and is above average as far as graphics, gameplay go etc. etc. but food for thought and I think it'll be a gamechanger really...it'll take the game to new heights on a consumer level.

        "The game is fun to play casually. Just open it up a few times a day and level up the heroes or whatever. Now whenever I open the app, it functions the same except the graphics are glitched out. Some icons are missing completely. It is making me not want to play it as often. Wish I knew what to do to fix it. Tried reinstalling it, and that fixed it for a few hours.",
        "The game itself is fun, but there are two major bugs I ran into that ruined the gameplay:  1. Starting at zone 500, some of the idle ancients stop working entirely. Then when you reset after reaching 500, they continue to not work even at earlier waves. Incredibly disappointing.   2. When I spent 500 rubies to activate the \"double damage permanently,\" it immediately and permanently reduced my damage output 10x. Ruined all my progress and wasted my rubies.  Fix those two things and you've got yourself an excellent game.",
        "I'd give five stars except for a serious bug after about zone 130. The idea is that your heroes fight for you while your away, so you progress a bit while you're not actually playing. That's the nature of clicker games. This works as expected before zone 130, but after 130 it glitches a lot, removing a lot of your current progress.   It seems to only remember cleared zones, but not the progress within zones. For example, if I'm on zone 181 and it's moving at a rate where it looks like it would clear the zone after 20 minutes, it will reset the zone to zero if I open the app before that. Oddly, it still pays out the gold, but the progress is lost.",
        "It's really nice not too laggy at all. You get new characters all the time to help tour team and upgrade them. And it's very fun to get a boss so much gold and if your away for 2 days for example you wold come back and the monsters would keep dieing.",
        "Use to play it years ago, tryed it again now. Transcend and that Ponyboy really ruined the game I think. Progression is oversimplified and lightning fast to a point it doesn't feel fun for me at all. There is one build that is way to obvious and better then anything else.",
        "Ads are a scam. They say they'll give you 25 rubies for watching an ad but then try to change it to 5 rubies"
