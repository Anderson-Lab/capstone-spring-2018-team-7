        "I hope you take the time to read.   This game is amazing, and it just keeps getting better. I do wish you would change the video knives to apples or video. Now I have nothing to spend apples on.  But here is what i really wanted to say i really like this company and the games you put out to your users. I'm newly paralyzed and I been well adapting to my new life and because my hands dont work like they used to these games kept my mind busy and has helped me. I own alot of your games and have spent alot trying to help. I wish I had more to unlock things in time. But Thank you very much.",
        "The game sucks it's alwful. It's gliching non stop for your bad. There are ADS everywhere! Ketchapp you getting worse and worse. There are ads of stupid games everywhere. What a game maker will pay to another game to show them in ADS! That makes the game in the ad even worse. Please ketchapp I was a big fan of you but you made your games so STUPIT. PLEASE FIX YOUR GAMES!",
        "Ads interrupt gameplay and are extremely aggravating. The video that you have to watch to continue your gameplay never works. The game crashes when xp increases. I personally dislike this game, and it would be better if these issues were resolved. Thank you for taking time out of your day to read this review.",
        "I like the game, BUT it is glitchy. Most of the time when I hit \"continue\" to watch an ad for longer gameplay it freezes, so I have to close the app and start over. When I open the app and start playing the first round, an ad pops up and I inevitably click on it because I'm in the middle of playing the round. Please fix these issues, and I'll try to remember to rate this higher once they're fixed.",
        "Deleted all my data with no reason. Had a bunch of Legendaries and Rares that have now been deleted. I put a lot of time into this game, and even bought the ad-free package. If you don't want a load of wasted time, don't download this app.  Edit- Updated the app and levelled up a bit. The game crashes every time I get a free revive. Still a massive waste of time.",
        "The game was amazing! There was only 1 problem. Sometimes when i  started a game in the middle of it, it would just show an ad and it would make me lose. Unless you fix this my rating will be 4 stars. Fix this and the rate will be 5 stars"

        "I'll get the negative part done 1st. I'd give this 5 stars if there weren't so many ads!!! For the amount of time you actually get a turn, 30 seconds ads in between every turn is a bit much.  Outside of that this is a very fun addictive game.  Note to new players. Although the ball travels better with a perfect hit, there are too many obstacles if you got straight down the middle. Better to hit just left or right of all that.",
        "Needs way more bats i beat this in 3 days and can't get the ball any farther. Add more bats and I'll give 5 stars.  Update: need to make the bats harder to get i already had all the new ones unlocked when i opened the app after the update. Litterally took one swing with the now highest bat and now there is no point to play.  You should make it like 5,000 km for the next update or something.",
        "I think this game is GREAT and pretty fun but there is some things that I don't like about this game for example THERE IS TO MUCH ADS!!!! not just that but also when you do it perfect it goes straight right??? Well hitting perfect actually sucks because if you go to the middle EVERYTHING is in your way I'd rather hit it on the left or right.",
        "Need improvements! First of all, when you will make a perfect hit the chances are 99% that you will hit an obstacle. Secondly, there is no sound.Developers put different sound modes/effects based on the tipe of the bat and some background music! Finally, I think that the game is good and addictive but it needs improvements! üëç‚öæÔ∏èüèè",
        "It's a very simple game, kind of has potential but not a whole lot. There's way too many ads, it feels more like an advertisement trap than a game at times. The ads pop up at inconvenient times and interfere with gameplay. If you have absolutely nothing better to do, then install. If you have literally anything else to do, it's a waste of time",
        "It's fun. But an ad after every attempt is rediculous. I get the developer wants to make money but when you can't play the game without a 30 second ad after every attempt it makes it hard to play. Playing in airplane mode gets rid of the ads and it's fun to play that way. Reduce the number of ads and this game will be better."

It's only happened once to me and I'm on level 41. Now that's saying something. It gives you a super good promise and nope it's gone out the window as soon as you get the game",
        "I have been playing for a while now, I like almost all of the game, not too impressed that \"the piggy bank \" is basically held to ransom until you buy it... find another way to entice spending... reduce number of coins won or something but as the levels get hard if you dont spend money you get stuck even with team helps.. it gets disheartening and reduces interest after a while.. to the gamemakers: keep the game playable..the money will come",
        "Although this game is addictive and sometimes fun, it seems the producers of the game are greedily taking advantage of people and getting them to pay money for things not worth it(but they feel the pressure to do so, so they do it). Some things in this game are deliberately set up to make the player fail and become desperate to play on and spend. The Champions League is a poor idea which produces terrible prizes for high ranks, and is just a replay of previous played levels which is a let down.",
        "Update...as I go though the levels Ill get stuck for a day or two...even 3 on a level. Gameplay FUN has Dropped significantly. Moved to 3 stars as a result. If it does not change I'll continue to move to 1 star. Games are many to be played...not just stuck on a level forever!  Other issue with the game is that there's so much clicking and waiting once you win. I wish that it would just go right to the next level and it wouldn't have to wait for the splash screen. I just spend so much time wasted versus playing",
        "It's fast and fun so much better than the other new ones. I love playing it. Thank u so much for all your work and the time spent making it a blast to play.  PS getting past level 80 isn't  possible so I quit. Made me so sad.",
        "Don't waste your time playing this game.  I got too 300 + levels but you get 100 coins for completing each level.  Unfortunately it goes in a piggy bank, which you need to pay to break starting from ¬£1.99, then next piggy bank was ¬£4.99.  It's a con!"

It has cute graphics and runs smooth. I just cant get enough. As far as scary no not scary a little like whoa they're gunna hit.. Oh wait phew how did they not hit? RGB keep up the good work with this game and all your other free stuff! You guys make great games for all ages!",

I certainly am inlove with the music. Please put a soundtrack on youtube, I would love to listen to it !! Thank you creators of the game, I enjoy playing it so much, and I do hope that there's more.",

        "This game has alot of benefits, especially, the decision making, plan ahead, multi tasking, pattern recognition and many more. Thank to this game, its very addictive, plain and simple, make you relax and it doesnt stress. Deserve to be 5 star."

Getting kinda frustrating and just not worth watch the ads anymore. Can you fix this? If not, I more than likely will delete the app and free up the space.",
        "this game is slightly good but  it is lost its priority to me day by day. initially this game was awesome but now a days it seems to me boring, authority takes this game only for business purpose. after finishing level 30 i lost my patience to this game. it gave more ad. but not increase their game quality. so finally i take decision to uninstall this app to release the space of phone.",

        "I can't even play, cause this is a bad day. And this makes it worse, its like seeing a bad nurse. I don't like it, it works for a bit. I don't like trash games, but it is not my fault I am calling it names. Fix it, or people get this bit. This is what I wrote, now write a note. Write a note about my problem, and stop em.",
        "You think if you have your Facebook added to the game if you get a new smart phone. Your info well transfer over the player you earn. And coins. But the don't so I won't ask my friends to play it till you fix this problem.",
        "I think its a good time killer, but it gets repetitive. They need to add new cities and characters because they did Tokyo already and they brought it back. It also glitches and it feels like every time I lose there is an ad. But other than that, the graphics and gameplay are amazing. Good job, just put in a little more variety."

        "Good but ¬£4 is a lot to not quite remove all the add. Some pictures are still locked behind and walls. Easy enough to unlock but for the price id expected all add to be removed. Also really would like the pictures to be sortable by category with more fantasy and space stuff in the complex pictures. Also there appears to be no way to sync pictures across devices. If I've paid ¬£4 I should be able to switch between the phone and tablet at will. Both are android.",
        "I love it very much. I also have some sugjestons to make. I think you should make categories for Thu pictures (animals,people,food,ect) and also have a daily challenge where you have to finish a picture (that you say) and we have to finish it. You would get a prize of a amount of coins and you could save them up to buy new pictures or tools like the bomb. But i really like this game. So even if you don't do my sugjestons I will still love it. ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§",
        "In my humble opinion, this game is truly a work of art and talent. This game can be used by people of all skill levels, due to the variations of complexity and difficulty within each pixel art piece. And it's just bursting and overflowing with hundreds, maybe even thousands of art pieces. There are hours of fun and relaxation awaiting you, and what a way it is to pass the time. Even better, it is appropriate for ages of all kind, including small children.Overall, I recommend this to anyone willing, for this is truly glorious.",
        "AMAZING GAME! I am SOOOOOO HAPPY with this game! ITS SOO ADDICTIVE TO PLAY! SOOO MANY PICTURES TO CHOOSE FROM! THERE'S EVEN A TRUMP ONE(which is EXTREMELY funny)! THIS IS THE-BEST-GAME-EVER THAT I HAVE PLAYED!I LOVE THIS GAME SOOO MUCH THAT YOU, YES YOU, SHOULD GO DOWNLOAD PIXEL  ART RIGHT NOW! YES RIGHT NOW! SO GO AHEAD AND DOWNLOAD IT!!! (also this is the longest thing i have EVER typed on my phone!)",
        "I love this game! There are so many pictures to color! This game will keep me occupied for hours! I just love how creative they are! But one question...Why do more pictures come by and take the place of my new colored ones? Like, why do more pictures come by everyday? It's kind of frustrating to color the new ones and then more appear the next day. Please fix, or stop the glitch. Overall, great game.‚ò∫",
        "I love this game and both myself n my grandbabies love doing the pics. It would b awsome to have n categories or level of pic. Didn't know about the bomb and other help. I would also suggest to move or when u r doing pic for the back button n save button to hide . I'm always intrupting my pic by hitting the by accident . N also to b able to open the pic at a spot by touches instead of expanding pic. Expecially for more detailed pics. Love it Ty ."

        "There is just to much to say about this brilliant, creative, and fun game! It keeps me busy while im bored and on a road trip! I saw an ad for this on instagram and decided to download it, and let me tell you I was not disappointed with the outcome. I've been seraching for games like this and I have finally come across such a fantastic game! The Fluffy charectors should be sold as toys because of their adorable look!",
        "I have just one piece of criticism... How is it that you're not selling these things as toys??? I want, like, all of them. For the love of God, make a Kickstarter if you must, but you need to make real Fluffies and sell them right now! The game's great, by the way, although I wish the Fluffy didn't cover the view so much, and I also wish the rainbow system thing was better explained, because I have no idea how it works. Keep it up!",
        "I love Fluffy Fall so much!! It is SUPER kawaii, fun, fuzzy, and enjoyable. It takes up your time as you try to beat your highscore!! Mine is 45.  I am really hoping that it updates, because I want all the monthly gem stones to be in stone section. I think it would be cool to have my gem stone. And play as it.  Anyways, I really love the game, it is so amazing!! If you love kawaii and fun games, get Fluffy Fall!!! üòäüíï",
        "Absolutely Love this! I've only been playing for at least an hour but it's so unbelievably adorable! I always try sticking with adventure games but any game with cute little puffblocks are always gonna be tested as well, I definitely recommend people of all ages to play üòÅ",
        "It's adorable, plays well, wonderful to waste a few hours on. HOWEVER,  The special effects each cube is supposed to do doesn't. The Dice is supposed to change to random fluffies, and literally all of them are supposed to put more gold in the tubes. Neither of those things happen?",
        "I love this, the achievements and different types of characters are great, the only the that sucked for me was the music. I wish there was at least more variety because the song that plays throughout the menu and game isn't that good + it gets old."

        "Latest update: The agressive pop up ads are gone and have been replaced by video ads. Even when connected to mobile data services. I wouldn't say this is an improvement. Draining my data volume for advertisement is not nice. It's just greedy. This app is producing so much money anyways, why video ads? Wouldn't normal images be enough?  Update: The agressive advertisement is back and it's worse than ever. There are huge amounts of unauthorised browser popups partly midgame and even when the app is simply running in the background. This needs to be addressed!  Earlier: I like this app a lot. The concept behind it is great and it's great fun to play. The questions are mostly balanced aside from the annoyingly football heavy sports category. Lately though the app kept opening up dubious websitest, usually at the beginning of a round. This is absolutely untolerable (!). It should not have the permission to do this. I've been hoping for the latest fee updates to fix this - they didn't.",

        "Unless you have 16 hrs a day to put into this game to learn the track you will never have a very high score. Sometimes your vehicle doesnt respond the same as other runs also you may land on your tail and survive and the next time you die its up and down with the control if you keep going or die. And sometimes it tries to flip when you try to take off resulting in a quick death",
        "Would and will give 5 star. But would like to see a gem counter. It gets rather tough keeping count.  Also I noticed sometimes that when come across the areas that have the 4-5 flat spiked walls that you have to time just right. When I die and revive they all seem to sync up together making it impossible to go under. I'll try and screenshot it next time. All in all great job and awesome game. Maybe a custom map feature for future. Possibly added to the no ads fee. Would be worth it then.",
        "This game is my favorite game ever. The graphics are amazing, the controls are great. I can't seem to find anything wrong with this game. Me and my brother love playing it. I also like that it is available on Google Play Store and the Appstore on iPhones. My old phone was an iPhone, and when I got my new phone I was worried that I wouldn't be able to play it, but thanks to Ketchapp and Google Play Store, I can still play it!! Also, I would like to suggest that you add a feature that allows you to create your own level, but it's not something you have to add, it's just something I think would make the game absolutely perfect for me. Then again, you may already have that feature and I haven't seen it/gotten to it yet. Anyway, it's an amazing game, and I hope Ketchapp keeps making amazing games like this!!! (BTW, Ketchapp games are my absolute FAV.) Thank you!! üöòüòäüöò",
        "This game would be great if it wasn't so laggy. Usually I would think it was an issue with phone storage or something, but I am on a new phone (note 8) and have only added a few apps in total. The game was smooth the first day or two but now the speed changes throughout play. The levels become impossible because the clock doesn't slow down even though the movement of the bike does.   Great concept and design. Hopefully that can be figured out if it is an issue on their side.",
        "The game is great fun. I have been playing it for a few months and actually still play it. The only problem i seem to have with it. Is the laggish performance when i am connected to internet. The moment the internet is off then game runs more smoothly other than that. Still enjoy playing it. Though I must say it would be nice if there was a gem counter for each ride so i know how many I have collected. Otherwise great game",
        "Love it. Only thing is there is a glitch when you watch an ad for 200 thingy things you get a menu that lets you get 200 more. Than again, than again. Its better on our side than yours but it would be a good fox so you have to earn them! I love all your games, wish I had all of them but I have limited storage!"

Along with finishing a constant 16th about 95% of the time make me think it's rigged. What's up with that??",

There is no in between you either win or you finish 14th or lower. You have 30 pts lead in front of number 2. after 1st round, you slightly fail your 2nd jump, guess what? 18th place for you! If you jump for example 120m on a K90 in Q, you finish first because everyone jumped 20m less, sudennly in 1st round you need 130m to secure your first place because everone managed to jump extra 30m. All in all fun, but still needs a lot.",

The fun of the game turns to frustration as you get good distance and terrible scores, but why? You assume landings but the game gives you no information on correct technique. Also same for takeoff and mid air lift.   Come on devs its lazy and ruining a game with huge potential. Uninstalled...",

Its a multiplayer game and It's in my opinion that It is probibly #2 best game I've ever played. Great concept and I like to get creative on makeing a snake/worm thing. A+ grade. üëåüëç",
        "The controls are more difficult than the last time I played this game, which was a year or so ago. The new customization is very cool üëå but the fact that even the joystick (my usual preference) doesn't make it better at controlling. I don't know whether it is because of my phone or if it is in the app. Nevertheless good job, game is very addictive, keep up the good work üëå",
        "this game is a thousand times better than agar.io in my opinion! It's so much easier to get onto the leader board. Every time I play I get onto the leader board. It's just so addicting and I can't get enough. Everyone in my family loves it too. Creating your own skin is a great option as well. My only complaint is that the 'play online' option is very laggy, and if you fix it would be much appreciated. Thanks for a great game, from sin√©ad, ella, lauren, mollie, shane and ollie üòäüòä",
        "Should allow us to be able to control the speed with a bar level instead of the button. Should make online controllers like offlines. Faster and more sensitive to move. And add a special rare star that floats around the screen rarely that doubles your size by eating it. No matter how big you are. That would be interesting.",

Bcoz most of the player i encounter is mexecan or spanish.. 1 more thing i hope you add a larger map i guess for team battle i think 4km x 4km is enough.. And 30mins of total playing time.. All in all fantastic game.. A two thumbs up for you guys. Keep it up",
        "I could have given five stars. The only problem is the number of players per drop/game. Please change it to 80 to 100 range. Pretty sure youll have a lot of players and ill be glad to recommend it in my facebook page if youll be able to increase the max players. It tends to become boring when you see only 12 players left when the safe zone did not even appear yet. You will look like a rat looking for a cheese around the map. More players means more fun. If you'll take this suggestion seriously, you will thank me later.",

        "The best survivor royale esque game you can find on the play store. Takes up immensely less space than others like Rules of Survival. Anyone can play this, no matter the quality of their phone. It's intense solo, duo, and squad gameplay will always have you coming back to take a shot (no pun intended) at another win. An amazing feature is it's voice chat communication system. You can talk to your teammates (though unfortunately, I find most players speak Spanish. You may have more luck.) though i wish there was a text chat as well. It will hopefully come in the next update, bur I would definitely recommend getting this game. My only other suggestion is new maps, a night mode, more weapons, and attachments.",
        "This is a really great game, I think it can go to heights where it'll have a PC version with a bigger city, more weapon's and kill tactics. It should really consider creating a store which has more item's though . Also can you add gas cans strategicallyy to the game, I'd love to blow up someone hiding in a factory :) . Other than that, its a gteT game , I'm at Level 13  and have tons of kills already in all modes so I figured you deserve a review at this point.   Keep up the great work, I love this game so far.",
        "good game. but I think u garena should add more trees, buildings, and others. and I thinks its good if we can play 5-10 players in one team in squad game cause in GUILD the max. members're 20 players. sorry for my bad english"

And then you have that \"Aha\" moment. There it is.  The trap is set. Lol you are not continuing to play because it is addictive. You play in order to collect coins so you can buy stuff to make the little fish happy. üíò the graphics kind of a little like an underwater Farmville with the plants üêü and decorations you can get fort your aquarium. I do play with üé∂ turned off. Cute game so far.        Graphics make it better than Candy Crush.",
        "With an easy guide, on 'How to play'. Once you get going its great fun. Dare I say quite addictive. Fantastic animations. Amazing back ground music. Plus, no app freezes either.  Its an 'A‚òÜ' from me at least.  Only, what would be a great idea. Is all the piggy bank jewels you build up, should be awarded for your hard efforts. Should not have to buy them back.  Only purchase jewels when desperate.",
        "Great game. Challenging, fun, and addictive lol. I'm 32 and play this often so it's not just for kids . Give it a try it's very satisfying . Just wished you could add friends ... People that play whom you may not know so we all could help each other. That would make it more interactive and a lot more fun. No one I know plays so it would have to be other fellow fishermen üòâ",
        "Fantastic game! It's great fun decorating the aqariums and the game board is very clear. The recent move of the boosters to the right hand side of the screen was a VERY bad decision, as I have accidentally used them when my hand has brushed against them - this has happened many times already. A good addition would be a marker indicating a purchased item.",
        "Because you only get 5 lives and you make some levels with too few moves. It would be nice if you could interact more with your fish and tanks. The whole point of beating levels is to build up your tanks...but you can't do anything with them while waiting for lives. It would be a fantastic game if there was more to do within the tanks!",
        "I Loooove Fishdom!!!üòÅ I'm absolutely addicted to this wonderfully fun & challenging game. The graphics are very cute & entertaining. The only issue i have is that I'm up in levels 180+ & there's just NO way to make the amount of coins to purchase ALL the decos/plants i earn. Most are priced too high."

Thank you my supercell friend.this game oh almost,st forgot.bbbbbbbeest 2 v 2 game on mobile,!!!!!",
        "I don't think I need to 'review' much here. There are some points I definitely don't like about the game. Such as the matchmaking... You get matched with the same deck type in a row. Other than that and some minor flaws it's a great game. I love the competitive aspect about it.  Finally I would suggest some 2v2 with different game modes, such as ramp up 2v2. Also, add the rematch button in 2v2 challenges with random mates.  Hope I hit the 4,3k this season. Good luck to all clashers!",
        "I think Clash Royale is a great game to play and is very well put together for all ages, it is a fast paced game and at the same time can be played with an individual pace of your own to a degree being that there is a clock ticking, also new characters are released at a well balanced rate, so that the game doesn't become boring and the regular balance of the characters strengths and weaknesses are balanced to make the game more competitive. I recommend this game for all ages and abilities. It's great for a few minutes or an hour or so and this game also has several different tournaments you can enjoy yourself or with a friend or a teammate. See you soon on Clash Royale. A.K.A. Dad.",
        "I m lucky enough!!!!!  I just started playing 8 months ago and now I earn 7 legendaries in total and 2 of them are lvl2 where as my friend is playing since more than a year he owes only 6 legendaries and 1 of them is lvl 2..... So plz do something about this we(gamers) expect better from u  Plz don't disappoint them who has low no.s of legendaries....... This is request from all guys who have not got luck in this game I guess...",
        "Well after playing it for so many months. It now has not let me play for about a  week out of no where, it loads to 50% and then it asks to try again later I have uninstalled it many times and retried time after time. All of my other games work just not this one. Don't really know what to do. It sucks because this is my favorite game too.",
        "Supercell, I think your best game is hay day. Clash royale on the other hand isn't one of your better games. Android is better than apple. Why would you ever support apple instead of android. You released Brawl Stars only for apple. You should have less medieval/fantasy games unless you make the knights, princes etc. More realistic. In my opinion I think you're better at making farm and army games. Please make more of thoseüòñ"

        "So I played it on my iPhone e and loved it. Recently o got a new phone and it's am android. I connected to my Nintendo account and loaded it up. My world seem to be it good shape everything there like in my IPhone but when I went to tour only world one was available. I'm not going to spend another ten dollars to unlock what I already beat so please fix it I wanna keep enjoying this gamr",
        "Love this game and love the nostalgia but there is no way I'm paying ¬£9.99 to level up on any game ever let alone one where a single tap on the screen is the only player interaction. Even with direction control etc like the old days wouldn't make it worth the price being asked.",
        "I have had a very long conversation with someone at the hq and I was talking about the worlds. I bought the worlds on my iPad and downloaded Mario run on this device Android. I ask why my worlds that I purchased on my iPad aren't here. They don't connect that purchase with Nintendo account. When they connect everything else. I told them I am not paying twice so that brings down the rating for me for this game. But great fun and very enjoyable, but get the linking fixed. Seems a bit of a design flaw",
        "I love Mario games. I always think they are fun while challenging. It is UNREASONABLE that you have to purchase the second world and the rest of the worlds. You only have one world that you don't pay for. I get people need money and apps are a great way to get them but you could at least have a bundle that everyone wants. I only play remix 10. Because it's FREE.",
        "This would have got 5 stars had I been able to share it with my 2 kids via family share. I refuse to pay ¬£30 for all 3 of us to have access to all the levels.  Great game though. Fun, quick and easy to play. Many hours spent between us. So many levels too.",
        "I'd say it's worth it even as a free game.  It's a fun game to kill time. Even if you run out of tickets there's many ways you can earn more on the free side. To purchase at 10 bucks the play becomes almost non stop. Good buy, good time killer, challenging, and overall enjoyable game, free or paid for.  5 stars from me."

        "Better game than the other similar. I know the other game was first, but they want you to pay hundreds of dollars upfront so you start at similar pace as this one. Or wait long time, and span of that game is years! Whilst this game is fast to start, cheap, and at free play you can beat it in months, while if you spend a couple of bucks, you can beat it in days, at the most weeks. So basically they sell out this genre for a few bucks, and good riddance! It was fun for a few days, spend few bucks to beat it in few more days, or wait a bit. And thats that. It is, how it is suppose to be.",
        "This app is quite addictive and fun! Not to mention how much of a time killer it is! It's cool to see how far you can get, upgrading and collecting money until you can reset for fame! I like the whole concept of the resetting for fame but it doesn't really make sense.. but don't mind that, it's just a game after all! I am having fun with the app so far, but I might get bored of it later. We'll see I guess! :-)",
        "I love who you added as the workers! I not good with comics or super heros but i think thats stanley? And i love how you added chef Gordon Ramsay! If you update this game i have 1 question, can the tech manager of the second floor be steve jobs?",
        "Good game, but they're some bugs that need sorting out. At random times the game just cuts off, sometimes when you are loading up the game it say ooops something went wrong write an email, Evan some of the videos freeze up or just shuts everything down. I would be happy if I could play the game without any problems at all. Thank you for your time and patients. Have a good day.",
        "Latest update messed up the game. Went to black screen that says debug. Uninstall/reinstall fixed it but now it says to update the game. When I click ok, it brings me to the game store, but no update is available.",
        "Tap your screen. Wait. Tap some more. Wait. Watch some ads and hope they don't freeze for a minute. More waiting. You're going to delete it eventually, just don't bother.  Reply: If real life were as banal and buggy as this game, I would have drunk a bleach smoothie by now."

        "Good game to pass your time. Upgrade costs and parts spawn rates are reasonable if you only use a few vehicles because it will take a long to yo max out everything. I think it will be better if league vs trophies distribution are reworked because its very easy yo reach legends. should give a higher win bonus at higher trophies i think to make it more competitive. And lastly, hackers should be deleted from leaderbord.. there are a few impossible timings on the board.",
        "I enjoy the game greatly. It's slightly different with  the chest and stuff but it is sure nice to get bonuses every now and than. There are new adds though which I'm not super stoked about like the brake time adds but they keep them short and can be skipped quick if you have already watched them. All and all great game",
        "I love this game. Every game I've had, I played for a week or so, and uninstalled. But this one? Ive had for almost 6 months. Been playing every single day. Finally reached legendary 32, I've unlocked everything. I love the VIP subscription and upgrades it gives you. I would like atleast one new vehicle option every month or so. Or at least a new adventure spot. Making a modded version of the rally car would be fantastic. Also, an upgrade on the formula car where it doesn't almost dead stop after it lands from a big air.",
        "If you don't want to give away free stuff from the chests, don't. But stop wasting my damn giving me these \"free\" coins for watching a video only to have the ad freeze %95 of the time. The are plenty of other free games out there, might be time for a change.",
        "Constant ads.  Excruciatingly slow progression unless you pay.  Game crashes more than I crash in the game.  Could have been a great sequel to HCR 1, but it feels like playing a money-grab instead.",
        "Superb game! Too bad, the elements of hate like to hack good things and cause frustrations. For this reason, constantly run constant updates. I wouldn't mind paying through my rather expensive data to diffuse the damage by these bored, small prick nincompoops! Africaüòùüòùüòù"

        "Ads after ever single try, even if you only play for 5 seconds before you die. If you're trying to complete a challenge, every couple tries it will reset to free play mode and you have to go intentionally kill yourself which sometimes takes way too long. Then if you don't tap the challenge button exactly right, you have to free play again. Then every time you get back into the challenge screen, you have to scroll all the way through every one you've completed. The game would be fun if it wasn't so infuriating.",
        "I paid the 2 odd dollars to remove the ads since i really enjoyed the game. If you are thinking about doing the same DON'T. Paying the money removes ZERO ads. It simply allows you to skip most of them after 5 to 10 seconds rather than watching the whole 20 to 30 second ad. They still pop up just as often and are just as annoying. Personally I would wait for another developer to make a good clone of the game, shouldn't take long it's a simple engine.",
        "I paid the price to get the ads removed, because I like to support developers and because there were a LOT of ads. The ads were never removed. I have contacted the developers more than once and received no response. Then I contacted the Play Store and they rejected my claim. Now I have paid for the ads to be removed and they are still there at a level that makes the game unplayable. Worst customer service ever; what a waste of money. I will remember this developer and never download another of their apps.",
        "Terrible game. I can't pay twice without having to sit through a full 30 second add. I found it faster to exit out the app and go back in to avoid adds. But there are just too many adds that it made it not fun after the first few goes.",
        "WAY TOO MANY ADS! Its so frustrating that after three failures an ad plays for 30 seconds. Also, why are you asking for access to my storage and location and the ability to make and receive calls? As a developer, get with what your customers want. Then I'll consider buying something.",
        "Far too many ads. One here and there is understandable but after every single try, you get an add. Definitely uninstalled for that reason. As far as the game itself, it's really fun and could be addicting but I spent more time trying to get through the ads than I did playing the game."

        "I Love Everything About This Game. I Can Upgrade Everything and Get Far. I Save Soooooo Much Money And I Can Learn Quickly How To Cook & Level Up Very Fast. Before I Switched Over To A New Phone Plan I Realized A Very Awesome Little Technique They Have. If You Have A Connected Account No Matter What Phone You Get Your Levels Will Be Stored & Saved. I Was So Shocked. Overall I Love This Game. Most Definitely Will Recommend.",
        "I think it would be better if you got more gems. You can barely win anything on that little slot machine. I also noticed that you no longer get gems for every day you log in to play. Sure, the money is nice but you can't upgrade with just the money you earn while playing. I spun that slot machine 80 plus spins and barely won anything. Do the gems even pop up as a winning combo? They used to but not anymore.",
        "I like the mobile version better than the PC version because the touch screen works better than the mouse. I also love the food machine you can get for 12 diamonds. It's pricey but we'll worth the purchase. I kinda wish the pace of customers was a little bit slower so I had more time to prepare the food. I do wish however that I didn't need so many gems to upgrade every little thing. Or if I do need gems then maybe they could be easier to get instead of only getting 5 every time you level up. So, decrease the pace of customers and make the gems easier to get",
        "This game is an amazing way to pass the time! I love all the upgrades and different levels, especially the events. The game gets more challenging as you go along, and the events I previoisly mentioned make it just that much better. My only complaint is how hard it is to get the special currency of the game, being diamonds. Other than that, it is a great game overall and I am looking forward to future updates.",
        "I loved the game but after the first restaurant you need gems to upgrade things regularly and they do not come around often after the first restaurant. All the achievements are money based. Money is easy to come by and I have only won on the casino once and all the fun is lost grinding to make money to spend on the slot machine to try and get gems. I'm on the second restaurant and I'm bored of waiting for gems to upgrade now.",
        "It would be nice for updated casino with new slot machine games and also some new restaurants.  Last one was quite sometime ago?  Are you still actively developing the game or you called it quits like some other games I had to uninstall because there was nothing left to do in them.  Just curious....."

        "Most intrusive ads ever. The game is great. Fun way to kill time. But the ads are horrible. It will sometimes open my browser to some sketchy foreign site, which then opens pop-ups saying that my phone has viruses and I need to download this so and so app. Really ruins the game.",
        "Horrible! Fills phone with malware/adware. Ads stop your game play and send you to a sketchy phone cleaning site. I can't tell you how the actual game play was because literally every 5 seconds an ad will interupt you. Don't bother downloading this advertisement disguised as a game.",
        "It's fun I love it but only Trump, Kim, and Vald are special? Why not Hillary or Obama. I would also like other funny costumes no holds bar let me play as people from sausage party too! This needs co-op and much more costumes. Don't limit it to just that I wan a ol Bernie sausage :D my favorite game ever. More than my kitty cannon games!",
        "Once an ad on an app tries to trick me with a fake virus warning I'm done with. Even without the fake virus warnings the ads do not give you a chance to say yes or no, you are taken straight to a site the Google Store. I find this extremely rude",
        "This game is fantastic! The style, sounds, and music set a fun and cartoon-ish tone, and the gameplay adds a sense of tension and suspense as the player does not know what the next obstacle will be and cannot stop the character completely as the sausage continues to walk onward. This game is fun to play and hilarious (specifically the sausage's dying cries/animations), and the obstacles aren't predictable, but the pace is initially too slow, making the game a bit boring at the beginning. I would like to see a game mode that increases the pace right from the start, like a speed mode, and new dying cries/animations and obstacles in future updates. However, as the game is right now, it's a lot of fun. Definitely recommend."

        "I gave it three stars because not too far along in the game, it turns into a \"pay to win\" game. Some boards simply don't give you enough moves, so you're forced to use coins to continue or retry and lose a life.  I don't mind hard games, but I detest micro transactions being needed so soon into it.. I'm at level 24, that's it, and already the board doesn't even give you a fighting chance to beat it without using coins.",
        "Its a nice game! But it just takes forever to open a new level. Sometimes your on one for days. That's just to long. That's why I pay farm inland. You can play for hours with out bring stopped no lives. . I want a game that's fun and relaxing. No hard or extra hard ones. I really like cleaning and fixing thing. Be nice if you could do more area and less puzzle.",
        "I love decorating the rooms but I am having to pay too much to get enough points to do it.   I also don't like that each room requires more points to do the tasks than the previous room.  I have changed my rating to low because you end up spending too much of your own money to get powerful to get your stars to complete the tasks.  They also lose your purchases.  I bought a desk chair yesterday and now it is missing and the task is gone too.  Rip off.",
        "This game is awesome. But the stars, please increase the amount of star not just 1. Make it 2 for the Hard Level. And lastly, it's hard to download new rooms when it always appear the Technical Error. Better if you do not require to download it and the user can open it without connecting to internet. However, the game is great for relaxing. Keep up the good work!",
        "Never thought it would be this addictive! At first i thought \"Oh, its THAT game that always pops up in advertisements.\" but after deciding to give it a try, i am hooked!   I introduced homescapes to my mom as well and downloaded it for her and she finds it adorable and fun as well. We both take time to chill out and have fun with the puzzles occasionally when we are together.   I cant find a single flaw or critique for this game, its amazing :)",
        "Veeery enjoyable game! I feel like it's advertised too much, but it's definitely worth playing. Especially if you love games like Bejeweled!  Some of the levels are unnecessarily difficult to get by. You have to either get lucky, or be some type of strategic genius to pass them within a good time frame. That's slightly disappounting. Its too much of an encouragement to use money."

I have never seen this problem before in any other game, no reason this game would be different. About the game? Well, I'll tell when this problem is gone üòÖ",
        "This is a great game. I have played it for over 2 years now and it's still my favorite game. Advice to newbies, take your time. Stay in one age and build up your resources before moving on. You can play in multiple worlds, join guilds, make friends and they have great quests to do if you choose to.",
        "It is  great game, for ages 10 and up even 9 is okay. It is cool that we are building a town from scratch, like from the prehistoric time, and building our way up. Not like other game that start you off with big present day buildings. It doesn't cost a lot to do things like building and removing things, some object are free, they give the right amount of money and you can always win some more diamonds. In other games you would have to pay to remove object and buildings are ridiculously expensive.  It is hard to make money in other games and to make diamonds. I personally at night put my hunters too make things that take 8 hours and in the day things that take 5 to 15 minutes but sometimes 1hour. It is a very good game, it is almost as a real life city town, empire.",

Another ad. Very shameless",

Im prob gonna try to get more ppl to play with me too lol. There could be more variety in the blocks, and there should be like different modes, just an idea",
        "Its cool and all but needs some extra features.  Maybe a way to store 1 brick for later or some level advancement.  Maybe challenges or a power up system. The game is addictive but its very basic. with no real progression path,  other than beating your own high score, it becomes boring.  Still,  thanks for what it is.",
        "What they show on the preview and what it gives you in game don't even match. They make it look like it so easy. You cannot rotate the pieces. The pieces they give are so random, and most games you can barely get past a couple of turns before you can't place anymore and you lose.",

        "I really really hated it. Just freezes my phone n have to buy a new one  for 4954  dollars. Its just stupid n u really need more tutorial. Make this game have more tutorials n stop this freezing part for a better game n have  a 5 star rating from me n not a 2 star rating. Do u want a 2 star rating or 5 star rating? Just to be clear, DO NOT DOWNLOAD THIS GAME IF U ARE DUMB. Tksüòíüòíüòí",
        "This is very deceiving. It looks like it's Tetris, but it's not. The pieces don't come down like the pictures show. I hate apps like this who deceive people to believe its a certain game when it's not just to get people to download. Will never download a game from this developer again."

        "A giant mess of people who pay a ton of money to prey on anyone with impunity. Absolutely no rules regarding who or how often you can attack someone significantly lower in level. Even if you are stupid enough to pour money into this garbage, you will get your butt handed to you by someone else.",
        "Has alot to keep you busy. For that i give 5 stars. Minus 1 star because certain features in the game cannot be unlocked unless you spend money. To me thats a recipe for a slow death. For i will soon be leaving guns of glory in a blaze of glory based on that alone.",
        "You guys really need to do some balancing. It's ridiculous that a level 22 guy can just annihilate me when I'm level 10. Its pretty blatant that you're trying to force us to pay to play. You should make it to where you can only attack X levels below you and the further down you go, the less loot/xp you get, if you attack even or higher you get bonus loot/xp. Good game but needs rebalancing asap or your game will slowly die.",
        "This is for the makers of this game you need to introduce rules so that players who either work for the makers or spend 100's to become strong very quickly... cannot destroy the enjoyment of the game for those of us who would like to grow in the game and play the game properly to become strong through perseverance and hard work... the cash rich players are ruining this game for everyone...",
        "Need some updates like 2 simultaneously upgrade option. Less but more extensive research. Lengthy process is boring. I know by spending money u can get rid of it but money making shouldn't be always a concern.",
        "Game is absolutely nothing like the commercial on you tube. Kingdom #152 never wins in the INN at the mystical raffle. If you have ever played an MMO game on a cell phone app you'll know exactly what to do. Spend money to advance. Great for killing time."

Also on YT thanks for...   !!!! 2 SUBSCRIBERS!!!!  I know its not alot but I am rlly happy and I'm thankfully to who subscribed to me on YT :)  My name was galaxy DJ but now..  Its AngelPlayz I haven't even uploaded any videos yet üòÇüòÇ but thanks for the support!  I might be making new videos about roleplays bloxburg builds and games to enturtain u guys to not be bored!!   I LIKE TACCCCOOOOSSSSSSSSS.....  üççüççüçç .. This is so long lol...   Sorry how this is so long üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ Well yeah that's all I got to say..!!?  Cya peace GUYSüççüçç",
        "Well, I admit, I'm addicted to this. The levels are SO FUN, and also quite challenging. Sometimes,yes, I rage, but it wouldn't be fun if it was too easy.The animation is sophisticated, the music is AMAZING (my two favorite songs are Clutterfunk and Can't Let Go) and they give you a TON of levels for a free trial. I LOVE THIS GAME!!!! Thank you Robtop!!! üôåüòéüòç",
        "The whole game is very amazing. Listening to the soundtracks can make you get motivated on playing the certain level until you pass it. The game can sometimes make you rage a little, and the colors can be little bit to neon and flashy for you. The whole point that I think about this game is that it tries to make it very challenging. The colors are beautiful in my opinion. The ads can me sometimes annoying, but you can turn on the airplane more so that they won't annoy you too much. Keep up the great work, RobTobGames!   C√∏okie",
        "It's a real cool game, I do recommend playing this game because not is it only fun bit addictive as well. There are loads of levels so you never get Bored but warning ‚ö† the levels do get harder as u go further on. But yeah I do recommend playing this game it's super fun, super addictive and i would rate it a 4 star.",
        "So rage inducing! But i am a comete noob at your amazing creations. When o first downloaded it 3 yrs ago i hated it a deleyed after failing the first level before getting halfway. Some how though my abillity for rage cam control itself and yea. So in a way you made a rage game that helped my rage. Huh. Anyways great game might buy full version. Only if i can become a good player though",

        "Hey miniclip.. good morning.. i am from india.. i was playing 8 ball pool dubai match. I was just about to win when i hit my solid ball and then last black ball was left but the ball goes in opponents hand said that you didn't hit your ball.. what was that? Can you please stop all these hacks and all for other users. There is no fair gameplay between each other.. please do some favourable to all users.  Hope you will take quick action in this manner Thanks.. Apoorv",
        "First of all It's joyful game few notes need to address it:    1_last 3 weeks is suddenly stopped without farther notification.. And I was about to uninstall it..     2_one of the question was you can play with other users offline. This is not correct!...     3_ need to add \"Edit and changing names\"     4_Game rated with 5 star.. Than you all üé±",
        "Likes- 1) The game is pretty addictive.  2) Graphics is good.  3) Variations are cool.  4) Game controls are awesome.  5) You need skills and timing. 6) Stats keeps you update how you       are performing.  7) You make friends while playing.  Dislikes -  1) It's also a game of money so....  2) When you win too many games       you get tougher opponents.  3) Despite having good Internet      connection the game disrupts in      between by disconnecting it.  4) The game starts controlling you        in winning or losing.",
        "I realize y'all gotta get paid but why make the playing experience for those of us that don't pay cash money.  Not allowing a player to select a pocket when shooting the 8 ball and allowing your opponent to shoot and win. I guess I'm pretty good because nobody has been able to get rid of me playing pool. Instead I seem to get strange lock ups or no response from game. I always seem to lose 100s of thousands. It's a pretty good app and I've sent many people to download your app.",
        "Best pool graphic wise but the game is not fair what so ever. Game is Controlled you don't decide if you win the game does. Your win percentage and rank don't mean squat. Cues length and force controlled to games advantage even when reloaded. I had 6,991,000 and my win percentage was 61.3 and lost 1 million 5x in a row. How do I have a 61.3% chance of winning and lose so easily by these 40-50% players like nothing. If you don't actually buy stuff with actual money on app game will treat you poorly.",
        "8 ball i have been playing it for sometime now and I spend alot of money on the specials.. great specials.. but I noticed whenever I buy coins I don't win any games until those coins are over and I'm only winning recently 2 games maximum in a row and normally my win streak used to be 7 and above... I don't know why this is happening but it sucks because it's putting me off the game.. it's like 8 ball is making sure I'm losing hence the rate 3"

        "The game is good, but the multiplayer needs to be fixed.  It hangs on load and results in the player losing money or gems with no recourse.  It randomly drops ships, and when one player immediatlely gets the best ship and the other player doesn't receive any ship until 10 rounds later, it is impossible to catch up.  Fix the multiplayer, then you get your 5 stars.",
        "Definitely not worth it. Was fun at first, but after the updated quests, the game took a serious nosedive in quality. Now you HAVE to beat the opponent in order to get anything, otherwise you're out 1000 gold. Before, you would get something just for playing. The new PvP just sucks.",

        "Its a great competitive game with similar and different stuff compared to PUBG, and even does some things a bit better. But please nerf the vehicles hitbox radius and how many people can get into a car all at once. I've been killed 6 times now by someone or some people using only a vehicle and running other people over. Nerf the vehicles and I'll rate 5 star.",
        "The game really ok. I love the feature where you can talk to your team online. However, since I've updated my ROS, it became super loggy and now I can't even open it to play. I tried to re-install the game but still, it won't open anymore. What happen? Please fix it immediately.",
        "I have crashed a ridiculous amount of times in the new update. And guess what? If it doesn't crash, it lags so bad that it makes it impossible to play. Its a good game when it works, which isn't very often for me. And now when I was riding in a three wheeler and a enemy started driving and I crashed, then when I got back I was out of the three wheeler and in the middle of a fire fight and died",
        "Before the update its just normal lag that I used to. But after the update, its getting more lag + delay when try to look around. What I mean is you know when your finger is not sync with character movement (uhh how do I explain this). Sorry my english is terrible. Idk if you get what Im trying to explain. Like 0.5 second delay when look left look right look up look down. Its very hard to aim at enemy and looting and stuff. All of this happen after the Feb 28 update.",
        "This is F ridiculous!! I experienced more glitches after the update!! The updates didnt do anything much about the glitches!! People will just appear from nowhere!! I played this game everyday and every single day i always experience glitches!! The sound is also confusing even if you try to listen.You hear sounds that coming from the back but the enemy is actually in front.",
        "No complaints about the game, i liked it. It's just that i lost my account today and i dont know what's the cause. last time i played it i closed the game when i finished a match by pressing the home button and left it there for a few hours. when i open the game again my account was lost. i forgot to bind my account to any social media because i thought i already binded it by sharing to facebook. is there any way you guys can help me ?"

        "This is a very good game and I highly recommend it but there are two small changes I would make.    1) I would make it so that you can move the object in your village i.e. trees, rocks as there are afew seasonal decoration that I would like to keep but they are getting in the way of my village.    2) I would also make it so that you can put more then 1 builder on a construction to cut down its time or add more builder.    But other then them 2 changes I think it's a great game and I've had lots of fun with it.",
        "The heroes should be for all players from the lower level. They can make their own choice to choose the hero or switch them. If you provide the better or strongest hero for the strong one, it means the stronger is still the better and even the best. The weaker will have no choice,  but accepting the unfair attack from those strong ones. Please think about it again. Be fair for all players. Otherwise, the stronger or the best ones are still the stronger and the best ones. How about the weak ones? Do they have a chance to use their strategy? It's the strategy game, not for only the big or strong players. Thanks!!...",
        "Soo gooood so nice ossum game i loved to play clash of clans graphics are good controls are good i have a small request if we have got any bonus in war or multiple battles it goes directly into the clan castle and when we want withdraw it give hole treasure comes out.

So if U keep a device ,in which we can type how much  amount of  treasure we want to withdraw. It will be great honor if U put it in next update.",
        "It is a good family game and it is a way to play with lots of friends and even make some new friends in your clan. It does not take lots of money to complete they game it only takes skill and dedication. I have played this game for years and have had many different accounts on it, but you just have to dedicate your self to one on those accounts to get a good high level account",
        "What happened to the game I used to enjoy? Now everything is turning into a spam fest. Strategy has been consistently removed from the game with each update. BH still has a bunch of AI issues. For the first time ever (as a max 11 and misc other accounts) I can honestly say uninstalling has crossed my mind."

I used to love it then and I still do now, but I've recently noticed pretty annoying glitch that's driving me away from the game. For some reason, a few hours after I download the game, it doesn't allow me to enter the game anymore. When I open the game,  it will run smoothly up until the point when it reaches the loading screen and simply returns me to the home screen. I try to reopen it and the same thing happens. I'm not really sure why this happens, but until this glitch is gone, I will be forced to stay away from the game entirely as the only way to fix this glitch is to download the game again which is quite time consuming.",

Could you please add the opinion to change the cash to English pounds (¬£) and the chance to open more lockers and better chances on getting rare items. And tell us which cities we could find certain items we need to have in storage to complete missions.",
        "Have a problem, mutt's semi legal store thing won't work. The black screen to show the result thing shows up top left corner, but it's just stuck there. And the rest of the screen shows the normal background for mutt's semi legal store, and I pretty much can't do anything when this happens. I have to reset the game, and each time I try to \"show results\" in mutt's semi legal store, same thing happens. Please fix this",
        "What is wrong with the newest update? I can't acquire my item from the switch shop. Every time I click on get item, the black screen goes to the top left of the screen. And I can see the normal background picture. When that happens I have to close the game and reset. I've tried to get the item 20 times and it does that every time.",
        "Was a great game til the update. Now I have to open it twice for my energy to update and for the money in the pawn shop to change. Also when I bargain with clients now it's alway a negative profit compared to before. More annoying then anything",
        "My main issue with this game is the fact that a mission is requiring me to renovate a building but in order to do that I need to download an additional package which WILL NOT download. Rendering the mission unattainable and the game broken by default. Would this issue be resolved then there would be no need for such a low star rating and I would gladly rate it better.",
        "I enjoy playing this game. Currently I have two major problems with it.  1. I wish I could change orientation based on how my phone is tilted.  2. I tried to have Mutt trade something really expensive and now it freezes every time I attempt to open the trade."

        "I really like playing the game, it's fun with all the different character mechanics, but after the last update there has been a huge increase in ads that take me away from the game and open up play store or chrome. It does this in the middle of a round, so obviously it screws up my gameplay. Makes me consider paying for no ads, but also makes me want to delete.",
        "Addicting and a good time killer, but there are a lot of ads, and every time I downloaded it, it gave my phone a virus. If you have a new and protected phone, get the game, but if you have an old phone, do not get this game. IT WILL GIVE YOUR PHONE A VIRUS AND YOU CAN LOSE EVERYTHING ON IT!!!!!!!!",
        "I would give all 5 stars if the game would work. I played it yesterday on two different devices with no issues and today it is just not responsive. DO NOT DL THIS GAME. TOO MANY SPAM ADS SAYING MY SYSTEM HAS A VIRUS ALONG WITH ADS SAYING I WON A GIFT CARD.....JUST HAVE TO REGISTER ONLINE ETC... DO NOT D.L",
        "An unbelievable amount of ads in an otherwise fun game.   Ads after every match and spam ads trying to open my web browser multiple times mid match, somtimes when I'm preparing my shot which completely ruins it. Such a shame the devs chose to ruin their own game because of greed. Sadly this is more common than not nowadays.",
        "I WANT to like this game. It's fun. The problem is the ads (I'm fine with ads. It's a free game) but mid game it randomly opens ads. I'm talking the kind that take you to a whole new window and tell you your phone is infected and won't let you go back without closing that tab. It screws up your shots and it's just NOT ok. Please fix this mess and I'll redownload and give the game a better review. Ads are one thing but when they make the game unplayable, I have to delete the game.",
        "It's an amazing concept and idea that is very entertaining. The bad thing is that the ads interrupt the game so constantly that it messes up your shots and your online games too.  If that can be fixed so they appear after a match not in the middle of one that redirects you to a page full of ads and false notifications, then it will be a very awesome experience."

        "Everything costs money. You'll be playing then run out of grenades. That'll be 30g. Don't have that? Well enjoy losing until you figure out a way to win. Love this game though. Made a purchase right off for a gun. Then I saw how much grinding is involved for the upgrades. The jump between a level 2 and 3 upgrade? Then the outfits, 2nd and 3rd weapons. Man. Sorry no thank you. This shooter however is very fun but the paywall is so well thought out I am not prepared to drop that kind of money. Learned my lesson losing 1k to Megopolis.",
        "I love the game. the game play itself is very self explanatory, quick and very good fps however, they have scammed me. I spent 12.99 on gbucks, the purchase was confirmed, and right after they asked me if i had liked to submit another card number for another purchase. I recall having credentials on a different prepaid visa card in my notes, so I go look, unfortunately I didn't have the CVS code for it. I go back to the game, it had reloaded but I didn't get my gbucks. I was a little confused as the purchase had been confirmed, and the money was taken off my card. I tried contacting them 3 separate times about it but obviously they aren't vigilant of their customers and don't take them as a priority. I recommend playing the game but avoid spending money on it. If I could get some help and get a refund on my card, or the gbucks I originally paid for, I will give it 5 stars, as I would like to.",
        "I love this game so much. I have been looking for a good shooting game for years and I never found one until I came across this. This is perfect. Me and my friend would spend hours on this game. I have been playing this for about 6 months now. It's perfect. I think the best thing about this game is how organized everything is. It is very self explanatory. I found everything and it was easy to do so. I also love how they update this game very often. Great game. I haven't had any problems with it. I can't wait for updates later on to come.",
        "Great game with a lot of potential.... There can be so many more additions to make this fps better. More grenade varieties? A spectator mode? Clan levels that allow more players to join when we reacher higher levels? Gun balancing changes? I feel like the Cerberus should be buffed. It is expensive, and the 3 shots at once doesn't allow for many attempts for kills. Adventure mode for more gunbucks? Death match option? Allowing us to pick the map? I understand the game is fairly new, so keep on adding changes and new improvements. Thanks for listening!",
        "Great game to play, fun and exciting. But not F2P friendly. P2W guns will always be better and it's near impossible to get end games gear for F2P. But still bearable for F2P. My advice would be maintain F2P take it as a grindy F2P games and don't spend any money. It seems this game had an issue that you might not get the item you paid for. You will be charged and not receiving the item and when you try to contact the support. Oh boy... No body will be replying. It seems it's a trend here where there take your money and kick you out.",
        "Game is really tooo gud, graphics also nice n smooth controls but u guys released only one game mode(Team death match), but in lot of fps games they provided free for all, bomb mode, Flag capture n many more modes.. If u guys also provide  like that then ur game gonna be top in fps games üòÄ n mainly  not much places only 3-4... try to add more places n increase the area Size for more fun n more Dodge , now game look like playing in a pocket u guys need to increase area."

        "Do NOT go for high level military research without searching monster hunting, and Do NOT go for T4 if you not going to spent thousands of dollars. Even if you don't mind to wait 200 days, you will not able to afford it (lvl 10 military Def, Atk, Health cost 100m gold each). DO NOT GO FOR HIGH MILITARY AND T4 WITHOUT FULLY UNDERSTANDING THE GAME.",
        "Ive been playing for the better part of a year, and this game started out great for a long while. But IGG not only panders and gives better deals to Chinese people, cheaper packs etc. But literally 99% of all mega guilds and players are Chinese or Vietnamese. If your not asain don't play this game  you'll end up like me playing forever just to quit because of the obvious discrimination IGG holds with its playerbase",
        "Not a good game for new players.  Was fun and  interesting at first but you qucikly realise that you are just food for high level players with no way to reach a defensible level.  High level players basically teleport in, raid everyone and teleport out.  They should lock servers to keep it balanced and give more guidance for new players. This game is  clearly weighted towards the people who have been playing it the longest. Dont waste your time",
        "Kingdom 249 is open before just 50 days back. And one guild have 2B might. Most of the guys have millions of might one of them got 700M might. How's this is possible. Kingdom 277 is opened before 15 days back but one guild K03 got more powerful. Top guys got 120M might in just 15 days. Does IGG employees playing this game. We are lover of this game please don't lose your credibility. This two kingdom which I observed only Chinese players are strong. How overall kingdom only Chinese players got higher might in less time.",
        "This game is fun but be prepared for the mother of all Pay2win games.  These folks at IGG are experts at crafting new and exciting ways at fleecing their customers of every cent they can.  You CANNOT compete if u dont pay and pay often.  Players here ...just regular people... dump hundreds of rl $$$ regularly.  You have been warned.",
        "The game is awesome and there is always something to do  so you're never stuck waiting around for powerups or new lives. Unlike other games it doesn't require microtransactions to get stronger, but they do help you quicker if you're interested in paying. I'm addicted and play every day."

        "I think it's a good game but sometimes the ball would go in but then it bounces out you should also add modes, one like there are walls all around and I like the game keep making these addictive games:D also all you guys stop with the adds just turn off your WiFi let them have some money after hard work on many game's like would you want to make a game and not get money and just get  ALL YOUR COMMENTS WITH ADDS! ohhh that would be soo annoying.",
        "I love the game it is so simple yet super fun. Just the only down side is that there are WAY to many ads. I stared playing a round and then an ad pops up.. Like really. At least put a 15 second ad up after the round is finished where you can choose to wat h and ad to continue after you have missed and your time is up. If that person skips the chance then put up and ad. Or just remove them. Thank you dev for the lovely game though ¬∂:",
        "Don't get me wrong this app is addicting and fun. The thing that ruins this app is ads. For a game were it is meant to be played in quick bursts and you aren't meant to succeed for long periods of time, i don't understand how you can put an ad after every attempt. Sure one per 3 to 5 games and the another 30 second ad, but at the rate they come this game isn't fun anymore. The craziest thing to me is that i can't find a way to invest a few cents into the app to perma-block the ads. Come on dev i know you can do better than this. I will adjust the rating when i am offered a solution. Until then this 4 to 5 star app has 1 to 2 star potential.",
        "Ya hate ads? Turn off wifi and play. Stupid phone/gaming noobs. Its a good game and dont hate on it for ads. The ads make the people who made the game MONEY. Give then a break. Let them have money while u watch something u might want. If u wanna turn it off, like i said, turn off wifi.",
        "It would be 5 stars if for one, the ball didn't just disappear more or less everytime it goes of the screen. And two, if the ball actually moved when i tap the screen rather than decide to just lay on the ground like a dead badger. As for reason three, there are waaaay to many ads. It asks me if i want to watch an ad to continue so then i press no and it still makes me watch an ad, that's just cheap. I understand they have to make money but this is a whole different story here. But  when it does decide to work and when i turn my wifi off, its pretty fun.",
        "Would pay for the game to remove ads. I get you can turn off WiFi/data but it shouldn't be necessary, and is unfair to the company itself. Please offer a paid ad-free version!"

        "One way to check how much products I have left is by touching the machine and thr corresponding product but sometimes the game will assume  that you are putting the product into production hence it will put the product into production whether you want it or not so it will waste production time. Sometimes the touch is too sensitive. Sometimes the touch is not sensitive enough which forces me to drag the product into the production slot up to 10 ten times just to start production. I know this feedback is not much but maybe an undo button will help. It makes the gameplay million times difference if you  put your players comfort a priority.",

Also it would be good if you added a edit program that allows you to get rid of everything on your farm except of the house and other things like that and then you can put it how you want it so basically decoration or designing your farm.",

What comes to music as I read in comments, I always play games without music so haven't listened to this game's. I play this game as a reward after working hard and I'm entirely satisfied. There have been no crashes so far. Lots of ads, though.",
        "I mean the game in itself is......alright  it could be a lot better.  I think the controls are rubbish and I understand it's meant to be \"skillfull\" but thats harder than skillfull, you can't even see where the circle is, this also adds to the game being bad. Having said all this you have also added rubbish music..... like you could have put something decent on. I get even more of an urge to uninstall the game every time I play it. Overall I definitely do NOT recommend this game. Game developers I hope you read this as it will probably help you to make the game better. I understand it would take a while but I don't care. If any of the game developers want to feedback on my feedback you are welcome to.Thank you.",

There is Room for Improvement in the Amount of Coins Obtained in Completing Tasks, as Well as Eliminating Repetitious Tasks Requiring More Moves.",
        "Addictive, colourful and charming. I love it because I've spent zero real money on it and am at over level 280! I only use my in game coins when I'm desperate and I'm fine only playing a few times a day to let lives regenerate. Some levels are so frustrating but that's why you save the coins!",
        "Addictive, waiting 30 mins for a life is a pain. Also some of the levels are redicilously hard, esp when u get a rubbish sequence, always happens on lemonade levels!  Reason for 3 stars is mostly because, when u have struggled to get the stars for a task, when u open it, it's all chat & u have to get more stars to complete the actual task, I think that's unfair, 3 stars for a phone call, then another 3 for the job?  And the safe task? No option not to do it & can only prevail of the gamers winnings if u spend real money to buy the coins you earned.",
        "Should make the money in higher value as it is very hard to accumulate.  Poor marks because it takes so much of your hard earned levels and drops you down the ranks if you don't solve immediately.  I was at ruby level and have so many points taken away now I am back to silver....uninstalling thanks for nothing.",
        "I really enjoy this game, its quite addictive but i find it very satisfying. The only problem with it is that once you get into higher levels (i'm at 300) you start needing tons of stars for small things and for instance to get rid of one stump takes like 8 stars. Anyway I like the game and am going to keep playing it.",
        "If I could give it 0 stars I would. There is no way to contact support and you can't restart the game. I got a bad download and now I'm stuck with it. My personal information should not be part of playing a match 3 game anyhow. Game crashes at least once a day and my controls only work about 60% of the time. Horrible experience! Playrix should be ashamed of their programming here."

I plat at least a few games every night and I feel like it give me a nice challenge and makes me really think about the moves I'm making.  Especially at the higher difficulty levels.  Overall a great chess app with no glitches and a good brain inside of it.  A must for a chess player with any real skill at the game.",
        "I really was worried it would be too easy or too tough. tho I am not a master, yet, I know my way around the board.  I realized it has been making me a spectacular player ..the computer does not just do the same dumb moves over and over its almost like its stalking me like prey around the board! ha great game!!!-!!",
        "I love this game and the best brain exerciser game ever in the history.  The cool 3d view makes the game as if I am playing on the real board, very good graphics. However, it doesn't show the list of killed chessman during game play the only drawback. I am expecting this upgradation and this will be the perfect Android chess.",
        "So far it's o.k. I like the fact that it is simply a chess game with no fancy sound effects or graphics. I see no real reason to have the higher difficulty levels locked out until they are beaten but they are. I got it to practice with. It is useful for that. It's not bad...Just a simple down to earth chess game",
        "The game has been drawn because the other player has no legal move and is not in check. If they can ot move then I win because they cannot move to a legal position. The computer ends the games too early because they cannot be bothered to chase you around the board. You cannot unlock the higher difficulty games because it just says draw.",
        "Not 100% sure how that works but the other person has their king and it's a stale mate and I have practically most of my pieces but to unlock harder levels I have to win. Does stalemate not count? I think its pretty stupid"

    "description" : "Chess in your AndroidChess is a board game for two players. It is played on a square board, made of 64 smaller squares, with eight squares on each side. Each player starts with sixteen pieces: eight pawns, two knights, two bishops, two rooks, one queen and one king. The goal of the game is for each player to try and checkmate the king of the opponent. Checkmate is a threat ('check') to the opposing king which no move can stop. It ends the game.During the game the two opponents take turns to move one of their pieces to a different square of the board. One player ('White') has pieces of a light color; the other player ('Black') has pieces of a dark color. There are rules about how pieces move, and about taking the opponent's pieces off the board.

It's very frustrating to me because I have hit the targeted first Star and had recently hit ALL THREE Stars showing normally that I completed the Goal. No dice. I hope someone fixes this bug soon. It's making me not want to play anymore and I love playing this with my kids.",

        "It stopped working on my One plus! Help! I was excited about the side games! *********************************** Excellent, addictive fun. I reached shield 135 (level 1154) and it doesn't level up any more. Gutted! Still a great game but so sad I can't progress any more. No reason why really! Incidentally, good for helping kids with Mathematics.",
        "Is this game for You? Do you enjoy spending most of the game watching ads? Do you enjoy games that make it impossible to play without spending real money? Do you enjoy being grabbed by the crotch so hard you change genders?  If you answered yes or no to any of these then no this game is not for you. It's nothing but a crappy game designed to rake in as much money as possible, rather than making something fun. Forced to watch 30 second ads after each round. Forced to use the currency you earn when you don't want too. Enemy power will suddenly jump up 10 fold making spells and goldimpossible to gain without watching an addition 30 second ad. Even if you win and get the key you are forced to watch a 30 sec ad to unlock as if you didn't get a key.",
        "Concept and gameplay is ok, but, like others have said, there are way too many ads. Also the special spells you can unlock are given to you at random. Have a aituation that drill would be great for? Too bad take explosion.",
        "Fun game but takes forever to get gold to upgrade. The cost to pay for the gems to buy so you can buy gold is really expensive. Not much dynamic to the game. Same stuff on each level just takes longer to bet enemies cause of higher HP.",
        "This game is really good.  The more you play the harder it gets but it is doable and you can watch ads to get you trough without paying.  I am around level 35 & haven't spent anything.  It is a hard to put down game.  The visuals are super satisfying,  especially when you get your little bombs kicking butt on the upper side of the enemy and they get faster and faster.  So satisfying!"

        "I used to play this game a long time ago with my brother. I thought since after all these years so many new updates have come, the game must feel different. But it's the same. I love the tune that plays as you play it. It's so nostalgic. My brother isn't anymore with me but playing this game makes me really very happy. It's just like I am back in those old days. Specially for me, as it has so many memories, this game is the absolute best.",
        "I have a problem with my account. My punk zombird was maxed out. Level 3. Then when I opened the game, my punk zombird was gone... I obtained that by waiting patiently and gathering 90 diamonds. I had to watch 3 15-30 sec long video for 2 diamonds each. After watching the 3 vids, I had to wait another 8 hours for it to be available again. It took me a month to obtain that bird and then all of a sudden it dissapears?! I obtained it again but I had to start all over again. I uninstalled this app because of that issue.",
        "The game is really addictive. but repeated zombie birds are generated and diamonds are getting wasted. Please change that. One bird one time please. One bird should be at max 3 level not another set. It's wasting my internet to watch video to get diamonds for collecting birds",
        "I personally loved this game. First off,  u cant jump for high periods of time cause u to run into the bombs. Secondly, whats sup with these prices? Thats ridiculous. You cant level up with prices that high and u have to buy üíé gems and coins just to get a level up... But tum... Very great game overall.",
        "I love this game cause it kills our time when were bored. Yep, we, my mom also is addicted to this game hahaha, shes always getting my phone and play this game whenever im sleeping. Love it, I recommend this game to everyoneüíñ you'll be definitely love this game. MobiGame you slaaaay hahaha",
        "I was confident to delete the app from my phone cos it says that the game will be saved on my fb acc. But only the highest score remained and the potion got back to 1. I was already at 56! Deym! Ayusin nyo buhay nyo! Sayang effort ko! Aba!"

        "Absolutely love all of the geometry dash games! Colors and graphics are awesome, game play is challenging but fun, and the music is perfect! Only thing I can complain about is that I wish all of the levels from these free versions were in the full version. I own the full version and would much prefer to be able to play these levels without ads and with all of the cool characters and colors I have unlocked. Other than that though, amazing work you guys, keep it up!",
        "Woah. WOAH. WWOOAAHH!!! Oh. Another Chllenging game but thhe only thing i like in it tha it has Dantdm's Old Intro at the press start! Wow. I am pro at Geometry Dash Games and another one oh yea and there is Sub Zero(MK) name there like i saw them quickly. And i would say for the creator: plz. Creator keep the good work! Ok!!! And make more Geometry Dash and can u make something more fun for more people to play with!!!",
        "Oh my god... This is the best geometry dash free game I have ever played,  and is almost more fun than the full version.  Robtop, you have regained full respect after what happened with meltdown. I'm just speechless, at the amount of work that was put into these three levels, going from the camera angles to the animations. This game is not like meltdown,  which is three short amateur levels, but with three long, harder levels. This game is like a preview to 2.2, and I know it's going to be good.  We'll done, Robtop! Keep up the great work!",
        "This just blows my mind... one thing I would like to see in the future is some rob-top made tutorials on how each editing items works in the game so other players can feel more comfortable making their own levels and not be intimidated by all the other fan made levels... I am one of those players who is intimidated by the other fan made levels... This could help young and creative minds to create their own levels their friends can enjoy. Thanks 10/10",
        "I love this game so much.  Some of the effects and colours added into the game make it so fun to play and watch. Its challenging and thats what makes it fun. Its not like one of those games that are so easy you finish it in an hour. This game takes time and effort. Also the backround music is pretty cool. Especially nock em with headphones. controls are very easy to use, just tap to jump and usually hold to use the vehicles, so easy! This game is perfect and absolutely fun. I would highly recommend downloading geometry dash subzero.",
        "Don't get me wrong, these new levels and songs are fun and addictive and all of the new stuff is awesome... but stop making new apps? Why not just update the original? It's kind of frustrating to have a paid version with stuff I've unlocked but have to deal with an unpaid version (aka, ads) and have to unlock skins and colors all over again because new apps keep being made."

        "Just way too many ads. Eventually you start having to watch an ad after every second other level. Its a free game, so I get it but the levels are so quick sometimes I'm watching more than I am playing. Fun game, though. Easy controls and great graphics and sound.",
        "Good fun and very addictive. I see people moaning about the adds üòß but what can you expect from a free game? You get an add pop up after about 5 puzzles and to be honest it is only for a few seconds....just close it if you don't want to see them.",
        "This game is outstanding. Love the graphics, simple to understand. Some appear quite easy and then you suddenly get a level that looks like it should be but has you scratching your head for AGES!!! Love it. I can live with the adverts, just wish i could put the phone down.",
        "Wonderful game, excellent graphics, its a free game, I solve 2 puzzles and a video ad plays I cant get over it, ad's are repeatedly played and I can't skip, but uninstalling cos too too much of ad's... after 2nd level game is very easy didn't find much interesting..",
        "Agree with other comments. Great graphics, fun to play, but the ADS!!!!!!!! eventually destroy the fun. Very repetitive after a while and challenge levels seem quite mixed. Have decided to delete the game mainly because of the ad onslaught. Other games have a much better ad/play psychology approach.",
        "Great time killer and keeps the brain ticking good fun. Ads are annoying but it's free and you can pay about ¬£1.50 to get rid of them if your that bothered ü§î"

        "During my free time, I like to spend time with my sister, she really enjoys this game so I enjoy it too. There are lots of games to choose from so you can never get bored. But I have one suggestion for the mobile version, please add parties, it is super hard to get on the popular games with her that she wants to play.",
        "Wow. What a waste of time and energy. Poorly made, nice idea but poorly done. Game doesnt work, on screen controls dont work on my tablet, bluetooth contoller joysticks work but no buttons work. No options for controller mapping. No real options for anything. My kid loves this game but i beleive it to be an unplayable piece of trash on my tablet. The only thing roblox accomplished was to frustrate and anger me. I do not recommend this game to anyone.",
        "I loved the game but seriously, you need to make the loading faster! I chose to play (for example: Fashion Famous) then I loaded it after 1 hour it doesn't still have loaded. I know tons of people want to play that but why so slow?? :&lt;",
        "LOVE IT!! But the controls for mobiles are... you know \"horrible\" and the screen are so glitchy and when I jumped or walked its a little late... and all of the famous games, I cant even play it... when I play it, it will load, it will let me play just for a second and then the screen will go freeze, and then BOOM! It will return to roblox home... hopefully the controls for mobiles can be fix and some other stuff that needs to be fix ‚âà) TY for this wonderful game and I love it!!‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• (BTW my profile is \"cutekittyloverMia25\") &gt;.&lt;",

        "Classic UNO with a couple of modern twists and turns. I have never spent any real money in a game and I don't ever plan to, but here you also don't really need to. I've won many tournaments and got really far in the game without buying anything. You get extra coins by winning and completing daily tasks, as well as watching ads. But you're not forced to watch them. It's not just about luck. You have to play smart to win, just like any other card game. I love it.",
        "Tokens take too long to refill. Level up gives a few coins, why not a token refill? Tournament champion gets 4 tokens. 7 tokens for a day? Cheapskates! When do you want us to play, every 5 days? So cheap in giving prizes, guessing you want us to buy eh? I'll give myself a few weeks playing this game and am out. No daily prize wheel, just a daily \"less than 20 coins\" reward. Sooooooo cheap!",
        "It's just ok.  Hard to see your entire hand at times and some of the rules are different than the actual UNO game itself. When I contacted this apps tech support, they sounded as if they could care less and said they will not be making any changes to the game.  So I play until they want me to buy credits then I stop.  When they give me more free credits I play again.  I like the game UNO, just not this one so much.  Why do I still play?  Hmmm, that's a good question.",
        "Greatest game ever~~¬§mean it.  The Updated game even better.  Need to be easier to play with Friends that you JUST made ~~maybe REPLAY!!!  üò¨ üò≤ üò† üòê üò≠  Friends where are you? Great for tablets.   I am UNO happy . Happy New years  .Oh don't terminate the game unless you just have to, I well try finding something other to do. Nothing Good ever lasts anyway.   Thanks for reading.  UNO POWER.",
        "Great game in the graphics department however, I agree with other consumers when they say the special abilities you can obtain by playing this game ruins it. Simple is best and this uno app is anything but. Sometimes when I log in, the tokens don't even recharge overnight and I have to wait a few more hours before I play three free rounds of uno before you have to pay for more tokens. Very hit and miss app.",
        "Okay, this is actually a decent game HOWEVER unless you buy your way through its almost impossible to win tournaments.  They shouldn't be putting people in the \"club\" and level 100+ with people who are like level 10 and not in this \"club\" it makes it almost impossible for them to win unless they're INSANELY lucky.  People with cheats can turn you from being at uno and winning, to being in last place in seconds and it honestly just kills the enjoyment of the game"

        "I've liked this game for years. Some adjustments needed: realistically if gas goes empty and you're still coasting or you're in the air you should be able to coast until the vehicle completely stops or lands before the game stops. You've had the nitros in now which is great. However, you still haven't fixed the previous issue. IF I CAN COAST OR NITRO BOOST MYSELF TO A GAS CAN THAT'S LOGICAL. However, you stop the game before the vehicle stops moving which is in a sense, removing logic, and the law of motion!",
        "The best racing game ever, I've played this game along time ago. the first version it has 4/5 cars it was so fuuun.That was 5 years ago now I want to play it again.I feel the nostalgia ooohh the good old days.Now I'm going to install the game.U guys change my life Thank u guys soo much guys. I hope my tears will help u guys. :)",
        "Great game, but I only have one issue which prevents me from giving 5 stars. This issue is that the hot rod doesn't go as fast as it should, I know this because I have grown up around hot rods and Rockabilly since birth. This is only a small problem for me, but it prevents me from enjoying the game as much as I'd like to. Please improve it.",
        "Maybe some new vehicles? Taxi. Limo. Tow truck. Hearse.... maybe some new stages too? Under water. Race track. Bridges. Derby. Graveyard.  I originally posted this way back in 2015 and yet you said you are constantly improving the game??? We try and give you the developer new ideas but it seems that no one bothers to read our comments? I guess it's just a lack of interest. Hopefully this time someone will read it............",
        "For this game to be so simple compared to todays games and grafics, I love it. I spend hours sometimes playing this.  Not to mention they keep upgrading and making it beter and better, keep it up fellas....i havent experienced any of the problems mentioned withthe updates others have but until then great game",
        "Best game ever. I play it all the time even at work but people look at me stupid because im trying to keep from dying and tilting my phone like a moron.. Please make my efforts not be in vain!"

        "Honestly i really enjoy the game thus far thank you for all the recent updates niantic... but there is one thing that has been bothering me and that is 1v1 with friends and trading... both features were shown in the original trailer... yet again i love the care your giving the game niantic i truly praise it but i would like to know whats happening with my 2 listed thoughts",
        "Simply just needs more events. I get why trading isnt available yet, which is to prevent RMT and if you have RMT that's just the end of the game. But hope you could soon add the 1v1 battle feature, BUT WITH MOVES LIKE THE REAL GAME NOT JUST TAP AND USING THE SPECIAL SKILL.   Overall love it tho, been walking 2km/day for 2 whole weeks now. (Lookin for a gastly xD)",
        "Please have more legendary raid events with gen 1 and 2 Pokemon for new and returning players who want to collect everything. With regards to using GPS and joystick cheats you guys actually benefit by getting more players from rural areas or dangerous areas playing and spending money. Besides you still have to do all the hard work minus the walking so it technically isn't that unfair to others especially since everyone is level 40 these days with legendary Pokemon. The game is already balanced just needs more events. Please consider a premium service to pay for where we can use a joystick in game. We can pay monthly or something so everyone benefits.",
        "I love this game! Been just playing on my wife's account. Just recently decided to make my own, and it will not let me get past choosing my first Pokemon. They all spawn in the same spot and it quickly shows error 11 or whatever and won't even register me moving. I've tried everything to toubleshoot and fix it. Nothings working. Really sucks because I love playing. Can someone fix this or tell me what's going on?",
        "thx for niantic that always listened our sugesttion, but i wish we can trade or battling with other player around the world by staying at poke center or else... - and btw you should update the new gym and new pokestop... since when i was on holiday in Indonesia theres not so much pokestop and gym around :( even there are many landmark in there - another suggestion plz maked some item that can be used to summon legendary/raid battle in location that we want, so its much easier  for the communities to do raid battle in specific location",
        "Can you developers make it so people can trade pokemon and other things like items? Itll make the game sooooo much better if teamates could trade items and Pokemon. People did it with cards, atleast to trade Pokemon. My bf and i play along with his friend David and when one of them need something that i got and visa versa, we should be able to trade. If you guys can make it happen, ill give this 5 stars instead of 4."

        "Excellent fun and a fantastic way to introduce a new audience to some wonderful classical music as well as very talented contempory composers. My one gripe is that recently players have been given multiple oportunities to get 3 crowns or very high scores with ad powered resources. I feel this takes a lot of the challenge from the game. Anyone can get 3 crowns in 4 or 5 goes where us old guard of the game did if in 1 or 2 Still an awesome game though and well worth the download anytime.",
        "This game can fit almost ANY personality type, keeping you entertained for hours!  Don't worry about getting low scores, because the game starts out slow and gets faster, so you'll always be prepared for faster tiles.  There are challenges where you challenge other people in the world!  I never want to give up on this game, its really addicting!",
        "I enjoy this game a lot and always loved how it challenged me. It was also fun when me and my friends would fight to see who's better but I dislike the update where they added boosters, it doesn't seem fair and for me it feel like it loses the title for being relaxing. I don't think that adding those futures was a great idea in my opinion and I really miss the old version a lot.",
        "This game is honestly a great time-killer and even has it's challenging parts, but from what I've noticed as you get to the higher tier songs they just get slower and slower and are just flat with barely any challenge. I expected more of a challenge with a higher level but now this game is getting horribly boring.",
        "I'm in love with this game. It's challenging, you don't have to listen to the music to follow the tiles, and it gives you the feeling to be better. I have a suggestion for a new song you can buy for diamonds. Can you add any song from the My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic TV show? Thanks.",
        "there seems to be a malfunction with sound. I've played several songs and each one has parts where there isn't any music. I'm not sure if this is a bug or just something wrong with my phone. other than that, though, this app is really entertaining."

        "This game is great, building is easy enough with the help of the system, and visiting other maps is a great feature. however for free players who just want to build, you would find that the available blocks are extremely limited. Other blocks cost 50gems (per block) and ~200 gems are already 4$.. Customizing avatar and villagers can go up to 10k gems since individual items are minimum 1k gems. Great game, if you're willing to go broke",
        "Its the best game I have ever played. The things you can build are amazing and it's great that you can build your own to. The controls and graphics are unbelievably amazing. Great animal sounds to, they actually sound exactly the same as a real animal. Its also great that you can have villager's and your own pets. Only problem is the packs you have to use diamonds and if I don't have enough then I have pay for the diamonds and I'm just a kid and my mom says no so please make the packs and the things in them cheaper. But other than that, this game is so AWESOME. üòÉ",
        "Well,This Game Is Kinda Good.Im Gonna Rate It For 5 Stars In The First Place But It Changed My Mind After That. The Graphics Is Good,The Controls Are Good Too And Everything is really good. BUT THE ONLY PROBLEM it is very LAGGY. Maybe Next Time When You Make An Another Update,Make some improvemnts of not being laggy. PLS.",
        "This game is a dream come true!!!!! Firstly the controls are phenomenal, graphics are astonishing and techniquely... everything in this game is the best. Minecraft is already becoming stupid because of the high payments as they are the most creative crafting game. Well guess what? This is even more creative. Minecraft is just dumb. Art is good everything is good about minecraft but what gives for the price. While this app is the best and freee!!!",
        "Great game but I have been trying to figure out how to chat. before any recent updates when the graphics were different I somehow figured out to chat with someone, but now I can't remember! plz plz PLZ tell me how to chat, and if u removed the ability to chat can u add it in again?",
        "Graphics are great. Controls are great. Variety is great but too expensive. Gameplay is awefully boring. As in, It's too easy, and you must pay for everything so you have no freedom. Also, there is no threat on you whatsoever. YOU can't kill animals or herd them and there's nothing to explore. All you do is build stuff your assigned to build. (Sorry)"

        "It's a really fun and addictive game with one major flaw. After you start getting to the harder levels, you might as well quit and find a new game unless you only want to play one or two rounds an hour or pay to play. Every level costs coins to play and if you fail a level you are out pretty much your whole hourly allotment of coins. Winning a round doesn't make up for even one loss either. Love the game,  but really annoyed that I can't actually play it consistently enough to truly enjoy it.",
        "Love it and it really made  my brain thinking like do I want to risk lose money on wild card or go ahead to pick card from deck. When I won love that dog jump over three stars. I try to recalled did dog jump over two or one star. Maybe not. But still love it. Keep it coming",
        "The game is so much fun and great game play and graphics, etc. But it has one fatal flaw. When you get to higher levels, it becomes way too expensive. I paid for extra credits twice but then realized how worthless it is. Sad because I'd be willing to pay for packages for bonuses but it's way too expensive to have to keep paying for rounds just to play.",
        "Like it but costs too much to play. Can only play a short time before I run out of points. To bad because great graphics.",
        "The only thing I do not like about Grand Harvest Solitaire is not being able to earn more coins to play longer. Games cost 2000 coins to play and you don't win much more than 2000 so you're always relying on harvests for coin & unable to play until you build your coins back up by harvesting every hour..."

Obviously I like other games but this is a whole different story. I just wanted to say please make it so u can join lower levels friends? I can't join my sister and were only five levels apart.",
        "Absolutely great game ,but you made some far too powerful guns too accessible early in the game, so I went down two trophies after I ran into a bunch of wallet warriors. And for God's sakes put a more powerful gun at the end of the campaign, I worked my ass off and it wasn't worth it. Other than that large rant, I love it so much and play it every day. Make exp,gold and diamond easier to obtain though.",
        "I LOVE this game My only complaint is in campaign mode it's said more worlds coming soon for YEARS!!! If they're not going to add a world eny time soon  they should at least change the coming soon part. But overall this is a good game and it seems like Cubic Games really care about what the consumers think.",
        "This used to be really cool. If you want to be strong buy gem weapons. It is too hard too earn coins or.gems. Also your opponents must be with same armor or level. I once fought a guy with the minigun shotgun and diamond armor and before I rekt everyone with the demoman but now it sucks",
        "This game is so good! I have played this game when it was in its early stages, and it was pretty good. Now it has gotten even better than before, with lots of multiplayer game options and lots of weapons and gadgets to choose from. There is one problem, which is when I got this game about a month or two ago, the prices to upgrade guns were pretty low for coins but ok for gems, but now they are ok for coins and WAY TO MUCH for gems, so I ask of you developers to please decrease the amount of gems it takes to upgrade gem bought guns.",
        "This game is the best I have ever played on a phone tons of maps, game modes, hundreds of guns, different tools, gear, and lots of skins. There is just so many things you can do. I also like it because it is a challenge something I would play. That's why I rated this game 5 stars."

But it should really save to the cloud because I was on LVL 38 or something, I had everything, then I had to move to a new tablet and all of my game progress *poof* vanished!! Also, everything's a BIT expensive... Other than that, It's a really good game! Well done Outfit7 üòÑ‚ù§",
        "Everything players have asked for is added. At a ridiculous price.  But if people are paying that's on them.   HOWEVER you shouldn't have to buy the adult /baby formula more than once. If you bought it you should be allowed to switch back and forth as you wish.    It's a really zen pass time  game :) also cute and interactive.",
        "This would totally be worth 5 stars if it weren't for the ADS. I get it's a free game, but its one thing to put an ad on the top or side of the screen. It's one thing to optionally watch ads for coins and prizes. But its another thing when full screen videos pop-up, pausing your game and wasting your time. I was honestly thinking about giving this 3 stars just b/c of how annoying that is alone.",

        "This is an awesome game that gives you daily and weekly quest's and offers treasure chests. Now they have new levels to play and collect like blazing sands, and the spooky summit level for Halloween. Then they added the new global challenges.This game just keeps growing, not like many of the other games that just stays the same..you will be amazed. Now they added Global challenges, with new head gear...like I said this game keeps growing...it runs so smooth and the graphics are awesome. If you haven't tried it. Do it. If you have come back and be amazed at the changes.",
        "It's my favorite app. I love it a lot. My only issue is that it doesn't quite accurately update my stats especially my highest score without using a 'save me,' longest run, most coins & gems. I would really like the developers to look into that but otherwise it's a brilliant game.",
        "Thx for updating Frozen Shadows. Blazing Sands still needs work. Too much water, not enough Sand. Needs a \"slide,\" I recommend sand surfing. The canyons also get boring. The variations between it and the other levels don't compare, especially for the gem cost to play it. Still, fun and relaxing, and stays fun. 4/5.",
        "Nice, good, adventure game.but some times your team irritating who one completed thirteen level they will easily get diamond  your giving master challenge ( now the challenge Chinese New year )who one complete your giving thirty diamond only.this offer will useful only for entry level gamers. Most of players finished fourteen level so they no need diamonds.so think about genius players.",
        "I love all the graphics it's a bit like the        piano tiles it test's your fast skills but except it is temple run 2 love it. Except for the controls though cause sometimes if i turn it to right it goes to left and sometimes it bumps into the tree same to the left you need to fix the controls more.",
        "Brilliant game play with nice updates. However, certain things can be improved. For example, the gem powered power up is not clear. I am not sure whether the power up works only for one time use or for entire one run. Kindly, help to enlight users on this part."

        "What really drew me into this game was the the Pac-Man promotion, I love a good crossover and I can say with total certainty that I wouldn't be playing it if I couldn't play as Pac-Man, he's such a good inclusion. It's a super addictive game, setting it aside to do something else is quite difficult, hours go be seamlessly when playing it. The graphics as well are beautiful, very vibrant and colourful.   I have a few minor gripes with the game though, it crashed on me and when I restarted the game I had briefly lost all my content, that gave me a minor scare. The game is heavily geared towards microtransactions as well, unless you're prepared to pay money, get ready for a very, very long grind trying to get the stuff you want. Having said all that I absolutely love the game, very glad I downloaded it.",
        "Game looks good and it's well design, but far too many gimmicks and interruption. Hardly ever can actually run. Plus some silly hanging in the air for no reason. Got bored in 5 m",
        "Sonic Dash has a plethora of characters to unlock and play as. Some require real money, but most of them can be unlocked with Red Star Rings, and all of the characters can be won through events. You can even get Classic Sonic and Green Hill Zone! And every once in a while, they'll add some characters from different franchises to run as for a limited time, and if you unlock them, you'll be able to play as them forever.",

        "Awesome game I had ever played in my life... although I'm 20 just..üòâüòâ I just loved the game.today 21/02/2018 I installed it on my phone.within 1 hr I played 100+ times. Till now my highest score is 74 & I'm in challenge 25. Really loved this game very much. I recommend this game to my each & every friend...(even my enemy also...üòÇüòÇ Just kidding) I wished that I will cross 1000+ score on future.  Loved this game. Lots of Love to this game & ketchapp. üòòüòòüòò‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è",
        "A simple, addictive yet hard and raging game. I love how you can customize your spheres and roads--and to turn off the ads just turn off your WiFi or data. Honestly, after 250 it gets a little impossible to play lol. Keep up the good work, Ketchapp!",
        "Enjoyed, On a overall basis i really enjoyed the game. And i also finished all the 100 challenges within a time of 5 days, as the game is really captivating i kept on continuously playing it. But now i am kind of bored from it as there's nothing to do after i have completed the 100 challenges. If there is an addition of another 100 more challenges that would make the game more fun to play and i would enjoy it thoroughly. Also i am not sure how will i earn the other spehers and roads without any challenges, so if anyone can help me how in figuring that out it would be really nice. At the end the game is really good. Cheers to the creaters.",
        "Fun little time killer. My only problem is that daily rewards fail to show up most days. It could be a problem on my end, but I don't know, and it's a pretty small issue so I don't really care.",
        "Another great game from ketchapp. A very unique idea, executed well and with nice graphics. It is simple yet difficult, a good combination. I gave it 4 stars however, as sometimes the game takes a while to respond to my touch, and often doesn't respond at all. My phone is quite slow though, so I'm willing to give the game the benefit of the doubt.",
        "I've noticed that when I get higher in the challenges the ones involving lane switching glitch out and never let me complete it. I have counted and I don't think it is possible for me to have counted incorrectly 20+ times repeatedly. Also now whenever I boot up the game it has the beginner tutorial pop-up telling you what to do which is annoying."

I don't get it cause I thought all my games save on Google or facebook all my other games are were there left off so please tell me I didnt waste all that money to start from the begining. I made this comment like 5 days ago I emailed provider of game waited 2 days then called Google only for them to tell me I need to get in touch with the game provider. Then I sent another email with purchases I did and my email and my phone number and nobody still has got back to me or commented on my review. So what do I do now my patience is running out. I even called the number that Google has provided for me for the provider and all I get is a voicemail which I cannot leave a voicemail."

The new update of the map is so radical that it feels like an entirely different map, with all the pathways and corners. The uniqueness of the original brewery map is that it is small, and relatively open, so that combat is focussed and fun. There is more time fighting others than moving around trying to find enemy players. The new update just ruins that uniqueness, making it feel like the Bureau or Legacy map. I am okay with the new brewery map being a new addition, but please make it \"Brewery 2\" and bring back the original Brewery.",

I suppose it is quite addictive but I lost interest after a few goes. It wasn't my cup of tea so to speak. I hope this review was helpful and remember to give it a big thumbs up!!!

        "I like this game. I purchased it because it deserves, also I want to remove ads. 3,50 ‚Ç¨ and ads are not removed completely. I'm disappointed, expecially for the \"restore purchase\" button that not works. Despite this I think that as a game is fun but monotonous in the long run, defect of 90% of apps of this kind. I hope developers will add something with updates that are not other challenges that ofter go to luck (and waiting time should e removed also). Sometimes there are some bugs but irrilevant for gameplay. The development house has made other interesting apps too. Sorry for errors, is not my first language.",

        "This is a very fun game. It got me hooked for hours. However, there are still some things that need improvement. For example, when walking sideways along fences you can get over them. This is an issue as once i did this and fell into the water not being able to get back on. Also, the spikes do not seem to have an effect on the shark so they are useless. I do believe that the developer needs to continue to work on this game and introduce new items and uses for them.",
        "It's honestly a pretty good game, it's fun, even though there's no real end goal and a lack of side quests. Although many improvements can be made to the game, the worst part is the ads, it's really bad, and it's insulting as a player that they try to milk this much out of us. You have constant random ads that take over your game at any moment. 5 ads per chest you craft to unlock each slot, ads when you switch to the map, floating treasure chests that require ads to open, even more pointless ads at every crafting bench, and the list goes on. I would gladly even pay to play an ad free version, but this is just ridiculous.",

        "You cannot walk on wooden fundations and you cannot walk on single or double foundations. Please fix this it is very annoying and im not able to play the game, because when the shark attacks in a corner you cannot hit him with your spear. This is the same for the zombie. I built a little house on the raft and it spawned behind the wall of my house. Please fix it",

        "I really like this game, kind of wish the progression system was a bit quicker though, other than that, the tight controls, open world and variety of creatures you can eat make it a solid game. The special sharks look really cool, and I even considered buying one until I saw the 50$ price tag.   On a side note, what's the difference between this app and the Hungry Shark World?",
        "Winnings suck. Instructions are very vague. Way too many ads. Feel like in order to play you have to pay in order accomplish levels and continue story campaign. Sorry guys but I bet my criticism has been said over and over again. Result is boredom. Too many other games to waste my time playing. Need to fix these if you wish to keep this game on the market people!!!!",
        "It's a really fun game, but sometimes you'll play a video to revive your shark and the video will play but you don't get another life afterwards. It's hard to believe that it is a WiFi problem because if it was an ad wouldn't be able to load at all. Also, I have paused the game before and come back minutes later and the game had kicked me out and not saved any coins/gems gained from that round. They clearly have a few bugs to work out.",
        "i would rate 5 stars... but.. something with the cloud save broke, i used to have the megalodon, without any cheats.. but now i have the mako. could you fix this somehow? And do i email the support team? Im not good with all the emailing stuff.",
        "I thought it was SUPER DUPER AMAZING. Keep that game like this and don't change it. But whenever I would eat like a lot, then I don't get bigger and it said the more you eat the more bigger you get. So I think you should make that better. If u wouldn't have done that then I would be impressed by the game.",
        "Amazing game. I completed this game in 48 minutes Hahaha! Because I used luckypatcher :) I downloaded the luckypatcher in Googlechrome But it can harm your Device..... And the last shark is Moby dick His baby is as big as Megalodon."

        "Very enjoyable game, quite addictive and jumping back into a new game is quick. Couple of gripes, there seems to be some slow down or framrate dipping after an ad has shown and the option to remove ads isn't working. Sort this out and it will get another 2 stars",
        "Smooth control. Awesome idea . Not Much more I can say about it.(First Review). Now, my first thoughts about this game was that it was very good but as I have updated the game it has just been very slow and overturns when you tap. It also randomly takes you to the play store without tapping on an ad.",
        "Ads pop up during gameplay where your fingers contact so it stops game play ... other than that it's good but I've had enough. Fk you chilly:-p uninstalling",
        "The game was awesome and I loved it. But the latest update ruined it with ADS. They put the banner exactly where you mostly tap with the fingers to change direction, the game got laggy which it was not before and has started getting way too many pop ups. Uninstalling. *Sigh*",
        "A lot of frame rate issues. Lost many runs because controls become unresponsive while gameplay continued. Ads are incredible intrusive. That said, it can be really fun if they cleaned up the coding on this simple game."

        "Its way to hard to win and and the stats do nothing.  You have to be perfect and even then they fly by.  Still LOVE this game.  Just takes away the fun when you get left in the dust and you play the same lvl a million times hoping maybe one time you will be perfect.",
        "Awesome game!  Earning money is easy especially with online play and watching ads.  ONLY downfall is earning gold can be a pain,  seem like the only way to get gold is by beating a boss, buying gold with real cash and levelling up which can take some time.  Other then that it's a very addictive game if you love BMX that is.  Folloq me on instagram @evans_customz",
        "Very good game but I wish there was a better way of getting gold without having to pay out of your hard working money. Since when did games start asking for cash? I would pay to buy the game but buying gold is stupid as hell.. either way very good game",
        "Game is very addicting but after a little while of playing you can't hit jump or land! Maybe just me? Also, I don't want to pay for upgrades. Should be merit based on how well you race.",
        "Stats are meaningless. I was getting beat consistently by a bike with lesser stats. My bike speed was rated at 16 and the other bike was 10 and I got no separation whatsoever. The stats are misleading and only serve to get you to spend real money."

        "It's awesome very addictive, my game likes to freeze or glitch sometimes and I crash or die but it's a free game so not overly concerned about it. Overall great game when they game out with the sequel it addressed the main problem with this one mainly no other maps and you have to pay to get the female character",
        "This is  a extremely exciting game to play. It reminds me of the game PITFALL from ATARII. All though I like the graphics and the obstacles, I wish you could save your progress.",
        "I think this  game is so interesting  that I play it all day , and somtimes  it tell you that you  should  never ever  steal any thing  from a dangerous  place where nobody  is there, it is really  difficult.  Good luck  and be  safe",
        "It's a great game to spend time playing on but I would like the controls to change, their to annoying when I jump I die and am like WOAH... I JUMPED, THOUGH!!! otherwise. Great game.",
        "It's a bordom filler but that's about it. Is kind of boring it's self but I like it. It's a pretty cool game. Good job on the graphics tho. The animations are really nice. The gameplay functions are really simple. I give it a good solid meh",
        "I love temple run  its a fun game it's a good idea I always play it,  I usually hate games like subway surfers I thought it would be like that too much,but I'm glad I tried it it was awesome the one thing I would complain about is you shouldn't  be stealing an idol and toward the 300,000 score I start to get very dizzy the controls are nice I just don't like the tilting for coins it's very distracting"

        "This game is have potential, don't ruined it because of money. I have never been watching so many ads In my life just to get some 2 stars parts. Instead of being creative and making cool machines, this game is turning to - either pay to win or watch alot of ads to win. What's the point of \"playing\" in this game?",
        "I think this app is great! But there is a slight problem with selling items. When I repeatedly sell items, sometimes if, for example, I was selling an item for 6831 coins, then it would subtract 6831 from the total amount of coins I have and then add back in 6831 so I'd end up with just the same amount of coins I was at! Could you please fix this small bug? It would make this app even better!",
        "Developers, please read.  First, this is a fun game and I enjoy its play style. It's reminiscent of TV shows like Battles Bots and game series' like Bot Arena.   Second, I would like to suggest giving players the ability to add, delete, and move weapon, utility, and wheel anchors. In the same way players can currently add enhancements to parts and chassis's and move around stickers.   Third, It would be appreciated if Quick Play Super Boxes replaced Regular Boxes after all shipment slots are full. It would provide a greater incentive to keep playing Quick Play beyond just Winning Streak Crown Rewards.  I'm offering these suggestions because I really enjoy this game and would like to see it become a more fulfilling and personalized experience.  Thank you,",
        "I absolutely love this game. I spend a lot of time on it! It's fairly balanced between players who play for free and those who purchase gems to give their bots better stats. You can easily rank up without paying a dime. I did for so long, until I kept hoarding pieces and didn't want to sell. I began to use gems instead of coins.",
        "Fun strategy game, just wish it was easier to understand upgrades and easier to get a decent vehicle. Sometimes you have to wait for boxes other times you can watch ads to get thru them with no rhyme or reason as far as I can tell. The variety or maybe the lack of variety in boxes is pretty annoying. Sometimes you get the exact same part multiple times or with slight variations, which can drag out trying to get a decent upgrade on things.",
        "Game it self is great and a ton of fun.   But, the system for showing ads is so annoying.  It's not just your normal video ad no, they make you watch 3 different ads and a min of 16 or 11 sec each.  After you have watched the minimum time, you have to hit next and repeat again"

        "I love the game, the crafting system is awesome, the gameplay is great. However, there are some points that I suggest  1. Nerf the Damned, also the Lepers, they are strong for beginners. Club or Cart Thills can't beat them easily 2. Make another way to find leek seeds 3. Lepers can detect you sneaking to them, and they spawn out of nowhere. I don't know if it is a bug to me or not. 4. Cooking meat uses too much wood.  I look forward for more updates. It's a great game to be honest.  Edit: I love the events, especially the cart one.",
        "Honestly it's a great game and lots of fun but that energy mechanic needs to change. I know you can walk but it's still such a strange thing to gate your players out of playing.  Maybe if you could always travel at the same speed but if you didn't spend energy you could be attacked randomly while you travel. Or if energy was used to speed up crafting. I dunno but it's the only thing holding me back from a perfect score.",
        "This game is awesome but here are the things like really want in the next game. 1. I need to disconnect with Google play to delete my old saved progress full of mistakes. Please add this feature. 2. Zombies are too hard to beat . Please decrease some of their capabilities. 3. There must be an increase in chest slots . 4. Please decrease the quantity of wood logs to cook. Otherwise all of our hardworking to gather logs while be replaced by only a few meats and others. 6. Please add another source of getting seeds. They are too hard to get.",
        "Very good idea but lack of some stuff like improvements. Right now the demolition system not work and we cannot move the walls or floors. The energy should be more sustainable and will be good if the trees on the base and some stuff randomly spawn. I will drop the game for now and on the future i Will give another shoot",
        "The game is ok.. i love the idea.. but in all RPG and similar games you can accuire your items from when you died from your body in that zone.. also its good when you enter the inventory to pause the game.. when entering a zone the game should give some time before reseting the material and monsters if the player re-enters the same zone.. These are the most critical points so far i have encountered.. please take these in consideration.. thank you",
        "It does look good but I get the feeling it's a \"stolen\" idea of the game Last Day on Earth because it's almost the exact same thing with a few minor differences. But I'm ok with that. I have both games and play them both. But this game has very sketchy game play, even with the graphics on low on my device, it's all fidgity while collecting in the resource areas. This game, though I think has better overall visuals that LDON, it still has a ways to go to get to a better game play as LEON. Keep up the good work!"

It started out as a really awesome game until I found out that the developers only care about getting your money and after they get your money they don't give you what you paid for and you spend a week fighting with the developers to get what you purchase. After you get to a certain level in the game you can either buy the gems so you can continue your progress or stay stuck where you are. I am uninstalling this game and I suggest that you don't waste your time with this game.",

Theres so many Heroic dragons and legendaries that are level 30+, and now they all use the right \"hits\" everytime, and when you don't have any \"good\" dragons, it is very hard to win. Previous battle system was rly good, when those dragons used random hits.",

        "It is a good concept, but it is literally begging for money. I didn't log into Facebook so I have to pay like 20 gems just to be able to get my level limit for dragons +5. To get a metal habitat, I need to pay gems. To expand, as I am not logged into Facebook and so cannot pay by gold, I have to pay gems. It is so frustrating."

Maybe a later update brings a fix..................",

        "Everything was great except in the beginning it kept saying I didn't find any mice but I found them twice on the first one.. but then I restarted it and it worked fine.. until it kept freezing and I had to restart my tablet.. after doing that like 5 times it worked great thru out the whole game.. I kinda felt like it was a lot shorter then the other games. But other then that I had fun playing it and I'm super excited for other to come out so hurryyy!!!!!!! Lol",
        "This is just like the other game you guys made, the one with the doctor in the hospital, down to the exact same thing of \"play the first couple of levels for free but if you like you pay\" I bet this one is for the same price. On a side note, the story is different but the game play is the same, go have a look if you want. I will say this is a good game and I take nothing away from the hard work you have done. Good looking graphics, good smooth game play. A game you can get into and do try the other games of this developers you may like it as well. Over all a good game I just do not think it is worth $15. But best of luck guys.",
        "Great game  I don't normally spend the Ching on many games. . This has a different take of an old favorite.  But none of the challenge levels are working on my game.  Once it's over, nothing happens.  I don't get credit for work achieved and I have to restart with same result. A glitch. Waiting for update",
        "I absolutely love this game. However I had to order a new phone due to mine being replaced for insurance purposes and I was logged into my Facebook and lost all my progress and the app is NOW wanting me to repay. I don't wanna have to pay another 9.99. If there's anyway I can get my game back.",
        "Sometimes the game did responding to my tap. And what makes me very angry is i had to redo challenge several times because of the game stop (no \"level complete\" appear), lily parker just stand still, nothing happens...all i can do is tap setting button and choose : back to map or rerty the level.. i counter this issue on challenge mission only, not yet in normal mission.. And it's very annoying",
        "Love these games. I've purchased them all from different sagas. I'm just encountering a  problem with this one in particular. At the end of every challenge it glitches and I can't get my rewards. It stays on the challenge and I have to go back to the menu and play again. Pretty frustrating. Hoping it can be resolved."

Giving you a 5-star rating would be nothing but a joke because the sensitivity is incredibly without a dope the pain in my butt. You have to have so many abilities in order to do anything in this game and it's not worth my time to spend trying to figure it out. Good luck but I am going to use my Minecraft because it actually functions properly. Nice attempt at trying to copy the original.",

But please add stuff like levers, iron doors, animals, Redstone, Buttons, iron trapdoors, texture packs, adventure mode,  Redstone torch's, Hoppers, Ripeters, dimensions like the Nether and The End, And other stuff from the game, \"Minecraft\". Also, add skin packs and make it like people can see there hand, and add mobs like dogs, cats, birds, rabbits, and foxes. Dogs, Man's best friend. Cats, Always cute. Birds, Watch them well you build. Rabbits, See them jump. Foxes. See one on an adventure. Please Also pay for Minecraft if you want it for stuff like Creepers. Also, add farm animals like chickens, sheep, cows, And other stuff like that. But plz do it. Also, add all paintings, pictures from Minecraft, and caves. I will Enjoy the game more if you do. Bye!",

    "description" : "Ever wanted to be Mayor? Ever wanted to run a town, develop the land, and see a metropolis grow? Well, look no further than Merge Town!, the newest title from Gram Games. The concept of the game is simple - you have a plot of land, and it‚Äôs your job to turn it into a town. Every so often, you‚Äôll be gifted with a house.

        "Overall the game is great. Gameplay is smooth but slow (hey, old ships), making the gameplay calming. Graphics are pleasing to the eyes, though it could still need improvements. Sounds are calming too.   You guys should change the image for the gold coins since it resembles a symbol in One Piece. And also the whale movement could be smoother and slower. You could add more creatures in the ocean in addition to the whale since its just blank at times.",
        "Very simple. Gives me a lot of nostalgia. Two things though, it seriously needs music maybe some Celtic tunes or shanties. And secondly it needs more stuff to do. When I first saw a whale I was excited about doing some whaling but nope. The whales do absolutely nothing. Maybe even some treasure hunting puzzles or something. Good game just needs a little more content.",
        "Good game however, once you've taken control of all the islands there is little else to keep you interested. I would look at adding more world's and making the trading a real economy by having the ability to buy items and sell them for a profit in different ports. Potentially even have your ports taken over again or mutiny so you need to recapture them.",
        "It's a really great game! I'm really looking forward to an update. I think it'd be REALLY helpful to be able to purchase an extra boat that just goes around and picks up boxes.. Having to turn around all the time gets tedious. Also an online pvp would be awesome. Maybe have the ability to make clans with your friends that can attack other clans. I'm looking forward to see what you guys do!",
        "This game is great overall and you have a great sense of progression as your ship gets bigger and faster. The problem is the controls themselves. I found it very hard( I noticed this when I reached HP or ship level 6 ) and sometimes close to impossible to fire at other ship even at point blank range. The game has a very hard time trying to focus on one ship and would often shoot at where the enemy was 3 seconds ago especially when there is more than 3 ships at once which often happens. I would recommend a fire button option to compliment the controls and the gameplay experience. As I said before, it is indeed a very amusing game and would be even more enjoyable with this added feature.",
        "Great game in all honesty I can actually see myself playing this game for weeks to months. Everything about it is perfect and I  love how it is not based on a story.   Note devs: for some reason after playing for 10 min strait my boat gets to the point where it can't hit a single shot so I have to restart the game."

        "Was an awesome game. There were bugs that were resolved. Now, it's pretty much assured that in order to keep playing, you have to buy keys in order to get the cars for the prestige cups. For the last four months I have gotten the same tier one and two cars over and over again. If you don't mind spending that much money, it's great. As for me, it just became a major turnoff.",
        "Really really addicted. Yes you know when your good. Yes you do.  Ok honest? Expand on the shop.  Tweaking the appearance and performance of the rides.  Everyone has their own way of saying, yes that's how I would if I really could.  You end up creating a bond or developing a relationship  with it.  Take it to the next level!  Gear ratios and n02 pushezes and grip are all good but let's envelop.  I know I would play more if I could truly express my kickass whip that represents  me that I have to drive!  You have a clean and immersive game. Less is more.  Thank you",
        "Customer support has won me over. They have literally provided the best resolution can think of for the game removing all my fusion parts. Hopefully I don't have many issues in the future but this one time moment has definitely filled me with confidence that in future, zynga will fairly sort things out.",
        "Everything about this game is totally incredible and great fun. Love it. However I am disappointed after the early Feb update that affected the performance of all of my cars. I've contacted support and they say the development team is working to bring us the best gaming experience.....Hopefully they can restore my cars to their previous performance sometime very soon, but it's been almost a month so far.",
        "Very cool game with good graphics but beware for this game is based around paying to play. The purchases aren't cheap either. If you're not careful you could find yourself spending hundreds yet still not getting what you need to beat the bosses. So if you're into forking up your hard earned cash by all means enjoy.",
        "I love this game! It's really addicting quick. Since it has an online feature, there is basically no end to how much fun you can have with it. I think it would be much better if you could add your own body upgrades. As in body kits, spoilers, etc. It would allow the players to have very personalized vehicles."

        "It is some much  fun  but i wish that there was girl characters and you can pick a girl or a boy when you first play not just being a boy because girls want to play it too not just boys and it's not fair that only there only boy characters are not girls not every mostly every game has unless it's a girl game but this is a girl and a boy game so I can't there be a girl character instead of just boys because I played it and there are no girls at all like why so I hope that you guys can change that please I would really like that",

Rest it's surely one of the best game of EA and undoubtedly for the football lovers..Keep updating... I would like it more if you improve the physics of the game like curving the ball etc....please make it....",
        "After the last update, vs attack mode has become more frustrating. Before update I could compete with teams with higher rating. Now I'm losing to teams lower than me. The camera angle at corners is terrible. How did you make it worse? Before update would have given it a five star rating, now three.",
        "Vs mod is so bad after update. I have ovr 99. After update i lost many games from some guys who have ovr 94-95 because u didn't give me as many great chances as u predict. Once i played against 98 ovr player. He had 2 great and 6 good chances, i had 6 good chances and 0 great. It isnt ok.",
        "Had been playing this game for past 5 years. Its probably the best game in playstore. I had gone through lots of new events, campaign. The new updates are getting even better and better.    The only problem is league tournament needs to be worked on. The tournment matches between two league must be a equalised in terms of their player and team rating. Sometimes leagues tournament are so hard..",
        "Hey fifa, it been like this even before the Toty event Almost 2 months, no adds, no stamina for me, this really unfair, all of my friends are getting adds stamina, TOTY, Carniball, and now Lunar year Those eventy went extremely terrible and useless to me with no stamina!!  Please help me and fix this, my app is up to date, and i even re unstall it a few times desperately trying ro get adds back! But it was no good üòîüòî",
        "My stamina is never getting increased for every 10 minutes... I never knew there was an option like that until my friend said to me... And the update, the quest possible thing that can ever happen to this game was that update, it takes around 10 seconds to open a pack and the gameplay, the worst of the worst is the gameplay, everything is messed up and in news i get message saying considering your reviews and feedback something is changed, now consider these feedback of the update and change, if it doesn't change, there is no use is continuing this game and uninstalling is the only option. I wish to get an reply for this problem! Thanks in advance!"

        "Awsome game. Completed all levels without any hack jzt waited  for hope   ( the lives ) evrbdy shld try this. Sry i gonna uninstall this app only bcoz i finished all levels. Each time when u invite me to rate this app i was thinking that i shall rate this 5 if i win the 75th level. Now iam satisfied.... Great timepass.. Nice tactics, waiting 4 more awsome funny levels. If anybody has any diffrnt opinion cntact me on telegram @chichu  this is my user name. Thnx 4 thiz awsome gift babe.",
        "The game is really interesting and entertaining. The graphics are smooth and and the controls are manageable.   The thing I disliked through my game play is that you don't get any clues what you have to do and/or how to defeat the new \"enemies\". While you understand what exactly you have to do, you've lost some lives. But that's not so important.  I will strongly recommend this game just because of its graphics, entertainment and due the fact, that this game is not pay-to-win game.",
        "I really liked this game. The levels are very challenging and this game is addictive and fun. The only issue is that there are only 5 short lives  that when our lives ran out, we have to wait 18-19 minutes long to have 5 lives again. Of course, there are many hard levels in the game that keeps us dying and think a way to pass the level. So if possible, please shorten the time, like 5-7 minutes only and let us really enjoy the game. It's more even challenging and thrilling if there are many lives. And this game will be really perfect for us. Thank you.",
        "Remember the old days when platformers taught you through trial and error how to interact with new game mechanics? If you don't like that, you'll hate this game. So much fun, so creative, and once you start to get down one of the new features, it ramps it up and keeps you learning creatively how to beat the level. I love this game, it's a fantastic platformer that will challenge you to learn as you go instead of giving you a tutorial every time something new comes up.",
        "Completed all but just couldn't get enough of it. Everyone should play Redball 4. It is D best android games I've ever played. Those who complained about the Game play and control has an abnormal thumb. Easy, Fun & Challenging but nothing impossible to get through. I just hope they make new levels.",
        "I love this game üòçüòç it is my favourite but.... I don't like The lives system . I have to wait for it . I know that there is a pro version but.. can you please give us one or 2 extra lives when we complete a level? I think it's a great ideaüòãüòã btw i loved it üòçüòçüòç ill give it 5 stars thenüòäüòä"

        "I get that ads should be used to support a free app.. But this game is unplayable due to every ad they insert. Literally after every action is another 30 sec ad. You can't even play the main game because they kill you with ads. Uninstalling.",
        "I really enjoy this game but there are too many ads and it crashes every now and then. Online play is kind of bad because it pairs you with ppl that dont ever play and if they do its every couple days until you can play your turn, which could be just to discard a card. I do absolutely like this game. I play actual card game still to this day. Great app just needs work. Will update more stars after updates start coming out.",
        "Would be nice if the game would stop glitching and making me lose coins. Edit: I was excited about the update but there's still glitches!! You pay a coin to use the extra card in your hand boost and the robots get to have 5 cards but you only get 2 or 3 or if you're lucky you'll get 4 cards in total in your hand.",
        "I love the game, the set up is great but if you want more people to actually play the you get rid of some of the ads. I completely understand that the ads are a key point but not it is annoying while your in a middle of a game and an ad pop up. Sorry but it makes me not want to play. I have never wrote a comment or rated a game for the simple fact that if I didn't like it I would just delete the app or game but I took my time to write this one because I really love this game and it brings back lots of childhood memories and I don't have to actually sit down and play with others",
        "So many ads they interfere with gameplay! What should be a quick turn becomes a 3 minute play. I don't ads, I support developers making money and even click on ads for bonuses, but this is ridiculous. The game is also laggy, which I suspect if from the ads trying to load. Expect game crashes as well - one occurs every gameplay for me."

        "Very fun game. Multiplayer is awsome! Please add private matches so i can play with friends.   Physics still need work to hold up to real world standard. Rocks dont follow thru on take outs in real life as they do in this game. Also (rules), a rock needs to make it all the way over the hogline in order to stay in play.  Thank you for making this game!",
        "Best curling game I've seen Enjoy the graphics, controls, love the 1 on 1 against international players and career game options. Seems consistent and easy to learn. Needs a few tweaks like... throws that don't make hog line or touch hogline must be taken out of play. Have seen the bug that others reported, sometimes rock after thrown disappears , some kind of glitch that happens occasionally.  Sometimes the sweepers don't react to my movement to sweep. Would love to see 8 stones instead of 6. If you love curling, this should satisfy",
        "Great game except for hackers. There is a hack that allows some to bump or change finish of a throw. Yoy can go from having 2 scoring to opponent having the score, changing after the rocks stopped. Developers have not replied ti report. Fine for some fun but don't waste your money in upgrades",
        "The physics of this game are terrible. It's fatal flaw is if you have a completely frozen rock, you physically can't remove it, but this game you can completely remove 3 rocks even if they are all frozen. Also the free guard rule is very loosley applied. This game clearly was not created by someone who has ever curled.",
        "Physics are not like real curling, rocks are dead in the house when hit, physically impossible doubles and triples, improper use of the free guard zone rules (if a rock is in the house, it is free to be removed...not in this game).  Connecting people across the globe is a cool idea but you frequently lose people and you win without finishing a game.  I've played for 35 years so I speak from experience.",
        "Full of cheaters Started to play and it was awesome. But it seems that some people created cheats and make your pins move from their places without even theirs touching them so that they win points. I will not play it until its updated and try again. Too bad."

Thank-you and keep up the awesome work.  *UPDATE* 17 FEB 2018.  Have started my friends and family trying to get Top Score. No one is really trying as they are all enjoying playing the app to care. Brought a tear to my eye. Once again, \"Thank-you\"  for a truly  wonderful game.",
        "Simple tile game with a nice learning curve. Easy enough to be able to relax while playing and challenging enough to not be boring.  Instant gratification for finishing levels, packs, and difficulty ratings.  There are 'rolling points' that I haven't figured out the use for yet. Coins to purchase hints and other stuff. The ball can have different 'skins' that you unlock as you complete grpups of packs.  TLDR?  I'm having fun. Maybe you can too.",
        "The graphics, controls, n the gameplay are ALL 5 by me. I was expecting this game to be boring but finally, i downloaded it n it was a BLAST! I could NEVER take my eyes off this game as its AMAZINGLY fun. I was not expecting it to be THAT fun, but it was!!! There is absouloutly NOTHING WRONG about this game. The only  thing that is wrong is when people say bad things about this game. But there are NO glitches, barely no adds n NO expectations! This game is absouloutly my MOST favourite  game OF ALL the others.üëç",

        "This game is awesome,  a great puzzle game. I only had it for about 3 weeks and already on pacgage 20 level 10 on expert. I  will have the game beat in a few days. Thanks for amazing game."

        "I  love this game but why does it take 30 minutes for a life to refill and also why does everyone who plays the game not receive ten lives only some of your players this needs to be fixed it's not fair I've been playing for years and only receive five lives at a time when others receive ten lives.I play other games and the lives refill every 7 to 15 minutes. Can you please make changes",
        "So far, I dig this game. Although, the individuality of it is scarce. I still play it and enjoy it. It's not identical to other games of this type, as the challenges are similar yet different. The scenario of the game is basic with the others. I have a variety when it comes to games, this one has similar sound affects to other games that I, personally, downloaded. (But they're also from the same makers.) This game is over all.... Good so far.. I would recommend, linked my account to this game and invited friends and family. (I only do so, if the game/app is worthy. I'm a picky bull!!!!) Overall, you'll have fun! Cute toys and  unique power ups, with a slightly (10%) twist.",
        "Definitely addicting. The levels are challenging, the tools are fun to figure out and the reward set up is not unattainable. The only other thing is they grew more wise  for the latest update, you can't change the time on your phone to add lives anymore! Probably better that way, one (read: I) should pace themselves when playing....",
        "This is by far the most fun I've  had with a game app! Its so cute and  colorful!  And each increase in difficulty  makes you want to keep coming back for the next challenge.  What also makes it awesome  is a no brainer,  its great for children and adults alike.  BIG THUMBS UP!",
        "Really enjoyed the game until I was entered in a two week tournament.  Now, the boards are incredibly difficult and I can no longer earn prizes on a regular basis. Of course, I suppose that's by design so I spend money. Which I won't do. I just want some \"bubblegum\" to past the time.  Now, it's making my blood pressure rise...  Also amazing how many 5 ‚≠ê ratings they get in one day without the user giving explanations on why. Seems suspicious...",
        "Not happy! I'm up to level 1521 and for some reason it's taken me back to level 1. What is going on? I've been playing for about a year and NOT happy I'm back to level 1 again. This has now happened to me 3 times where I have been at maximum levels into the legends arena and BOOM! All my levels are gone all my boosters  - which I have paid hundreds of dollars buying are gone. Support do not respond to my repeated requests to resolve this. Very disappointed I've been playing this for almost 2 years."

        "This game could use better and easier ways to earn money for opening the chests and scoring or pay outs after each prize or game. So you can get better equipment and achievements. Would help keep players more interested. My only dislikes so far. I most definitely enjoy the game and think it's pretty awesome!",
        "Best game period. Not just golf or sports game, but any game. Wouldn't change a thing. All ya all who say, oh they need to change this or that, and why do I have to play someone who's better than me? Well it's because you suck, and you have no hand eye coordination. Just shut up and dribb, uh I mean play. #1 game for a reason peeps. Love ya. Dueces. Peace biatches.",
        "It's cool but everyone seems to be fairly good so all matches come down to a shoot out. Meh. And in the shootouts your opponent can see ur shot if u go first. Meh. All kinds of perks for FB. I don't have FB. Meh. Have to spend $$ to get decent clubs and balls or play this 24/7 and I won't do either lol. Nice try tho playdemic. Cheers.",
        "Just downgraded from a 3.  I just played a game were the other  player hit the ball out of bounds and wasn't given a penalty, then hit a miracle shot from over 100 yards away to beat  me.  I immediately uninstalled after that.  Was a decent game but the devs need to make some major changes.",
        "The game has too many glitches. On top of that there are people who know how to cheat. For example they will aim right at the woods make sure that the ball hooks and then they will be further down the Fairway than you, it makes no sense! Also playdemic is the cheapest most greedy app creator ever. Many people have complained about cheating and they never returned any of your in-app purchases. It's fun to play, but not a fair game.",
        "I think most of the time i am actually playing against a computer and and not a real person . And the computer is programmed to make me lose so that i am forced  spend money on the game. The whole idea of gaming online is to have a friendly yet fair platfotn for people to enjoy and unwind.  So you based on the above very brief of the begining of the end fir companies such as yourselves... i would recommend the following simple advise free of charge.....  Safeguarding  the companies reputation is everything.  The future of gaming ,NOT INCLUDING casino/gambling type apps, will be based on trust and have a more family type target market, and thus should have different business models."

        "(REAL REVIEW! NOT A PAID REVIEWER) Really enjoying the game. It's a good time killer. Some levels are a lot of fun and actually require a little bit of skill. The only thing keeping me from giving it 5 stars is there are way too many ads. It will randomly make you watch a video to upgrade your ride or character, and/or to play a level. There's been a few times where I had enough tickets to play, and coins to upgrade my character the two points recommended, and I had to watch a video for all three. Three ads before you can even play a level is ridiculous. I understand that it's a big part of making money for the developers, but I've never had a free game with this many ads. Get rid of some of the ads and I'll gladly update my review to 5 stars.",

        "l was enjoying the game a lot and would have given it 5 stars. l spent a long time to get enough bricks to  build a level 7 home so dragons only needed 7 mins sleep.. NOW    only  the same 5 of my 30 dragons get out and this is making collecting bricks and healing power very slow. l have not seen all my green dragons and moon dragons( the hardest workers) for 2 days now. developers please help or l will stop playing. TY.",
        "I would love to give this game 5 stars but 99% of the ground I've uncovered is covered by \"treasure chests\" and there's no way to get rid of them or contact the game makers for help. I've completely run out of space and can't play anymore. The chests should disappear after 3 - 5 days if they're not opened.",
        "Love this game. Graphics are great and so much to do. Keeps me going for ages. Main concern and the reason I've not rated 5 star is the time it takes to get each token. When some levels take 7 and it takes half a day to fill up it's a major pain. Then you do a level that needs 4 and the next also 4 it takes the p*ss. Would be great to have a higher limit without getting charged or for them to fill up quicker. If this was done I would rate 5 star all round.",
        "2/5 stars because the only way to play the game is by paying! You can either pay to remove \"pay to open\" boxes or they don't go away taking up all your space! It takes 1 hr for your chalices (energy) to refill only 1 and you only get 7. Love the concept of the game and it is very unique but make it so that people can actually play. Get sponsors, play some ads, have the boxes disappear after a certain amount of time, ANYYHING! This is b*lls*it and not everyone has money to throw away on games. Fix it or I keep the rating low.",
        "Playing this game makes me lose track of time. Wish we could buy the dragon egg chests with game coins.  That would be greatly helpful. Please consider this. Also would be great to transfer items from other levels back to the camp, like eggs, flowers, etc. Plz have this feature.Thanks. Plus would help if there was a set button to hit to exit the game. I am finding it takes between a few to about 5 times to hit the back button on my tablet. Plz fix, would make things alot quicker.",
        "Buggy.  The game itself was pretty good but there are issues with the cloud save deleting peoples games + all their in-app purchases (like me). The support for the game is non-existent. They have one email address to send issues to, and it's been weeks, almost a month, since and there has been no response. So everything is gone and they can't be bothered to try and restore my account for a month.   In short, it was fun and addictive, but your game will delete itself eventually and the support staff doesn't care since they already have your money."

But when I'm connected to Wi-Fi there's too many ads just slapped into my face. Yes I understand that you'll get these ads but ketchapp seriously,will you give and ad while I'm playing the game??!! It's too much for me. But still I love the game so I just play it turning my Wi-Fi off in my mobile.",
        "Well before I say my review, I would like to clear out a few of the negative reviews. There are not very many ads at all, in fact I barely ever even get any. Second, the controls don't suck, they are just wobbly, but that is the point. Without the difficult turning, the game would be too easy. With that all said, this game is pretty fun.",
        "Nice game but became boring in just one day! 2 options of controls: Spin (Steering Wheel) and Tap. Tap option is easier than spin. You have to complete the damn missions but the coins are only available in Normal mode they aren't available in arena mode. For making easy highscore follow this!! 1. Switch your controls to tap mode. 2. Open Arena mode. 3. In the beginning take the U-turn. 4. Keep driving in the middle line i.e in between of lane 1 and lane 2. 5. Just keep driving on that small line dividing both lanes and you'll get your highscore until and unless you get tired, I've made it to 3,887.  Normal mode is quite harder than the Arena but it provides coins and you've to play it for getting your missions accomplished!  Thanks",

        "It's stupid. It's really boring after your first try! And, when you come to a turn, the car doesn't turn fast enough. When you turn before a turn, it turns too fast. This thing is hacked.",
        "Difficult to master, weave through the road and collect gems on your way. Simple and addicting. Ads get a little annoying and are placed in a bad way (bottom of the screen)."

        "Think about playing all day Ridiculously good graphics for a mobile game, excellent soundtrack that matches the intensity of each level, and never gets boring. The free version makes you restart from the beginning instead of checkpoints, but I don't even mind because it's still challenging and fun with each replay. I do wish I could play in a different mode for free though. This would be an awesome Zen game.",
        "The gameplay is unique and challenging and fun but this game feels like a demo as all the other game modes (PvP , co-op etc) are locked for free users. And you can't even use checkpoints without paying them( like SERIOUSLY?!) So once the game is over you have to start all over again if you are a free user. Apart from that this game definitely deserves a try from people looking for casual , relaxing yet challenging gameplay.",
        "Great game This is a wonderful game, with great gameplay, amazing aesthetics and highly addictive. Totally worth the $2 for the premium version. I do have one problem though: even though I am pretty decent at the game, Google Play won't give me any achievements even though I'm sure I have earned some. It won't even let me open achievements or leaderboard pages. Is anybody else having this issue?",
        "Smash Hit Smash hit is awesome because it has a lot of intensity in the game so I get to let my brain work a little.  It kinda let your brain decide if your should hit it or not. I also really like this game because the game is kinda hard so it challenges me a little bit. So who ever made this game I appreciate it. One more thing about Smash Hit is that it brings my family together because we take turns playing the game to let our brain think. Thank You!",
        "Spectacular Shockingly Good Game This game is addicting and amazing who thought breaking glass could be so fun. I mean somebody thought of something random when they made this. I I love it it is just so amazing. If only the person who thought of it made the game so that you didn't have to pay for some stuff like extra levels. Still if you're reading this and you're questioning if you should download this or not you definitely should.! üòâüòÄ‚ò∫",
        "I came across this app while I was browsing for more games. Looks very well designed and I've decided to make room for this app. The very first time I played this game my mind was literally blown. Awesome music, fantastic design/graphics and very creative gameplay. It gave me a very good first impression that within 30 minutes into the game I've upgraded to premium. The different game modes accomodate various type of players. The challenges are reasonable. Literally every aspect of this game is a success. The premium upgrade is worth every cent. Who need ads if you can give a very good first impression. A simple yet sophisticated game. Very well done indeed, a must for time killer!"

I have a straight the next person always has a higher hand. Seems suspicious. I know u can't win all the time but still. Also private tables where only friends/poker buddy's can join would be a definite plus to add to the game. As some of the randoms just f around and bet all in from the start.",

        "I've found it very disappointing when  other user's connection is bad and their counter time takes forever while they're not even active. IMO if it happens twice they should be kicked. No one likes slow poker, especially when the player isn't even playing.  Other than that everything else is pretty awesome.",
        "Had trouble restarting sit and go. Returning to lobby and reentering addressed problem. Pretty good app. Challenges are obviously based on bankroll making it more of a player's game instead of a winner's game because poker is not a winner's game. Long play on shootout can be annoying but why you buying in at 2k? You get to play daily if you like to play for free and can even complete challenges when you went bust.",

        "I'm 11 and i love it so much.I have some Ideas for a toca kitchen 3. You can be able to make sandwiches and soups or stews. And more ingredients, more people. And you could add mustard and mayonnaise. Wait Maybe you could make tacos and weird ones. These are just  suggestions but I would love to see some of these suggestions. You would call it Toca Kitchen 3, with a nice logo. I did like toca kitchen 1 & 2. It is fun to play and food, and when we mess up to see how the people eating the food react. Bye.",
        "Awesome! You Can choose your pick. I am only using 9 and I love this. It is really interesting what they like and what they dislike. Thanks for making this , Toca Boca! I'm sure 7 year olds would be giggling with laughter. Keep up the good work! Best regards, -Bella on MSP",
        "I'm giving a 5 star rating, not cuz I like this game but because I want you to make all your games free or at least the toca life:city or vacation. Please I always wanted that game because It looks really fun and it must be. You probably won't make them free but if you can, make toca life city free at least",
        "I want YOU to read this Toca Boca I love it! But I have to ask, Why is there bread if you can't make a sandwich? Also can you make there a way to make soup? I really like your games but I am only 10,how do you expect me to pay for the games. At make 5 free like this!",
        "I like how I can give the guests disgusting drinks and food a see and hear their really funny reaction! Once I gave the girl a drink that had water,and all the spices and all of that, and she was like, the funniest reaction!üòÜüòÜ I also like how  there are different cooking supplies and spices and utensils! Keep up the good work! And make sure to make more today games free! Because then everyone will love you!",
        "I LOVE this app! And I'm so glad it's free! Everyone is like 'it's the same thing over and over again' but they're not actually getting into this game. They're are tons of different options to choose from and like Toca Boca says cook it your way. I LOVE TOCA BOCA!!!"

The entire screen goes black after playing the game for 5-6 minutes. That's pretty irritating not to mention how much slower the phone gets as well. Didn't have these issues with the last update. Fix it please!",
        "I've been on Township since 2015 and I absolutely love it. Its the first game I play in the morning and the last one I play at night. This game has so much personality. From the characters to the animals, it is by far the best game that I've played so far. Keeps me busy for hours and I recently got my boyfriend hooked, keeps him as busy as it does myself. I don't have any complaints about it. Thank you GPG for coming up with a game so super fantastic. Kudos to the developers.",
        "This game needs the ability to gain more township cash. I have spent way too much real money to buy township cash and im not doing so again at this rate. Farmville isnt this bad and hard to expand.  You cant expand the barn without waiting on products by train or paying in township cash to expand. And that costs over a couple hundred township cash for each expansion. Getting a dollar or two here and there takes forever to collect. Plus the expansion makes small expansions so it doesnt help much.   If something dont change i may quit the game. I enjoy it and would like to continue but at this rate i dont see much point. I cant afford to pay more money to play.",
        "Fantastically animated time-killer, very detailed and interesting to watch when you actually do pay attention to the stuff that happens around a well designed town. The co-op portion of the gameplay is just enough social interaction that I like in games like this. It isn't forced. Nothing really is, and that is rare for games like this. Keep them coming, I'm enjoying them!",
        "The Best!  But not Great my suggestion is please add an option to chat your friends privately this is important!.  Also add an option to search anyone by their township name so we can easily adding them.. Last one add an option to change your profiles photo from our gallery if you can~ instead of using our Facebook photos or township original photos.. Please make it happen",
        "Great game very addictive, and I don't know if I just found the right Co-op or what but the team work on this game is amazing. I love my little town although, üòí you need to be able to expand faster! I have NO ROOM for any more buildings, and they want me to expand my population so I can add more buildings. Thats's kind of ridiculous. That's the only bad thing I have to say about this game."

        "The gameplay is of course billion perfect and also the graphics!!! If any 1 wanted to play any interesting game....THIS IS THE ANSWER: goat simulator!! But when I was in a house in the game, I found a hilarious thing ..... Doritos the chips, hahaha it was really funny! Also when I went to the supermarket in goat simulator I found lays, Doritos and Oreos..can u imagine??!!!?!?!? Then I hit a girl and a boy with a gas car but they didn't die??!!! and that's a little bit creepy and weird. If u r asking a question why goat simulator got all of those downloads the 500 million I will answer u, cuz it's perfect and no 1 can do a game better than this. The graphics and gameplay and costumes!!",

        "After only playing a few short but addicting levels, I am already having a blast! The game may not look spectacular on a technical level. But the gameplay is so freaking fun! And the controls aren't too complicated either. Recommended for everyone!",
        "It's a fun little game at first, but has many, many flaws. You have to link it to your Facebook account if you wanna play all maps. There are way too many ads, they force you to buy their bikes which are ridiculously overpriced and overpowered, so you can't play multiplayer because people who bought those bikes will always beat you. That's just ridiculous. Not to mention it's very buggy. Sometimes you're racing someone who's in a completely different track than you. It used to be fun, now it's just stupid.",
        "Been playing for a few years and absolutely love the game.  Got a new phone, Moto G5 Plus, and now there is a half second pause every time I hit the gas or break in every race.  Extremely annoying when you're racing friends.",
        "Bugs and Glitches... Multiplayer links are not being sent back and forth properly. Some games keep giving me desert level 1 and not showing any replays or ghost bikes are doing a different levels then the one I am suppose to be racing against. Please Fix!!!",

I've had this game on almost every device I've ever owned!!!   It's so addicting and fun I can not click off of it no matter how hard I try!!"

It does have a few adds (chunks of 5 seconds, not bad) and the classic 30 second option add to double coins won (which i do, over a certain price lol)  overfall fun and great game to play when bored",

Yes there are ads but the game is free and even the \"microtransactions\" are so minor and the currency so easily obtained in game I can easily overlook the ads. Some have called it a Mario clone but in a way aren't most platformers but unlike so many of them this is actually very creative and well done. Excellent job!!",

I love playing the game and have got very far through the levels but even tho I was signed in with Google account I lost my game progress after having to reset my phone. Am I missing something? Is there a way to get my progress back?",

Sorry, would prefer you not send messages to all my friends with my name tagged on it.",

The only thing I don't like about football strike is that when I get on sometimes it won't let me click the spinner. So it's like my phone froze. But my phone didn't freeze. It's just the app. So can you guys please fix this.",

Best move I ever made for an app! This game is just flat out addicting, fun and challenging.  I was pleasantly surprised about how much fun it is and that there is, most of the time, something new.  Chalkenign friends and new people always makes for a challenging and fun time waster. Even if I don't have the time to play, I still make time!! Haha",

I didn't get my prize and I'm really very upset. I have a screenshot of winning cup also.. I hope miniclip will help me. I'm expecting my prize from you. I really love this game.",

        "Whenever you die in the game you start completely over again. And after each game an advertisement plays. Wish there could a 5 second skip button like YouTube does, especially you guys advertise every time after you die/end a game.  The graphics are cool, love the neon colors. It's a game for all ages!!! My kids and my husband and I all play this game. It's very competitive!!! I swear my husband can't beat my score no one has lol",
        "It is soooooo addictive and also VERY awesome. The only problem is that because people go on the game on their phone's or tablets I find it hard to control I don't know if anyone else thinks so but that's my opinion. Pls no hate anyway, Peace out and the reason it is like slither.io is bc it is by the same company",
        "It's good but not what I would play on daily basis..... it's my opinion so don't get mad. The controls are OKAY and I think they add more stuff to the game, I don't have any ideas for it though. This game is great and in the people like it but for me I wouldn't play it all the time on a road trip. Keep up the good work though! üòÄüòÄüòÄ",
        "Great game can be addictive with no real goal but to eat others poop as me and my daughter call it and other worms to grow bigger. Top notch comical game EVER that you wont be able to stop. Only set back is that the game gets extremely extremelylaggy on addroid tablets and on the online game interface",
        "A very addictive game that's great fun! The only problem is with the controls. It seems to go too fast without even hitting the speed button (if you have played it you will know what I mean). IMO the speed function is uneccesary, take it out of the game and it's 5 stars all the way!",
        "Great game however I wish there was a way to avoid the button that makes you speed up suddenly.  This us partially because you use your fingers to maneuver it and your fingers can get in the way of your view of the screen. It could cause you to kind if lose control of your worm."

        "Since the last update, being able to double up on coins from hourly balloons is impossible.  Also watching videos for coins isn't working.  This game is great when everything works right.  However, it is getting frustrating not being able to view videos for coins.  I'm game ad breaks are still working, so what's the deal?  The # 1 thing that keeps me in a game is not having to spend real money.  I a star simply because of this.  Fix it please.",
        "In this game once you have all of the flips it gets really boring. Also there are way to many ad breaks. This game was really fun but now that it's newer it's boring. It lags to much and kicks me out. I give this 1 star",
        "No matter how hard I tried, I would end up crashing on my head.  Round would end, and it would ask if you wish too see an ad.  Expect that after every round. Even if you say no, it will do an ad break every 3 rounds.  I wanted to enjoy this game, but it was not challenging, and so many ads that I uninstalled it.",
        "Ads ads and more ads. And really pushy ads that you can't just close straight away too. You spend more time watching ads than playing the game, and honestly you can't advance in the game without watching ads for coins anyway, so it's basically an advertisement with a mini game in between. Scummy sell out app.",
        "This game is great but I would only rate it a five if there were less adds. Every game I play, as soon as I finished it said \"add break\". This is very annoying as the adds are up to 30 seconds long. Please get rid of them."

        "I've been playing for almost 4 years and CC used to be better before you could purchase top level heroes. IGG really sucked what little competitive nature was left in the game out with pay to win. If you want to spend money on a game and still be competitive, play Summoners War instead.",
        "Some people use this for a dating app or say innapropiate things and kids play this game obviously. But that isnt the games fault its the players fault. However i would like it if the creators would sensor all of that",
        "OMG This app is annoying in all ways... And on Certain hack things I play this for 30 seconds but still don't get a pass! Tell CoTops to give me my credits",
        "Very unfair. D'ont download it unless you want to spend a fortune. After four years of playing, the new op heroes available for cash, will crash your in a second. Be aware !!!",
        "Game is getting better with being fair. Free to play people can actually roll decent heroes after a while with persistence. IGG is still unbelievably money hungry for their newest released things - but I guess it's better to wait for everything or pay for it upfront. I chose option 1. Thank you IGG for making rolling a little more fair.",
        "Initially it was a wonderful game and addictive one. Now its been totally favouring just the pay to play members. Every month introducing new heroes and now is very difficult for the free to play players to cope up. The game now has become totally greedy for money."

McEarn points equals mc instead of like some of the others where it takes VEarn points to reach vc etc...Also, lnstaII 'TOYOCASH' App Enterr (TRDG) very reliable in paying you when you redeem to toyocash. You can choose assorted giftcards as payment or transfer to Walet for cash. Your choice. I love these guys thanks for addingsome fun to my day.",
        "I love the game play and graphics. But I payed for adidas female clothing and an aquarium previously on the game, and then when I restarted, they have gone. I spend ¬£3 on it in total and I actually spent more money on other things that didn't come back in the next game, but it's understandable because they were lifestyle points and you know it's currency not clothing or furniture. I uninstall sims sometimes a bit of always go back and before my items were there, but now they're not and that really frustrated me. I actually ended up in 2017 spending  ¬£10 on sims freeplay and that's the only money I think I will ever spend on ot now because if you restart,  you don't get anything you wanted. Please fix this because I spent that money and I could've bought something else with it but I didn't because I like sims.",
        "Overall,  this is a great game. Two requests.  1) Selling multiple items at once.  I bought a load of junk and I need to sell it!  2) Make the schools \"playable\",  like the police station. I was talking to my sister about this and it'd be cool if the schools were playable and you could build clubs inside it. Anyway,  I loved everything in the game! So fun,  so creative.",
        "First, I don't like that the game is in realtime it makes it a lot less fun and more boring. Secondly, I don't like that you HAVE to buy things just to get vip. I know that the prices are quite low but if you're just a kid like me then that limits what you can do. Lastly, I want more jobs and maybe even school to be playable it would just seem reasonable and make the game more addicting. Overall the game is really enjoyable but could do better, still keep up the good work!",
        "Love it addictive,if u like the sims on the pc you will like this.If you are a patient person you don't need to spend money either. Update it has lost stars as I don't want to spend money and now you need vip to get to the next stages of things. Disappointed with this. If you didn't have to pay for anything it would be 5 stars.",
        "Im hardcore addicted to this game. I have only 2 complaints about this game. The first is that there isnt a cheaper $1 or $2 life point pack, just for like 5 life points. I love this game but not enough to spend $5 on the cheapest life points.  My second complaint is that babies almost seem to be the defult sim that you switch to as soon as you make an adult do anything. Because of this i end up just making the babies hibernate constantly because of how annoying it is if you are trying to make all your sims grow crops or something.  Other than that, i love it."

Sometimes I will go a whole day with no shields and the whole time I'm getting attacked. The other thing is the bonus spin. Never have I won more that 250k coins. I know you want us to pay for another spin but maybe award a higher number once in a while. All in all cute game.",
        "This game was fun initially. But as you rank up, you gain coins and then before you get to even use them, someone is able to steal them from you (by random spinning.. no planned attack!!)   If you play this game,DO NOT SPEND MONEY TO BUY SPINS. People can steal your earnings... so you basically pay actual money, to give others coins...",

Please help and put me back to the level ahead of me as this is very upsetting for spending money and being right back where I was before. Fix it and I'll give it 5 stars for everything thank you",
        "I gave 2 star only because when i joined my frnd i did not got any spin..... Though that is shown in my village news...  This is the 2nd time missed the spin.. Do you know it is diffcult to get spin and when you convince a friend to join and you got nothing.....",
        "First everything went okay. But recently I can't download any special event. The game stall when you have  to raid or attack just loading the whole time. Even the spin is now stopping you can press the spin until your blue nothing. Maybe if this is fixed we could try for a higher rating.",

        "Overall the game itself is pretty good and worth the download for a good couple hours of fun even with a few friends. However I would highly recommend not spending any money on the in game purchases. I got ripped off, luckily with in game currency only and the \"game team\" is adamant that nothing went wrong. If that is the type of support they give I wouldn't want something to go wrong with my actual money. So long story short as long as u don't spend money u should have a good time playing",
        "I give 1star not because that game isn't game is awesome I give 1 star because of support team. I tried many time to contact them to short out my problem but they don't reply. My problem is my trophy points are above 1500 but I always find a enemy with 900 points and it takes more than 1minute to find a enemy please guys tell me what do I do it is so frustrating I can't take it anymore",

        "This had already been done much better. This game allows you to play about 30 minutes before you need to shell out money to compete. Not interested in these crooked games. When are we going to get back to some honesty and not trying to screw customers to get rich?",
        "It's awesome game with wonderful grafics. First I thought it's an exact copy of clash of Royale but when I started to play this game I thought that clash of Royale is a worst game. My suggestion is don't waste your 94mb while downloading clash of Royale better use 94mb +2mb =96mb for downloading this miracle and a wonderful game Castle Crush.üè∞üè∞üèØüèØüè∞üè∞üèØüèØ",

        "Fun & super adorable match 3 game - the only game I've kept playing for years (3-4?!) Variety of different mechanics and choice of animal helpers keep it interesting, and less frustrating than the Candy Crush games. Then again, maybe it's just because everything is so darn cute! So nice to see the New Zealand birds/animals in there too, go kiwi! :)",

What a joke a bit like the stupid pig you gave us for gold bars which you made out to be free but no... Of course you have to purchase so why put that rubbish in the game! If I wanted to check if I have PPI I'd wait for a cold caller, not an in game advert! You take the living p*ss!",
        "Hey all! Please help. I am not getting my gifts. I will get my 2 hours unlimited but not the other extras. I looked for an update but there was none. Love this game. Just need this fixed please. Thank you!"

        "First up the images used as what the game looks like are fakes. I saw too many polygons.... (Shudder) Secondly there is no start menu. NOPE! Just some fancy loading screen and boom you're in the game without a chance to look at the controls. Plus your first mission is ruined by the tutorial at the worst places on the track.   Bad game knockoff. If you download this just delete it. This game is [EXPLICATIVE]",
        "Good time waster. Especially well made in the beginning levels, but quickly becomes pay to win, as diamonds are not easily attainable and neither are coins, not to mention that later cars are very high prices and require much dedication to acquire. Controls are nice, but like with money, get worse with time. Maps are not optimized for later leveled cars, making some corners physically impossible to make even when drifting at full tilt, forcing the player to adapt to a combination of drifting, boosting and then braking to get around a bend without crashing. Otherwise, it is a very nice game for being free, although there are many ads, but that's excusable as it is a free game. I would recommend it, just not as a long term type of game.",
        "Nice game at first, my gf got angry at some point because I played it the whole time. However, I soon started playing less and less, because winning just became impossible. I respect the developers, but I wont pay to max out a cars modifications just to race that same car which is twice as fast. How does that work? Are the AI cars getting modifications from a different game?",
        "Game is fun until you get so far and can no longer upgrade to compete.  I have all stars in amateur league, yet on achievement rewards it shows I only have 1 star.  This is a problem to try to earn stars to purchase higher end cars, you can't without spending money.  Should be anle to earn all cars if you play regularly withput spending money.",
        "It would br better if you could exchange coins for diamonds, not just diamonds for coins. I also have a screen shot which shows that I should be the 1 place, yet another car which was behind me and crossed the line 1 sec later got the first place :/",
        "So many ad's, there back to back ad's. When I am finally able to select a race, guess what...another ad pops up and takes me to the play store to download it. I go back to the game and I gotta start all over again from the first screen. Ad's ad's ad's I was only able to play on the first day I downloaded it, after that..... Ad's ad's ad's                    \"AD'S!!!\".... But i did like the game when I played it"

        "I have completed level 705 but game won't let me move on to next level...keeps saying I'm offline! I'm connected online but nothing I do will let me move on to the next episode. Please KING fix this problem!  UPDATE as of 21st February: the message \"go online for more episodes\" is still showing everytime I try and play. So still not fixed in the new update! PLEASE FIX!!",
        "U want 5***'s, well hard is ridiculously too hard, it has impossible levels that  you only win,  when king wants you to, this is so utterly ridiculous! Really makes me want to uninstall the game. I will give it another try, I'm waiting for the game to divvy out more tries.. I mean 35 tries is stingy for a hard level, how about 45 tries instead?",
        "I'm a addict when it comes to all the candy crushes I'm currently on level 1060 (a really hard level) and I'm  upset cause I get almost threw with that level and the app just close very upset fix the glitch please.. Other then that like I love candy crush but it still get 4 stars!",
        "I love this game but after the latest update I lost things. I had logged in 150 days in a row and loved getting the bonuses each day. Today I logged in and it put me back to day 1!!! I know I logged in yesterday and didn't miss a day. I also was moved down a bubble level. Updates should not make you lose everything you've earned.",
        "Game won't let me move forward. Again. Keeps saying to go online to download new episodes. Only way to fix this is to redownload the app but then I lose all my items and I have to restart my days of prizes.  Last time I was at almost day 200 and had to start back at day 1. This needs to be fixed cause it's the 2nd time it's happened. Only happens with this game. The other candy crush apps don't do this.",
        "One of my favorite games, but after the most recent update, just like most of the reviews in the last several days, I'm stuck at 705. I should be at 1153. Tells me to go online and download new episodes when I'm constantly online. Need to patch it or rework the coding.   Edit: finally fixed, everything is running smoothly. Thanks!"

        "I AM OBSESSED!!! This game is awesome, I love shooting things that deserve to be shot!!! The only problem is that you need to be a certain level to buy something and how there's only boots and helmets, and no chest plates or leggings, but when I first played it I was shocked to find 2 problems in an amazing app! 5 stars everything! Also, you should make huge, amazing looking, almost impossible bosses that will make me flip my table when I can't beat them! Keep making more awesome games!",
        "This game would be perfect if the controls were better. They are nonsense. Doesn't always shoot when I tap, jumping is crazy, and the game gives you multiple ways to control, but they are all garbage. Also would have appreciated a tutorial so I knew what I was doing",
        "I'm really loving this game it's simple but still a ton of fun. My one complaint would be the sometimes the grind is too long and I almost gave up... I wish the developers would throw in some kind of experience boost in the store instead of just being able to buy coins. I would pay real money for an exp boost and would love to support the Developers! just give me the chance!",
        "I can't help but love a mobile game that doesn't constantly shove advertisements in your face. No silly energy system to make you wait to play, and while it has a real money store, it's tucked away in a corner where it belongs. Different control options and simple, accessible gameplay make this a hidden gem. 5 stars all the way. Kudos to the developer.",
        "I absoblutly(i think i spelt the word before this wrong...oh well)love this game but i do have some suggestions.  Firstly  it think there should be more diverse boss like mire enemies having boss versions of themselves.  Mayve hell mode should have bosses every ten to fifteen waves ir maybe just a hardcore hell mode.  I would really appreciate even more of a challenge.  Lastly i think acheivments to earn things like more hashes or bitcoins would also be fun and add a little bit of flovor to the game.  Well that is all i got.  I hope yall read all of this.  I really love the game.",
        "Excellent game, can't wait for a new map. There isn't any tutorials but it's quite a simple and fun game, you will catch on quick just be patient. Hope to see new maps soon don't make it too easy on us high levels now : )"

I again installed it and started from the beginning and after completing 573 games & 1487 stars I am giving you just 2star rating because game lag all the time sometimes the ads got struck or maybe during rewind I lose my $1 but the game didn't rewind back instead crash and auto shutdown and I ahve to start the application again. Before adding 30th season please update your games stability it will be more useful.",
        "Like most other games, there is too much effort to bait you into micro transactions. The older games were so much better. It's a shame the Devs have resorted to such money grabbing standards.",
        "I like the tactic aspect of it, pretty good time waster. Took me a while to beat it, but didn't have to spend a dollar to do it. The story itself is very unrealistic and after 15 seasons I completely stopped following it and focused only on the games.",
        "There should be a full match game like this that isn't scripted. I love it! Should be an energy free mode maybe? As its a bit pay to win\\microtransaction heavy.  They've made some changes, if you like ads and Facebook popping up after everything you do, then this is the game for you, dropped my rating 1 star as a result.  Also took out the ability to watch adverts for in game currency, now you have to pay. Even more of a cash grab now.",
        "Really good game but just wish you didn't always have to go back and start from scratch on certain levels. Oh and maybe make buying the boots and haircuts etc a bit cheaper! Otherwise love it.",
        "Basically a pay to win game. Would be more enjoyable with ads rather than forcing people to wait for 15 minutes to gain less than 1 minute of gameplay as a reward. It's an enjoyable game but not enjoyable enough to pay for."

        "Solid mahjong solitaire.   Lots of boards, and daily puzzles to play.  A little heavy on the ads if you want to play days in the month you've already passed.  And ads in between each lvl.  You can pay 2 bucks to remove the ads, but isn't necessarily going to make the experience better.  The ads are short, for the most part, but still can get annoying if you've played 10 puzzles in a row.  And considering you can complete a puzzle under or around the 2 min mark, those ads add up.  Worth a dl if you enjoy this type of game.",

        "Dear two man and a Dog, This is the best game I have ever played in my life. But some thing is still missing. After catching zombies the drone search for zombies.It takes few miniutes.I would like to request you guys that add a mode where I can catch zombies and earn some reward. This mode will not support drone. it is endless mode. I can play whenever I want it wont support finding zombies time.Also please maje the levels more bigger. I mean the levels are too small.Also make the drones more cheaper.  Last and final add 2 maps name underworld aand desert. This wil make the game more interesting.If u add this update quickly next time this game will get 5 stars.Thank you very much.",
        "I love this game I have it on my tablet but there is one problem. Please please make this game compatible for Samsung galaxy s7.  Because i want to get it on my phone but it wont let me download it. It just says device not compatible. Please fix and i will rate 5 stars because i love this game.",
        "this is a really funand cute game, but the gamer does not care to keep the challenges updated for the game but gladly take your money to get drones and equipment. suggest that if you get this game do not put one cent into it . you can earn what you need to get tools and drones thaqt you need. It's a shame that a gamer will make a fun and cute game like this then just drop it. But they gladly take your money and you can see where there is plenty of room for growth. but apparently Two Men And A Dog do not care if you like their game or not they just want your money and that's it. Would have given a 5 star for this game but gamers will not keep it going and updated. shame",
        "Great game, addictive, in a good way. This is one of the few games that is addictive, but does not take up a large amount of your day, unlike some game (Clash Royale), I feel it's not Pay to Win. Great job guys, thanks for making an entertaining, relaxing, non time consuming, free to play and win game. Graphics can be bested.",
        "Funny characters, endearing cartoon aesthetic and enjoyable game play, but after a couple hunts forces you to wait over 8 minutes before you can actually play again (in order to entice you to pay to make the wait times go away). What kind of game compels you to QUIT out of BOREDOM after playing it for 5 minutes?",
        "Love he game but would not advise anyone putting any money into this game. I have had this game for over two years now. And they Do Not keep their updated. Just says new challenges coming soon. If it hasn't came in two years it probably isn't. If they would add new challenges I would love to give them a five star. But for the last two years they just want to take your money. So if this game just earn your gems to get more drones and to update her tools. Don't pay them money for not keeping this game going. Plenty of room to update they just will not do it. Shame too is a good game . Could be better with new challenges."

        "This game might not look so good when you download it, but there is a lot you can do. Buy properties to get money, buy guns armor, cars. There are plenty of minigames and quick play missions like street races, survival, and parachuting. The storyline may only be decent, but the missions are still fun.  The only real problem is the file size. You have to dedicate too much of your storage, if you have a newer phone with more built in storage, or a microSD card, you should try this game.",
        "Please reduce the cost of things on store and do something in your next update so that the player can get more and more diamonds from the hit list. Please reduce the cost of jet pack.  And when I watch videos for reward, it doesn't work. I have watched over a hundred videos but it's only two times that I got a reward.",
        "Honesty its just like GTA which a great thing but the thing is the installation time let me share my experience to one and all reading hear... When I was downloading it at the first its done but it starts downloading once again but I am not sure is it my problem but I just wanted to share with you guys... The game is boss",
        "Best game I've ever played! In fact it is the only game I've had on my phone for 2 years. But there are some minor errors that keep occurring, such as when you are running or driving any vehicle, the control pad keeps stopping and I have to lift my thumb up and put it back down to regain control. Now I know it doesn't sound like much, it can mess up your drifts and the gas will stop as well. PLEASE FIX. Thanks",
        "It's a very great game,Nothing but love.   But I got a notification  that there is an update,I updated the game but I still can't find the new added missions in the game. Secondly I am on day 87 and my day 90 supposed  Reward changed after I downloaded the update.",
        "I don't understand why  diamonds are required to craft materials. As a F2P player it is difficult for me to craft new materials. The old updates never had this rubbish. Please fix ASAP.Will install again if it is fixed."

        "It's okay and the graphics are really nice, the sound effects are good but ultimately, you play and play and play and play and still not got to the other towns. I've got to about the 7th and had enough of trying to get further and not progressing much. It's okay for a few days but after that, and like someone else has mentioned about the ads, too many to get little rewards",
        "Really fun and adictingl but for samsung galaxy core prime this game has A LOT of bugs and glitches. Tried to play for more than five minutes is making the phone first freeze the screen then restart itself. Some cabs never arrive. Need a lot of bugfixes right now. Other than that it is a good game that i like.",
        "For a game so heavily reliant on ads to deliver benefits to the player, it is a gamble sometimes whether or not those ads will crash the game and therefore cost you the prizes. The game itself is all right, but this gamble drags down the experience when it doesn't work.",
        "It's like owning your own transportation service like Uber or Lyft, but in arcade Crazy Taxi meets Monopoly. If you hire drivers to your service, you not only make more money, but you expand your  territory. I love the diversity of the characters, how you have new with the classic arcade characters like Axel, Gus and Gena. And I also love the concept is modern, but has the classic arcade concept and feel with the scratch cards, gems, and money. Bonuses are earned through accomplishing objectives, and of course, ads. Thanks Sega. üëåüëç‚ù§",
        "Outstanding game. My only fuss is cars get trapped in some buildings during attempts to retrieve funds. Going back to another stage and returning to the stage I'm engaged in usually resets game play. Otherwise, great game.",
        "It's a chilled game to play. There are a bit too many ads. And it because it is just tapping, it can be a bit boring after a while. It takes long before you get somewhere new. But all by all it's a free easy game to kill time perfectly."

        "Great game, fun to play.  Only things I don't like are the fact there are so many ads and not just short ads long videos which is really annoying, and second and probable the biggest issue I found is that there is no single player option! I have to have like 10+ games going to enjoy playing if my partners arent online or play often. Would be much better if there was single player option",
        "Ads are too long and frequent but other than that, it's good.  It could do with more English stuff though. I have no idea what gym chains are in the U.S or discount stores or supermarkets for that matter but I do know England. Some rounds I can't take part in and end up losing the game because if it. Also, a lot of English synonyms aren't recognised either. I'd enjoy the game even more if I could relate to all of it.",

Lovee It!",
        "Great game. Really fun buy id love to be able to play without having to wait for someone to challenge me or vice versa. A single player option would be fun. Also i payed 3.69$ to have no ads but i sometimes still grt the very long ad videos which i find a little annoying since i payed for no ads... But other then that great game üòä",
        "Update:  now the game won't let me start a new game.   Original post: Buggy to say the least. Paid to remove ads since it was only .99. And now the game randomly quits, and erases any games I've started when I exit from the game for any period of time. Was find until I removed the ads. Great way to treat the people paying your bills.",
        "This is an awesome game. A few suggestions though: Think it will be more fun if players play at the same time. Also why is fight list 2 not on the Play Store? I also think you should consider more international answers for questions that have a broader scope like  the one about Coca-Cola brands. All the ones available in my country were not recognized as answers. Great game !!!"

The battleships and details are amazing and even better when you're in battle. To all future fleet commanders download and enjoy plus I've been playing this for over a year or so now and it still is my go to game. So if you're new to Rpg try this one. All hands to battle station's.",
        "Movga not answer requests, game very expensive if you want to play and on the top of this you could not trust developers  because you are charged for items you did not get,graphic effects your eyes  and if you're longer playing you could asleep. All the time game crashes and stalls, Samsung galaxy S7 was locked several times. Game is developed for crazy profit  and normally you should pay to have fun  otherwise some one will but not you.",
        "The game seems to go through faze's some times good some times just ok. If you only speak english it can be very taxing, not to friendly at times. Has a very clicky higher archery . If you fall out with them you can have wasted all the money you put into the game.",
        "Great game. Kills time and unfortunately my battery too. Would be good to have a facility to tell you your battery strength (may be next to the clock?). One of the better RPG I have played and updates aren't obtrusive.",
        "Game would be better if was based on skills rather than how much money you can spend on it. They should remove prosperity as it is abused before legion battles or regional battles. The players with the deepest pockets win no skills required... I love the game but the model is wrong.",
        "The translator needs fixing,  it's ok but could be a lot better,diamonds keep vanishing and there are other issues in game I don't like, it seems some legiins have preferential treatment regarding tasks and rewards. Other issues with the chat keyboard freezing or not working properly."

On the plus side, I like how it has stickers and how you can make your own ean I think that factor is really cool and a way to interact with the game.",
        "I played 3 years ago, then came back now, alot changed! I still love it! Though, when I'm playing the game with Botch, and I cover up the bullet holes, my phone only allows 2 fingers to touch at once, so I usually can't complete the daily challenges, so I think that we should have the option to disable that gameüëç",
        "OMG BEST GAME EVERRR IT HAS SO MANY NEW GAMES IN IT & A SPECIAL VALENTINE'S ADDITION! U CAN EVEN CREATE YOUR OWN DUMB WAY TO DIE CHARACTER!!!! PLEASE DOWNLOAD DONT MISS OUT! And about the ads there are a lot of them but if u turn of wifi and data then u won't have a problem with the ads cause they don't show up!              Please pledge to be safe aroun trains",
        "This game is both funny as serious it's a great way to make kids understand the danger of some things around them. Like trains and wires and different things. As funny and silly this app is it can be a bit gross. Like blood and organs and stuff. The more this game updates the better it gets keep those updates coming. GREAT game.",
        "This game is really good and fun but strate after you lose all 3 of your lives it goes straight onto an add. There are loads of adds and I don't think it needs that much adds for a game like dumb ways to die, on the other hand it's a grate game and it's a laugh and a joke, I think it's a really good game‚ò∫",
        "I like it a lot this game is so good but there is one thing that really bugs me.  There is way to many ads.  Every time I play a set of games to get a good score and I click play again or main menu or practice it gives me an ad.  This really bothers me please put less ads or at least do not make them quite as long."

        "It's very good, indeed! The questions are truly endless, which is veru  refreshing (literally), although some questions are a bit too scientific for me, but I can't blame the game for my lack of knowledge in this specific field. However, I can even it out because most of the scientific terms are basically in Greek, so I unerstand what most of them mean and answer a few science questions correctly. Apart from that, there is history, geography, grammar and spelling, politics, art, the pop culture in general. Being Greek, I feared that the majority of questions would have to do with USA stuff, like most of the other quizes, but it's not. This game asks questions about things that are taking or have taken place all around the world and sometimes the correct answer demands very specific knowledge. It's a great quiz!",
        "Seems the majority of questions relate to ancient times.  Not common knowledge.  A bit frustrating. Also, loss of points for wrong answers much greater than points gained for correct answers. Seems a bit unfair.  Fun game however.",
        "A rare gem in a sea of horrible game apps. Ads are rare and the questions challenging. A great way to exercise my brain or kill time at the DMV. I'm hooked!",
        "Love that there are no \"pop culture\" questions so it really is general knowledge. I would like to see maybe a few more natural history questions :)",
        "I've been looking for a decent trivia game since leaving quizup (when they introduced pay-to-win xp boosters). This game fills the gap nicely.",
        "You don' t want to start the game up in the game. You wanna get a menu screen. Other than that, not bad."

So as I'm really generous I will give it lots of stars and a it's okay game plz remove all adds and yeah that will be fine okay ‚ò∫üòôüòò",
        "Been playing this on android forever and its great but now the ads between games ruin it. No longer relaxing. I'm going to stop playing if this form of advertising doesn't stop",
        "Update: the game keeps stealing coins from me. I had 227 coins, won a single prize, immediately play a game or two with the character, and the next time I looked I only had 16 coins. And that is not the only time it has done that. Very frustrating.   Original review: The only real thing I'd love to be changed is the ability to switch it so the game slants upwards from the left to the right. That way, if you are using your right hand, your thumb doesn't block the view of oncoming traffic.",
        "Game unresponsive to any input on Nvidia Shield / Android TV as of the Feb 28 release.  It worked great before. Now the game starts but then it‚Äôs unresponsive to any input (controller, remote, keyboard). Other games work normally. I tried everything. Running latest version of OS, cleared game cash, game data, uninstalled game, restarted Nvidia Shield then reinstalled game. Same thing, not accepting any other input.  If this problem is resolved, I will edit my review back to 5 stars since I love the game."

Otherwise it's a fun game, but you won't get past the ads for too long without uninstalling likely.",

        "To many ads, even if they make the game free.. Pathetic. Conflicts with game when trying to back out of them and even crashes. Inconsistent game play, twitchy controls at times. Unplayable shots where one number on power scale is to hard the next one down is to soft.  Multi player has a feel of being rigged at times.  Potential for a good game but not yet in my books.",
        "Used to be so much better. Cameras are now not fluid, it doesn't show the hole prior to shot anymore. Truthfully, it was awesome before you made changes... It goes back to the old saying, \"why fix it if it isn't broken?\"",
        "Super fun game, but WAY TOO MANY crashes. I've been struggling with a level several times only for the game to crash mid-level and I lose all my progress getting booted back to the beginning. Infuriating!",
        "This game is good. You should try to make it a lot more like golf with friends (the Steam game). Try to make the graphics look more detailed and better. Add more maps too.",
        "Some observations: ball does not rebound off rails as they should, especially the back and side rails near the hole, where the ball hits the rail and stops dead. Part of miniature golf mastery is using the rails but not in this game. And when the ball is against a rail a shot is allowed as if the rail was not present. After a shot the screen should automatically rotate close to what the next shot would be expected so as to minimize manual rotation. I was making a long swipe to rotate almost 180¬∞ and my finger hit the power slide and an errant shot was made. Most hills are not smoothly sloped but instead very angular. Hitting the bottom of the slope causes the ball to jump in ways unanticipated rather than roll. This is golf, not basketball. I uninstalled the game because it just wasn't as fun and realistic as I had hoped.",
        "Awful controls, heavily focused on buying coins & watching ads just to play matches. Not recommended!"

        "DON'T INSTALL THIS GAME...it's just another money machine. I'd played this game for 4 month and the amount of money you have to spent to be able to level up your teams is endless. You will pay for an lootbox system and be sure...it's just a money machine with ridiculous prices...this is far away from free to play... The leveling management and so called game meta is simply stupid...\"Do you wanna lose a raid-match when your team is on 3000 and the other on 2200 points.\" ...ridiculous. Updates are just \"price enhancements\" and new modes which are only playable if you spent more money.",
        "I just did 4x 10pulls and didnt get a single 5*. Seriously, that's just poor management. Last time I spend any money. Don't spend your cash, it wont be beneficial. I wish I coukd get a refund.",
        "Despite the balancing improvements the game particularly in Raids still needs lots of improvements since someone with 400 less power than you with characters in lower tiers can still completely kick your ass. Serious detriment to wanting to continue to play if no matter how you level them up you still lose.",
        "Installed to the latest version but the screen now remains blank after the initial launchscreen.. as a paying customer (I just purchased a monthly gem pass and am only into the 4th day), I expect the developer to resolve this issue ASAP!",
        "Boring, bordering on frustrating, match-3-battle game play mechanics with a bit of restrictive City building thrown in.  The \"pvp\" match making is dreadful.  Back to marvel puzzle quest I suppose.",
        "this game is rig i spent my hard earnt gems on get a better Hero only to get  low hero for 300 gem like what a complete waste of my gem i have spent hundreds of gems only to receive some useless Hero's"

        "I love this kind of games, but this is the most incredible game i've ever played. I-N-C-R-E-D-I-B-L-E !!! I don't know & and l don't care what are u think about this game. I'm sure it's perfect for everyone. Any where, any time. I don't know why, but when l play this game l feel like l am the boss who commands to that minion who runs. I see that wonderful worlds and l feel like l'm doing all that job. When I was a little bit small, l was playing this game with my sister and the minion was ower slave. This game is very funny and, like Janise Palmer said, now l realize that l made a huge mistake. I have instaled it back and it's ok. I'm level 10 now.",
        "The game used to be fun, but not anymore.  More than that, after i did a factory reset on my phone, I've reinstalled the game, but surprise... I couldn't sync the game to my Google account. All my progress in game was lost. All the money invested in this game was lost. I have sent them emails, tickets about it but no answer what so ever. The result is ---&gt; uninstall",
        "I like this game but there's so much cheating going on. It doesn't resister some of the moves you make or it's lagging and when you smash the minions they should fly away and not stick to the screen for ten seconds so you can't see what's coming next. Just stop cheating! Don't take 20hours to give the necessary tools when doing a double task in the jelly lab.",
        "Really cool. Its just  too WEIRD. And sometimes when I try to Dodge an obstacle it won't do it. And  when the lanes bend its really Hard for me. And why do you Have to watch an ad to get free revives, get some tokens, refill the Battery for the special Mission and to open the green and blue prize pod AND to Double bananas you collect? GREAT GAME I JUST HATE THE ADS.",
        "This game is awesome and funny I guess. I'm trying to think of something to complain about (I love complaining) but I can't!! Oh wait........... You could make things like characters and stuff less expensive. It's  Ike....I go on SHOP and it says stuff like (random minion) 1234 tokens!!  Dats 2many bro!"

        "It's okay but... Why cant you put more skins than just that one skin, or make an avatar editor in the game. The character seems too dull for me and aome people may want a female character. Other than that it's a good game.",
        "3d camera the game is soooo cool but it is the camera. 3d camera is soooo emberrsing after awhile, the the game gliches.  i don't really understand the that a person on YouTube built a hot air balloon in the air. You can't do that. but, I still think that this game is very cool!!!! I give this game a 5 star even though my review is about the 3d camera.",
        "Love it! I wish that there were  villages, horses, and maybe some other animals and monsters. Could you add some boats? Maybe some potions? If you do this I will give you a 5 star rating. Thanks!",
        "Happy, then let down. I loved the app. It's exactly like minecraft. However, After about an hour of game play it kept freezing up every 5 minutes or so. Every time it froze up I would have to exit to my home screen then re-enter.",
        "It's gr8 and all, but there are some things that I want. First is crouching, it's impossible to build bridges if I'm always falling, Second is sound FX, for me it's too quiet and the fact of footsteps and moos and oinks and clucks is very good. Last IS everyone's game enemy, ADS, ads pop up in a few seconds and when building my first house you can forget what part you were on. PLEASE ADD OR FIX THESE THINGS!!!",
        "I like this game! But can you add some skin in this game?this game sometimes show the chat but i don't know how to open the chat so please fix it.Oh, and please add some block and food in creative mode because it don't have or maybe it have but i think it don't have many of it.Please do it like in minecraft pe but not all of it.üòäüòÄ"

        "I Would Give It Five Stars...but...you should make it customizable for the colors you want to cycle through as you stack higher. THIS GAME IS NOT COLOR BLIND FRIENDLY. Great Idea Though, Nice Hand Eye Coordination Exercise. (I see Black and White, so a monochrome setting would be nice. Other people see colors differently as well) Needs A Color Cycle Customizer, or a set of different options for each type of Color Blind. Thanks in advance",
        "I LOVE THIS GAME This is good game design. It rewards you no matter how high you go with a beautiful little tower. The colors are really satisfying. It keeps me engaged since you can \"regrow\" your blocks. That creates tension too--something to strive for. It's so simple but soothing and really addictive!!",
        "A Great Game For When You're Dumpin'. I decided to install it because I ran out of YouTube videos while droppin' a duce. I really enjoy and will be using it the next time I'm in here as well. The ads are there, but they aren't too bad and there is an option to remove them for a small fee as well (which I plan to do.) My time in the bathroom has flew by because of the game and I'm happy to say that. I don't like to stay too long. Great game!",
        "So,  basically it's a pretty fun app to play when you're bored. It's a great time killer, and is very challenging, but at the same time easy! It's a perfect app! I remember I downloaded this, and then I uninstalled it because I needed other apps on my phone. And now I installed it again, so then I have a fun game to play. I don't really have any games on my phone, so this is the perfect one. The inventors are genius! Five stars!!",
        "Challenging and aesthetically pleasing A well made, minimalist stacking game which takes a long time to master, with nice simple visuals, a satisfying game mechanic and good sound effects. The instant replayability makes for a good competitive game amongst friends. The only reason it doesn't have a 5* is because I feel more could have been added to it, and done with the mechanic.",
        "Good, with a major flaw I've ran into an issue that occurs about 1 out of every 3 rounds, where I'll tap, and the game won't register the trap until well after the position I wanted. For a game based on timing and your ability to stack moving blocks, when you tap is important, and needs to be 100% reliable. I'm on a Nexus 6P, very new phone with excellent hardware. I've closed all background apps, to try and troubleshoot. It's an issue I'd like to see fixed."

I already know that Gameloft will give best graphical experience ever but the game is frikkin good .but the recent update have a slight problem. It is the details of objects takes time to form fully. But the race is done before it . Please fix this problem.",

Good game, it would have been nice to be able to play against your friends over the internet also, not just wi fi. It needs rewards in local wi fi also.. S class class cars turn with 1 second delay, which is very frustrating",
        "Best racing game on Android for me. But It we have to buy credits it the most difficult process. It will be a game-changer and very good turn if We Can sale maxed out cars which we have and get credits in Return. I guess this feature will be awesome. Love this Game",

        "Several times now I've tried to type in a logo name and the app has told me I got it wrong but I thought it was right and couldn't see why I was being told I was wrong. So I hit \"solve\" and the answer is exactly what I typed in.  I have also had a few times now where I've recognised the logo but there are letters missing when I try to type in the name.  I had what I suspect to be this app deferral years ago and had no problems with it at all but since this new look and expanded number of logos has appeared it feels like you've ruined a fun app. Any chance of fixing this screw up?",
        "Love testing my knowledge but I recommend a change. Upon entering the last letter you should have the option to view before the answer is submitted. My big fingers cause me to select the incorrect letter occasionally and then I get the wrong answer and my streak is reset. Please correct this.",
        "Several times I have tried to use a hint and it  wouldn't take it off and it was difficult and easy. When I type in the logo it would tell me I'm wrong then I hit solve and it was the same thing I wrote also and if people don't know some of the logos what is the point of the game.",
        "It's too easy to amass a huge number of hints and use them. I'd like not to be able to complete every level without doing some online searches.",
        "My 6 year old son is really enjoying doing this with me! Just a little frustrating with the American logos that we're not so sure on!",
        "This app is nice. One thing I like about this app is it takes only one single unit to give a random letter hint because I have seen in many apps that they take 60 or 90 coins or whatever unit to just show a letter and this app haves daily bonus 30 coins so I love this app but I think that the app members should give a little attention on the animation because it is not so clear. Besides this all all the best for the team of this app and make good apps further."

I mean when I first downloaded it there was only 6 levels XD  I know that should be a good thing but I can't seem to finish them all lol. GREAT GAME!!! DOWNLOAD RIGHT NOW!!! LIKE... RIGHT NOW!!! IT'S AMAZING AND I BET YOU'LL HAVE IT FOR AT LEAST 4 MONTHS!!!",

        "Awesome game controls are just great but the only thing I didn't like was that the balls other than the normal one was for real money u guys could make the others balls for diamonds that we get during the gameplay  so we could also actually make use of the diamonds  otherwise the game is awesomeüëçüëçüëç",
        "Loved this app so many choices and creativity it looked like you worked hard on it so I think you put a lot of effort in it and also There's barely any adds so this is amazing you all should get this app cause its fun and a great time killer !  :P ITS AMAZING AND I LOVE IT",
        "This game is fun but one problem.  My ball keeps randomly rolling off the edge for no reason. Plz fix this then u will get 5 stars.",
        "This game is great. The levels are challenging and fun but personally I think this game could be a lot better if you added a level editor so you could make levels and post them online for others to try. This would totally make your game a lot more exciting and fun."

        "Great game, Love it! Very creative, fantastic graphics. Not so difficult or loss of life's to where you can't even play.  Yet still challenging.  Only negative is lots of ads. Would gladly pay nominal fee to get rid of them.",
        "Love it !!! Caught my eye when I saw \"pick 2\" vs. pick 3. I'm a stay at home mom kids in school 6 days week that gives me time to burn   (lol) They did a couple small tweeks which  made the \"typical pick 3 concept\"a thing of the past (FINALLY) BUT WAS ENOUGH change to make it a keeper",
        "I love playing games like this to relax, but on other similar games I can't stop myself from buying the stupid in app purchases all the time which makes me more stressed! This game is perfect because it's not so difficult that it's not fun and I don't have to worry about wasting my money on imaginary things!",
        "Not a clue if there's a story line, how the power ups work, the difference between the levels or what the deal with the chest is BUT it a cute fun game to pass the time with and relax with. It's challenging but I've yet to get completely and frustratingly stuck. This feels like a game designed for fun not to make money though \"buying lives\"",
        "This is a rip off of toy blast!  Peak Games went after hashbro MLP Puzzle party for ripping off the gameplay of toy blast by peak games. I am pissed off that they went after hashbro but not other knock offs. I liked MLP Puzzle Party this game is so boring. Not only they ripped off peak games they ripped off the music from Genies and Gems from Jam City. I will uninstall!"

There are only two places to colonize and once you've done them and reached level 10 on both, there's really nothing left to do. It would be nice if they added more levels to colonize or some other form of continuation.",
        "Before the update it was quick to grind lots of cash but still it took some time. With my current build, I was reaching 10k+ averaging Greats and Awesomes but now after the update I barely scratch 8K! You guys nerfd the fuccc out the rocket power!!! NEW PLAYERS DON'T EVEN BOTHER WITH THIS! IT WILL TAKE YOU A VERY, VERY, VERY LONG TIME TO GRIND!!!",
        "The game itself is awesome, really awesome. But my god, there is too many ads, It is okay to have ads in a free game, I totally understand, the dev has worked to build a game so it is fair to receive money back for the work.  But here there are too many ads, there is ad in game, there is ad when you lose a match and there are the famous win coins for watching a video.  Couldn't find an option to buy the game and remove the ads, hope the developer improve this, because the is really awesome...",
        "Good game, played it over a long period here and there and I've basically completed it.  Would love to see more planets! And bigger challenges, as currently every time I go on it my little explorers are making over 1.5 million a day and I've got no where to take my space funding! Haha   Great game imo, just needs more features, planets, asteroids maybe. :) Good job.",
        "It's a fun game, just need more planets to jump to and more rocket skins. The colony is just a bunch of people standing on the planet. When I think of colony, I think of buildings and sustaining life and such. Would be nice to see the 'colony' grow bigger each time you rank up. (Example, more buildings etc.) Also, a choice of a button to press when detaching the rocket and different rocket shapes to choose from. Thank you",
        "Its a great game but ive fully upgraded my earth space ship and i am level 10 on earth and mars. I have about 8000 people on europa and theres no more planets to discover so its boring now. We want alot more plants and diffrent upgrades!!"

And can you let geometry dash world players create and play user created levels. Fix and add this and I will give you 5 stars. Gameplay and graphics are nice.",

        "If you are looking for a fun game, this is not one of 'em. It is so annoying. It gets me is mad that I've DELETED it twice. But... when you win the levels you feel like you have just met Jesus. Also, the first few levels are easy.",
        "I love this game just...can you fix one glitch? On the final level final area the wave is bugged ...when I tap it goes down by itself! Can you please fix it? I was trying over 3 hours to make it but I can' t because of the glitch :( Please fix it.",
        "Got all the way to the end,  and an as popped up accidentally clicked on it cuz it was being slow,  and ended up having to restart all of the levels,  fix this,  it doesn't happen with the other geometry dash games,  just this one every time I exit my data gets deleted...  Fix then 5 stars"

        "Total ad trap! It's fine if you don't mind the same mindless levels over and over and over, skill involved is holding back to drive over things better, what story? The dude takes literally the longest route possible to get to the evac! Nearly finished it just to do so but the amount of ads/repeats you have to go through just gets worse",
        "I really like this game and its one that I can play continuously, my only problem is that I can only play once a day.. the game will work for as long as I play but as soon as I exit I can't back on until the following day. It sucks because I have to complete as much of the game as possible in a certain amount of time and that kills the fun. I can't just enjoy it and play a bit then carry on playing a bit later.. please fix this I really enjoy.this game and its getting ruined a bit for me...",
        "Yesss. I complete this game in 7 days. I can't understand the ending why that cantenar shake. It's mean the zombie are in the cantenar? It's mean part 3 will exist? Awesome game. I feel happy and relef when I complete the game and go on that ship. I think there will be a helicopter because in start there is a helicopter. But nevermind awesome game. Make part 3. Bye..... And I read there is hidden kits? What is this. Why I don't read it before. I can't find any kit. But what is kit? Nevermind I completed the game. One more time. Awesome game. Bye.....",
        "Good but buggy Good but buggy, one can earn infinite money in no time then u can upgrade ur vehicle to the max in the very first level. That destroys the fun of the game. Second if u have money in millions, the cost of the parts are also in million and so on, and even having millions of dollars in the game u might fail to upgrade vehicle sometimes  that makes no sense.",
        "You guys nailed it with this app. ;) It may not work properly for every phone out there but for mine it runs smooth and goreish to the max! Too bad we can't use our previous upgraded rides passed by level but overall.. 5 stars!",
        "Ad heavy. I understand watching ads to get extra money for upgrades, but are ads after every single race really necessary?  The game itself isn't bad. Really good time killer. The ads kind of make me want to stop playing, though."

Outfits and style choices should be free to choose the best one that advances you in the story. It's not fun playing a game that forces you to fail/have a negative outcome. Big decisions/game altering choices should cost gems that makes it fun spending your savings but ultimately free outfit/style choices please",

But, just a thing, you could like ask on every episode (that the app creators make) like 'what's your gender and preference to date' because all the creator made ones at like just girls, and I know males play as well. Not hating AT ALL,I LOVE this app SO MUCH! Just tryna help ya improve! Luv you episode! (Or make more that are inclusive of gender) MEOW LOVE U",

Without it I practically refuse to play. It doesn't seem to be available as of a few days ago. I'm glad I recently purchased. Would also be cool to have a feature where you can send passes to friends.",

First it was 5, then 3, now only 2. Not everyone has money to waste on games, especially tickets, not only that but their overpriced, like any other add on pack/item. I wouldn't even be surprised if I deleted this and redownloaded back in a year and they only give you one ticket a day.",

It ruins the story because I won't buy any diamonds. I'll rate this 5 stars if they at least change it to not as often.",
        "I LOVE IT except in pitch perfect, ALL the good choices cost 20 diamonds and I'm not wasting my money on all of that. Can you make it less often? And the passes take too long to come back. Or at least make it more passes every 3 hours"

        "The game is enjoyable but I don't care for the new animated Charlotte. Instead of adding \"realism\", she is simply annoying. Other than that, it's fairly good. The number of coins needed to continue a level with 5 extra moves is a bit much compared to the number received when you complete the level (300 vs 25-30 or so). I understand, though. It can't be too easy or else it would be boring & nobody would ever spend any $ to advance!üòÅ",

        "This is overall the best golf game I have come across or any app, in general, relating to sports. My only problem is that sometimes people do not want to, not do not have the ability to create a facebook account. I wish there would be a way to play with your family; without the facebook account users perks.",
        "I like the game, and it's addictive, but the mechanics are absolutely flawed. There have been tons of instances where the game has unfairly screwed me or other player's over. 1. Places mystery boxes in front of the player who drives second, but not the first player. 2. Hills like to stop a ball, that is being shot full force by an iron club, in it's tracks. 3. The swinging spike balls only affect some players golf balls, but not others.  Things like this piss people off, because they expect the game to be fair. Those small things easily aid a player in losing a match.",
        "This game would be awesome if it matched you with people equal to your level but it doesn't. So I spend more time trying to get to the higher levels and not able to upgrade equipment. Of course you could always purchase money but I'm not big on doibg that!",
        "Game cheats, puts you against lower lol players with better equipment who make ungodly shots, or much higher level where you don't have a chance. I hit things that aren't there, and with a crossword my ball will fly into the wind with no action. Opponent Always get better wind and direction, and will outshoot you work lower equipmeny.",
        "I love the game I find it very entertaining. I also like being able to interact globally. But the only one thing that I would change, would be to make the analog where you pull back your driver smaller screened devices. Besides that I have no complaints. I love the game! üòäüòä",
        "The game doesnt allow you to get a proper pull back on your swing. To much clutter on some stages. Plus those who play too win always beat those who dont"

This happens very frequently. Lastly, had 20 straight of same color. Only needed one of another color to finish that level. Still playing, but game is very frustrating.",

Level 324 the colors are not chain linked they are totally erratic and the colors you're given are inconsistent. They alternate in color as well to ensure failure. Still I enjoyed it. Side note, I played the game without using any cheats, which is the reason level 324 is a trapdoor the idea is to purchase cheats. Thanks great game.",

It's a game I selected to relax my mind but it quite becoming the opposite. I cannot give a 5*",

But it still needs a bit more to improve.. I would love it even more if you had more stuff.. And if you didnt had to pay for anything  at all.. Also, please just open the spa and the other stuff you cant get unless you pay!",

        "It's a cool game, it just could be better and maybe there could be some other things in the update. Don't take it seriously! I'm not trying to be mean but maybe there could be some other leotards and the update and some more hair dues because all of those buns and people may not like that's just buns people may want the braids that you always have in your other games. I mean the French braids and they keep going down into a braid, all those things would be nice!",
        "This is from my daughter, \"I like the game but there's some things about it I kind of don't understand. Some of the controls are a little difficult like the one where you have to tap 1 or tap 2 when she's practicing. And its fun. Some of it I like a lot.\"   This is from me, \"the app is annoying until you buy it. It downloaded a ton of icons (ads for other games) to my picture gallery without informing me. My daughter likes the game a lot and it's fun, but a bit intrusive with the free version. The gameplay is good overall.\"",
        "Still waiting for an update to get the other two activities for the gymnastics   How long to you expect us to wait, some of us have paid money on this   Please hurry up and get it updated please"

Its now like a small kid can play. Their is no fun n pressure of making the right punch or through as the good old days. If you guys can make a lit like that, then its will more gold in a gold mine. Otherwise is a nice game.  Thank you",
        "Samsung Galaxy S6... Alright, they went and fixed the release bug crashes within a day or two. I finally got to enjoy the game. It's pretty decent. I'm enjoying the whole fighting/build your characters concept. As promised, I've raised my rating. (Probably could give more on the post mission drops) other than that, I love how there isn't a limit to how many missions you can do and have to wait for an energy bar to replenish. Great game so far. (Give more on the drops though lol... seriously)",
        "First off, the thought of the game and concept of direction it went in for a mobile game is fair, I'll give it that. But... I will say, being one of the best franchises ever created, I expected more. Not another knockoff style of Marvel and DC's (and MK's) style of fighting game. I expected originality from an original creator. The having to heal and near impossibility of play at a certain point (unless you pay a lot...) steered me away from it, tbh.",
        "As expected, it looks and performs amazing. Fighting mechanics and modes are pretty innovative and thrilling. It is quite stupid to compare the console version with mobile one. Each one has its own unique style, so they should NOT look the same, cz' each one provides the fans with a different gaming experience. This surely increases the already huge number of fans of Tekken. 5 üåü game",
        "I played this game and it has a best graphics play on the go,but i played it more then 10 day and the daily reward again started from the beginning the day one after updating the game of 175 mb data from playstore. Its not good, One more que my Koed fighter were locked by arrangement somewhere JODO records ,anyone will help me out to rearrange them again.",
        "Am I ever going to play this game?  All it does is download stuff Update:. Graphics are great, game play is ok, seems like I'm just hitting random parts of my screen.  Healing component is going to make me uninstall.  There's no area to practice to figure out what you're actually doing."

        "When it's not crashing, it's fun to play.  Sucks when it doesn't load of locks up during game play.  Also it gets expensive as you have to buy packs at $99 a pop after the 1st 2.  The game play is addicting, but no fun if you cannot afford the special offers they continue to throw in your face every time you log in.  I love final fantasy games but this particular one is a money pit!.  Not to mention the constant crashing",
        "Please understand that there is really nothing free about this game except the install. While the gameplay WAS very promising at first, purchaseable bonus packs take any strategy completely out of the game. Now, in addition, each new element of the game that has been released in recent weeks requires cash to unlock. I can only use about half of the games features now. Bummer. If you're willing to pay, have a blast with this game. Otherwise leave it alone!",
        "I started this game when it first came out. There were hardly any game advantages and everyone was having fun and on the same playing field. As more and more packages got released into the game it became a pay to win situation. I personally do not think spending $100+ on a phone game is a wise investment. Thus I enjoyed the game by taking advantage of their events and the prizes within the game. However, it has become dominated by people who payed to be the big guy and the little people get absolutely demolished. It has taken the fun out of playing, which really dissapoints me as it was a fun game to play.",
        "This game has potential to be fun but it's completely ruined because IT'S COMPLETELY PAY-TO-WIN which sucked the fun out of the game that I quit. Don't get me wrong, Final Fantasy is highly respected RPG franchise because it's full of great games in the series. But no this one.  However, I might come back if the game developers make it not as pay-to-win as it is now. Right now, it's a complete money bucket!",
        "This game is great and fun, I love spending my time playing this game. One problem though, what is going on with the packages? Why is it every time a package is bought all the packages go from 20 to 100 dollars ? We should be able to buy the 20 dollar packages more than once! Is that fixable? Please cuz i do want to keep playing but 100 dollars is too much."

The game is currently saturated with lvl 140 players with all the prestige weapons, so I'd request you to bring about a balanced match making in the PvP based on their matching levels and introduce some welcome benefits for the returning players",
        "It's a best game on playstore!!! I play it lot of.. and it's my favourite game.. but one problem is that when i start multiplayer match it says sercer not found or server overloaded. But it doesent matter for much. I give all 5 star for best graphics, bedt controls, and also bestest weapons. I love this game. Thank you gameloft. We expect that you will keep developing games like modern combat. I am waiting anxiously for next series. Thank you.",
        "This probably the best FPS game in the Play Store. Graphics, animations, music, voice actings everything in this game are awesome. üòä  The game runs in my phone in full 60 fps on Ultra-high settings. But sometimes it crashes without any reason and when I run the game again, it starts to verify game data. My phone is not rooted and I do believe the problem is not in my phone, it's a bug in the game. üòï  Overall, it's a great game. ‚ò∫Ô∏è  Peace out. ü§ò",
        "Fantastic game! It's by Gameloft so it's bound to be a good phone game. It's not unfair, but you do have to have some skill. It doesn't hold your hand but it's not hard to learn the controls. Despite the fact that you're also playing against people who are on their computers as well, it's definitely not unfair. One request: maybe add more options for your killstreaks. I would love to have my drone and turret on the same killstreak for my sniper class but I'm stuck with recon instead. Still love it tho :)",
        "It's pretty good for what it is, but the controls suck. It's hard to aim and you risk firing instead of moving your aim. Rules of survival has a better fighting setup however it's a battle Royale not a traditional fps. A bit sad that they did it better really. Final nail in the coffin is the pay to win aspect. There's multiple classes in this game and by far, the paid classes provide incredible perks. I don't recommend this game.",
        "This game is awesome.  But plzzzz ban clone paragon  first plzz plzz plzz.  Every match i see 2 or three paragon...  And mc5 is best game so far... One more thing this game turn into pay to win i think so plzzz reduce  the pay to win system and in match give 40 to 50 credit 10 credit is very lowest credit  to unlock items.... So plzzzz ban paragon first and give extra free credit  resources to earn in multilayer match...."

        "I LOVE this game ... like I am so hooked.... I spend way too much money though because I love all the dragons so much just so adorable I always buy the dragon bundles.   It does suck whenever you get so high up with feeding your dragons then it costs a lot of food to feed them like if I didn't buy so many dragon bundles I would have a hard time feeding them to higher levels... Even now it's hard.  Anyways I am addicted to this game though other than that!  ‚ô°‚ô°",
        "Shame I couldn't transfer my data from Windows 10 Mobile to Android. Would've been nice to continue my game instead of having to start afresh, but it's still a good game, and probably a better experience on Android.  It would be nice to be able to trade dragon eggs and other objects from my inventory with friends.",
        "This game is so bad I almost died of cuteness from the dragons. Firstly: you could try to make a breeding guide to help plays find what dragons to breed so they get their dragon the want. Secondly: the dragon and animations are just wonderful and adorable. Lastly: I would definitely recommend this to be installed by lovers of dragons and fantasy or anything like an interesting of this game. Even if the person hasn't got interest in would suggest them to try it because it's really fun",
        "This game is very addictive, fun, and a great game over all. Eventually if you play it long enough there isn't much you can do on the app until you wait but other then that it's a decent time killer. I haven't ran into any issues with the game and I recomended installing it",
        "Love this game cause it fun and cute! And I've been playing this game for while and love it. By way Please rid ads video pop-up cause it is annoy, it would waste our time if popup too much and it would need limit, also it ate battery if you do that I will give 5 stars. Events are good and bad cause it is fun but hard time to finish  beacuse we need our live as sleep other to do.  Maybe it need extra.",
        "Honestly a great game. It has ads but those are optional. You only view ads if you want some extra stuff. You click on a button to view the ads and after, depending on what you picked you wanted, you get. So please don't think that the ads just randomly pop-up out of nowhere. They only appear if you choose for them to be there. I'd say download the game, you won't regret it üëç"

This game is not bad at all.....so far. We'll see! I can't wait too long to decide though! A new series has a time limit, Thanks for that!",

I still like game though I just hope u add that",

        "Although the game is really  good in every aspect, but when it comes to limited time events  i have to play day and night to win a car. It really gives you a bad effect on mind which ruins the fun of playing the game. They should be made a little easy which keeps the fun of playing. After the new update there is a problem. Whenever i see an advertisement to reduce waiting time for tickets, the time won't reduce and this happens like 10 to 20 times in a day.",
        "The game starts off good in the first couple levels. But once you start getting to the faster cars, it becomes way harder to keep up with the cars PR points, to get to better races. Unless you spend real money to get the parts. One question I do have. Is about the blackridge rivals. Why put some one with a car at a way higher level against a person who's car isn't even close to the car at a high level, and one more thing... make the races longer. 20 seconds a race isn't fun at all. Thinking with the name \"Need For Speed\". You guys would of done a lot better. The only thing that I seem to like are the  graphics... But that's about it...",
        "Goog game, adddictive infact. But I don't understand the concept of PATANJALI adds. Whenever i choose to see adds to reduce the waiting time, you comeup with Patanjali adds of 10 and 20 seconds and the irritating part is the time doesn't gets reduced even after watching the whole add. Please fix this. When you say reduce wait time by watching add, you need to actually reduce the waiting time after the add instead of insisting to watch the add again and again."

        "I rather enjoy the game a lot. It feels balanced for the most part,  leveling takes a while which wouldn't be a issue if it didn't take so long to go place to place. Gets sort of annoying to go back and forth trying to get resources and the game goes from fun to grindy quickly.   My main issue is the battery life of my phone. While charging my phone and playing this game but battery was being drained.  Graphics are good, I enjoy the crafting and base building, the combat is nice, and the auto harvest feature is a life saver.",
        "**UPDATE** Is an awesome game. Could use a few more perks (ie. Weapons and hard to get items) in drop boxes and yellow zones.Now the down side is if you die in a level your last position is no longer there to try and recoup some of your items. Players killing you as you open trunks in inventory. Oh ya and the free spin box...give random prizes instead of coins and rope. People will get really into it if perks are awesome. Great game could be the best with a couple tweaks. Awesome job.",
        "I love this game...graphics r awesome... The whole thing is very captivating n keeps u entertained for hours... My only issue is that it can't be played offline... I don't always have Wi-Fi connection available to me so that alone is a headache...otherwise it is the best game out there under thist. Keeping them coming please!!",
        "Just another game that either makes you wait to play it, or pay not to wait. Why? Don't make me pay not to wait. Entice me to pay with cool things, otherwise it's an instant uninstall. Poor business model. Imagine paying double to get them to make your food faster at a restaurant, or just wait a long time. Would you really keep going there, or somewhere else that makes something just as good but in a reasonable amount of time?",
        "2 stars just to draw ur attention...  I love this game.. Its the best game... Just wannna say..  Name that Unknown free  box to #coin box...  If u dont wanna give any other thing.. Just don't show fake thing if everytime it is gonna end up on a coin..  Else i love the game.. Get more updates fast",
        "Anyway i edit this review... The is nice and graphics are cool. But there is the problem on the game. Could you pls remove the energy bar so i can still play the without waiting to fill the energy bar... Cause otherwise i less play this game in days... that you know you must wait your energy bar to fill again in a couple of minutes if the energy is gone?. Pls Remove it so we can play all day along.. Thank you."

        "If you've liked the first game you're probably gonna enjoy this one. It's more dynamic and there are plenty more content. Unfortunately it's built around microtransactions so if you're feeling like expending some money things might get easier. I just don't understand how they  screwed the controls this much, it's likely you're going to try placing a plant more than three times before making it.",
        "Great game. Lots of fun. For those who aren't aware: Some levels are super hard to beat BECAUSE THEY REQUIRE UPGRADED PLANTS. Level up gives you something to do in the game expanding its lifespan. Level up is not that easy. Don't expect to end all levels Ancient Egypt with level 2 plants; level 3 or 4 are fine!",
        "I love this game! One thing though, I believe that there are too many plants that cost real money to get. Could you please make some more plants that you can get them by being able to unlock them by playing the game, instead of ones where you have to use real money. Besides that, this is a really great game!",
        "Love this game so much! I am a huge PVZ fan anyway and I love playing this. You do need some boosters to get past levels, which feels a bit like cheating sometimes, but you can earn plenty of coins. There is always a new quest to play so even when I'm stuck on the other levels I can still play. This is a great game, well done devs!",
        "Ok its annoying and frustrating if you accidentally press a power up button and waste your zombie coins can you add like a thing lile when you press the power up button down below there would like something pop up like \"Are you sure your gonna use this power up?\" \"Yes or no\" to lessen accidents :(",
        "Please help! The game crashed so I reinstalled it, now none of my progress is saved even though I'm signed in to Google+, this is the 2nd time this had happened and I can't start from scratch again. Can someone suggest a resolution Please?"

        "I have only had this game for a few days, so I can't write a very comprehensive review just yet. But I have good feeling about this game. It is fun, challenging, with easy-to-learn controls. Less fast paced than Dragon SIM and less worlds and bosses. Customization is better though, and slower pacing may mean more long-term fun; not over so fast. Multiplayer is always a plus. Not pay-to-play, though paying gets you more benefits, it's up to you how you want to go about getting coins and acorns. Great game, few problems, would recommend.",
        "Most awesome wolf simulator game I have ever played! The graphics are absolutely beautiful, and the controls are pretty good. Although getting attacked by several animals at once when you only go for one makes completing missions pretty hard. And you should be able to run from a fight if you're losing, instead of having animals come at you until you're dead. All in all a great game play experience though. I love it!",
        "Man i love this game!!! So much better than wolfquest!!! I do hope tht this game soon be added new things like more animal to play as, better in performance. The ad free guys...keep it up!!! Just wondering if there's a add as mate system in multiplayer in the future? Anyways....this is the best wolf game tht i played!!! Do hope tht you guys one day add more animals to play as (like a snow leopard for example)",
        "Could you add more animals to play as? And a world idea could be a dessert. I love this game, and the others you've made, so I know you will make awesome updates soon! Keep up the good work. If you fixed the glitch were you eat and jump at the same time you fly, if you fixed that can you please put it back. It was fun... XD",
        "Love it but pleeeeeaaaase make it possible to play as a boar or a rabbit or deer. Also I think it would be really nice to have a hunger and thirst bar because there is no real point in drinking. That way if you dont have enough food or water you start to lose health.  Also I don't think we really need stamina from the food we eat.  These are just suggestions but I really really love this game.  Best simulator out there.",
        "It just lags now. The new update made it to where my chat, my character, and my animations won't work. I run about as fast as a turtle, and I am not pregnant. Please fix!!!! I love this game. I have a few questions if you don't mind... Can you guys add in multi-player mode, like single player mode, that we can pick up our pups, it would be cool to add that option in the top left menu. Thank you guys so much!! Love the games!!"

I have a galaxy s8 plus and when I put the controls on large, it feels like there on medium. If your playing duel and your opponent has 5 power points ahead of you, just call it a lost. Do better. Battlefront 2 is about to be banned in Germany because of the card system. I hope you look into it.  Edited: it's still the same. It feels like a pay to win. I'm going back to shadow fight 2. You know. The good one.",
        "I really like playing the game. It has great animations smooth gameplay and isn't too easy or hard. The one thing I dont like is you can't sell your old equipment or skills. If there was a shop to sell them or add runes to them or be able to combine them to make either new or more powerful ones of the sane type I would give this game 5 stars.hopefully the Devs will take this and add this feature in a update. Speaking of updates, I just installed the latest one it was like 403MB but nothing changed! What was the update for then?",
        "Hey NEKKI i have the best suggestion ever. WHY DON'T YOU add a grab button separately or at least give the option. Also make the side quest more satisfying. Just giving me commons just isn't going to work. Please nerf the herlad faction. 1 its crit chance is to stupidly high 17 percent is to much. Its also so quick and has long range",
        "Would be great if there were a better sign in feature. I had to restore factory settings on my phone... Now the game won't allow me to log into my account. Which sucks a lot, I have spent money on microtransactions and a bit of time into leveling up. But now that seems to be all gone...",
        "The game is a lot of fun but there's one big problem the only way to advance in the story mode is by leveling up and getting better armor but the only way to level up is in story mode so your other option is spend real money on better equipment. So it's kinda just a money grab. If that was fixed I'd give it 10 stars",
        "Amazing graphics,  smooth gameplay.  But the biggest problem is upgrading,  why the hell does a common chest need 3 hrs to open?  Do you want us to keep playing or play only around 5 times the whole day?  And only four slots for chests and then 3 hrs to open?"

        "I used to love this game, very addictive but recent updates have made the game have too many elements (clubs - who cares???) Ads all over and money disappears quickly due to cost of each game.  Not easy to complete games it feels \"fixed\" with random cards plus drains the battery on my phone.  Uninstalled.",
        "This is my 3rd review. Love the game but had issues when ads were introduced. That was rectified, then had issues with new Android version. That was fixed and game was going fantastically for about 3 weeks and now they have reduced the amount of free treasure to $1000 instead of $5000. This means I need to come back 3x more often without playing a single game just to be able to play once.",
        "I would like it more if in the perk levels it showed how many club points were needed for each level and how many more are needed to finish the perk level. The green filling up the bar doesn't really accurately show how close you are. It looks like you are almost done, but then it takes forever to fill up so you don't know how many more points you need.",
        "This game has many issues! It continually freezes and shuts me down. I can no longer play on my tablet, which I purchased just for games, and have to use my phone. I don't like using my phone because it drains my battery. I am so ready to quit this game and return to candy crush instead. Latest updates have rendered JP and other perks useless.",
        "Originally I really liked this game BUT the further you go the  more it costs to play.  That was ok, but you add more and more ads in there, they are on the \"boards\" they are between the games, between the levels and NOW you have Tri Peaks Solitaire brought to you by, yet another game. I like it, as a game it's addictive and was  fun but I think I have had enough.  It's becoming not so much fun and headed for the uninstall list.",
        "I don't know if a review is still available  after a game has been deleted. The game was fun to play I'll say that. I didn't need 5 push notifications coming @ me in the middle of the night however. The one that came through @ 3:17 a.m. was it for me, I'm out."

        "As much as I really love the artwork and gameplay, there is still an issue: can you please make all of the current and future makeups compatible with all skin tones? It's not really fair for those who aren't of pale skin. Thank you for all the progress and work made so far, & I really hope that there's a way you can make this happen. Thanks!   (I would give a full five stars if everyone could have equal ability to wear different makeups)",
        "I never write reviews, but this game deserves all the praise possible. Downloaded it for my niece and turns out I am the one addicted!! I'm a daily player now and love the fact that you can start your own group for 300 gems and approve applications and interact with your stylist association members. That aspect took the game to a whole new level. The clothing is beautiful and the attention to detail is great!!! Give it a shot and you just may become addicted like myself. I do spend around 20 bucks a week, but it was just as much fun before I was spending money, I just wanted the special clothes for events.",
        "I love the game. From its cute and addictive style to its unique and original dress up gameplay, it turned me from a dress up hater to lover. But I feel like there's a Paywall especially during events, and diamonds are forced to be bought, but they can be earned, which is good. But so far, you seem to have listened to feedback, from the skin tones to the bug fixes. But I love it still.",
        "In depth in both gameplay and attention to details of awarded items. Continuous hours not required but with once a day of incentive activities. Controls are  sometimes unstable. If a glitch does happen, its fixed fast and your also awarded for time spent. Very happy customer. Enjoyed the best dress up game I've played so far. Thank you makers!",
        "I've been playing this game for about 5 months now, it has amazing graphics and wonderful gameplay. My only problem with it is a lot of the times its very difficult to obtain the events suits. I feel like the only way for you to complete a suit is to spend some sort of cash. I get that you have to make an earning but it just makes the game annoying to play. I would also like more skin tone options and would like the makeup to be compatible. Anyways thank you for creating a wonderful game.",
        "Lovely game! Gorgeous clothes and gameplay. A little cheesy in. The story but fairly creative for a dress up game. Plus it can be hilarious with how wild the lore gets around fashion. Design can be a little overcrowded sometimes but everything is coordinated so it still looks nice. Backgrounds are gorgeously painted. Tutorial is easy to understand but isnt too tedious. I am officially addicted"

You don't need wifi or the internet because this game is for offline, local multiplayer.You can play the games with random people on a dance party, or use them as icebreaker in awkward situations like your first date. The app is also ideal for married couples to play together, for brothers and sisters, kids and parents, and for friends to pass the time. For some reason, these two player games tend to get very competitive and funny.Each of the games is a two player game with extra modes for 3, 4, 5 and 6 players. The more people playing together, the more fun! But if you have no one around to play with, you can also play alone in the 1-player mode to train your skills for your later victories when you play with your friends.We've got mini-games here with unique rules, but also re-makes of famous mobile hits. They are all adapted to the crazy requirement of letting up to 6 players play on the same screen. For example:- multiplayer endless runner- multiplayer birds with flapping wings- platform jumping game- 3-in-a-row with Tic-Tac-Toe like rules- crossing a busy road together- bingo- a strategy game where you send armies to capture castles (has nasty AI in single-player)- football / soccer (close to Pong and hockey)- a multiplayer version of the 1024/2048 puzzle- tapping only your own tiles- balloon poppingWe regularly add new mini-games.

So i was playing the game and i went downstairs. Then there was a button that said: \"Unlock All Rooms For 20 Minutes!\" So i clicked it and my game crashed. The button still shows up when i play the game tho. What do i do?",

        "I don't like games when you have to pay to unlock. It's quite cheap but for DOLLARS. It's a good game but I'm tired of watching an add and sometimes it doesn't work and you have nothing to do."

        "Nice game with very good events but the drop rates to heroes of 5 star is too low i killed a lot of gems and scrols and hero orbs and my first 5 star i  dropped it at lvl 75. Okok now again event of summoning 100 scrolls and i continue still no 5 star hero only 4, just try and fix the drop rate. In the rest its a nice game.",
        "Too much pay to win, free players hardly getting anywhere in the events and so fourth, not fair, increase the rewards of spending money and give free players more too easily solved, I previously rated it 5 stars instantly loved it but as I've progressed it's just not fair!! Please do something!! I am vip6 but I'm not rich, please bring more rewards for loyal free users who watch the ads and everything!! Thank you!!",
        "I purchased the spring festival card on top of all the money I've already dumped into this game and the devs didn't give me my in game rewards. I've submitted numerous tickets to get a refund or my rewards and they just reply there is no problem. Ya no problem with you taking my money.  They deleted my review, wonder how many other people had this issue and had reviews deleted.",
        "Wasn't sure about this game at first. I love it. I use a f2p  and a vip one  to see  the difference  between the two. Really well done. Having said all that the game does require patience. This is an IDLE game. You pick it up do dailies, talk, spend money, or what ever you want to do in game, then put it down to \"farm gold,xp,mats\". The high end heros do take some planning to aquire as a f2p player. This game requires patience because it's an IDLE game. Yes some people have a ton of money to throw at the game but don't be jealous, just play your game and have fun.",
        "Honestly gameplay and all is good but the game is so p2w it's not funny, it would cost u over a hundred dollars just to complete every reward for new Valentine's event. If you like this game play private server instead this version is a giant cash grab. Not competitive for f2p at all",
        "Not what I expected, given that my first impression of it was of IH being an \"annoying add\". Once I decided to pick it up though my thoughts changed rather drastically.   It's simple, it's fun and the warm colour palette of the graphics make a nice change compared to the widespread use of bleak colours in other games.   If you think you might enjoy this game, you sure are my friend."

        "Amazing app! My sister broke my old piano 2 years ago and I gave up. When I started thinking that I need to start again in my piano career, I started looking for piano apps that I could play my own music. Unfortunately, a lot of the apps didn't work for me until I came across this one. Just to say thanks for making this great app. :)",
        "This, after 6 years of playing piano has narrowed all my work down to half the size.. I've been a musical genius, and then tragedy struck, and I lost my ability completely half my life... wasted. But this app helped me to relearn how to play. Thank you. Thank you immensely",
        "This app is so good! I've never had a piano and wanted to learn but couldn't but I started writing my own songs on this app and it's so good. The graphics are like a real piano and I love the magic tiles and everything about this app!!! ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§",
        "Fun to noodle around on, but significant delay when using Bluetooth speakers or headphone (since I haven't this issue with other apps I can only surmise it is exclusive to this app) which isn't great considering wireless audio is quickly becoming the standard.",
        "Its a good app, has many sounds, keyboard is easy to use. All thats missing is a built in metronome to keep tempo",
        "Need more time other than 1 song to give actual feedback..."

        "Cool game and really realistic. I give it a good rating. But can you plz update game sothat more players can join 1 room and plz plz plz plz add more possibility's like feeding cows can give more cows and then you can sell some of your cows and buy new ones. Or you can build a pig stall and buy/sell pigs and upgrade a farm house or build a horse place. Or paint some buildings. I would spread the game to all my friends and people i know if you add some of those things. Plz add some of them cause I really like the game alot.",
        "Good games. Fun.. Need more equipments for farm like oldest planters to newest planter balers drill seeds ects. Need john deere too. Need rid of slurry thing not need it. All need is manure and spreader or just hual manure to make mulchs for fields to cover up dirts and need oldest tractors to newest tractos also",
        "Purchased a bunch of tractors and unlocks and had my account charged only to find the game to block me from using my purchases. This game is a money scam. Do not be tricked into making in app purchases. I even tried contacting giants software to give them a chance to correct but to no surprise i did not recive a response to my email, they got my money why would they care now. Save yourself from being taken by this company!!!!",
        "I have absolutely no qualms about giving 5 stars. It's a nice game. I  hope their updates will give an alternative way to the tilt control of vehicles. It's tiring. Can you also consider faster response to queries to your customer care Department?",
        "Fun game that really passes the time. Only complaints I currently have are:  1. I just bought a new harvestor and there's no \"work\" button so I can harvest my crop. Trying to give it some time because it seems like a glitch. 2. I'd really like to be able to manage animals as well. Like chickens, pigs, goats, etc.  3. It would be nice to be able to store things IN the barn. 4. It'd take the game over the top if you could interact with and customize your house on the farm.",
        "WHERE are half of my purchases??!!?? I know for sure I bought the big red harvester and the bigger mower, tredder, and wind rower yesterday. My first save has them but today its saying their all locked and I have to purchase again... and yesterday I'm pretty sure I got charged for 250k coin package twice and only received coins for 1 purchase. Can you please fix this or I will be forced to contact Google billing to solve this. FYI I have tried the restore button but that doesn't work as well. I gave you guys several days to respond and nothing. So I'm going to have to cancel those charges"

        "I really liked the action scene where the ICE police arrested the mommy and took her children into social services. I do believe giving an emergency C-section for an illegal is a bit much for a story line, but whatever. Totally makes sense. I love how we're able to take care of the premies and foster them until they're adopted! 6/10 - Would play again if bored.",
        "When ever I close it and open again we need to complete all levels again.  Worst",
        "It was realy fun but I think  you should be able to choose what the mom looked like and the babies and choose if you wanted a girl or a boy and choose what teddies you wanted to give them like a rabbit toy or a dog toy but apart from that it was great. Thank you so much.",
        "This game is the worst when you see the picture be for installing it looks okay yeah it has action but it us bad",
        "U did a great job but u should let the player drag the shampoo and stuff to the baby's and mother but good job on the game",
        "Its terrible you can give what she wants gives something else stupidest game i played"

        "It was fun to play earlier but as you reach the higher levels it becomes frustrating it seems like purposely it is not completing the challange ,.. my level is 1629 how much I try it is failed by single ball   ... It looks that they are not having further challanges  but  not agree to accept",
        "I'm about ready to give up on this.  The 'laser' balls introduced around level 1260 are both unplayable and completely pointless. The game is all about popping bubbles, well... it was until this point.   I was hoping to push through to the final levels but as long as these are in the game I really can't be bothered.   Honestly, when I have to guess the best time to launch balls based on totally random evidence... and lose when those balls are gobbled up for reasons I cannot fathom...  Following on... I've reached level 2082 and cannot possibly see how to  get further than about half way through with the balls provided!  I guess if I stick at it for a month or so I might be able to accumulate enough bonus balls to have a chance!  And there I was thinking that 2076 was tough!     And I **still** hate the laser balls!   Been playing for a year now... on the free version... you guys must have earned a motza from all the adverts that I've displayed!!  Update - I think I've found a bug in level 2215 - whenever I launch a ball it is immediately invisible and doesn't seem to have any effect on the balls it's aimed at. Randomly a ball will cause others to drop... sometimes invisible ones will appear as they drop.  I've rebooted the phone... problem still here.",
        "Way too many Ads! As soon as you finish a game Ads , ads, ads!",
        "Very addictive game. Just finished level 2530. I am getting ready to upgrade my phone. Is there any way to capture level data so i can start at my current level on my new phone?",
        "Great for leaving your troubles behind and having fun doing it.  Thanks for making this game free for those or us who would otherwise be unable to play.",
        "It's not fully free. It's designed to make you pay for extra bonuses otherwise it would be very difficult to pass a level. Uninstalling for this reason."

        "By a stroke of luck I got my old game back in February 2018 after a span of a year and a month. Good to be back. A suggestion : why don't you have something like a banking system wherein you can exchange the different currencies in play in the game. There could be a selling price and a purchase price which gives the bank a margin",
        "The movement and the ability to delete structures for refund could be better. Trading HQ could be so much better, my main concern are the loading screens. Perhaps instead of loading the whole city a separate map viewer could be opened that shows general statistics and layout but not the entire city. That way trading could be done faster between cities and there would be more involvement with the trading community. As it stands its a real chore and is deterring me from trading as much as I'd like. Another idea is if the stock market could be integrated somehow. I think that would be cool, and it would add an element of realism.",
        "Thanks for new upgrade . Even when the game was slow i didn't stop playing. I love this game. It's not only a game for me...i am a President of my club and i have to lead my members... in less than one year i reached level 50 and almost all land expanded...just  you have to understand how to play... be smart... some advice for beginners  start participate in mayor competition...this way you will grow faster",
        "Great game. But what I miss are written below.   1. Direct search & contact any city.   2. Invite a city to be friend from within game.   3. Direct private message with a city from within Game.   4. Make a city tagged as favourite city or liked city.   5. Want a clean viewing mode of own city without those construction hats and other info symbols on top of  building being constructed.  I think they are massively missed. And if you can provide these facilities then it will be the best game of it's class.",
        "Addictive & fun.  In a perfect world: more land expansion is needed. Also, variable prices at the GTHC based on scarcity would be better than fixed ones based on difficulty to produce.  One important thing.  There is premium currency in this game.  It's very easy to accidentally spent it, as there is no confirm button on premium currency purchases.  Fix this and will give 5-stars again",
        "I love this game but I want to tell you. You Simcity global HQ building have a problem . And I think all through the world of simcity player face this problem . Your global HQ trade only  View u wanted things like if I want Cement than I searched one HQ building than HQ bulid view me More  And more same thing like burger and sugar and franch FRi and etc things  And few other things like glass and etc I want that the HQ building show one type. Of things like if cement 1 and 2 glass 3 matel 4 cap etc etc than like I want so sir please üòÖ try"

To Nitro 2x points Health and more cars. 5 gas tanks and your either waiting or buying diamonds. What ever it is this game has even more levels . jobs for other charectors. All I now is some of the best old school arcade stand ups with that mobile app. Non stop Rockets and machine Gun blasting with some jams playing in the stereo and little cute pug dogs giving you Xp.

        "This is all I needed: another Criminal Case game to take up my free time! I love the whole four of them. The the hidden objects tease my brain to no end. Each game  is intriguing with an original story line. I do have my favorite crime scenes,  and plenty of friends(all over the world) whom play as often as they can too!",
        "It would be nice if you level up and get full energy but your energy had some if not all left before you got it restored that you just increased by the full amount, the way it is now I lose energy when levelling up because it doesnt add any more to the 110 that is standard. I dont think it is fair to those of us who play daily. I never know when my pet will find that last batch of XP and cause the level up to happen. If I am over the 110 already, I don't even see the new energy. Some concessions need to be made for this. I love the game though, it is fun and challenging.",
        "I love this game. I have all of the criminal case games & love them all. The only things that I don't like is that when when ur energy gets refilled, it only adds to what u have, instead of adding an extra 110 to what u have. The other thing is that u can't buy none of the hamburgers, orange juice, chips or anything with ur tokens",
        "Love Criminal Case and a True Fan!! One thing I think should change is that whatever score you have when you level up, the 110 should be added to it. We deserve it  because we Earned it and the only reward we get is to share juice with other players. Give us a Happy Meal and 110 pts.!!",
        "4th instalment of the Criminal Case games. I love playing them all excellent time wasters intriguing story lines. I'm well & truly hooked on the whole series. Gainsborough, Pacific Bay, Save The World & now this Mysteries Of The Past........ all brilliant",
        "So I completed Grimsborough, Pacific Bay, and World Edition. I was Commissioner with a 3/4 full sticker album, well over 5 million coins, 52 hamburgers, 43 bags of chips, and 7 bottles of o.j.  I followed the prompts and clicked to go to this version. Every time I've transitioned to a new game so far, my progress was maintained. But not now. I'm an officer again with no coins, no history, no stuff, and I can't even watch a few ads to earn energy! I synced with my fb account, and yet it's like I'm starting from scratch! What's the problem here? Or, do you just give up all you earned to start over? Someone please tell me!!!!"

To test is on lvl 1 first corner accelerate and turn left (any set of controls tried all) it will start turning right seems to be when the prospective changes. Looks like it would be good if it went where you tell it to. Might be due to latest patch so will try again if it get fixed",

That would bring back the fast and the furious Season 7 track 6 nexts to be check it says three lap but you are basicly doing lap 2 twice and it says wrong way. Third lap starts when u finish three laps and doing 4th lap counts as 3rd lap. Needs to be looked at this is cheating  u guys are doing",
        "I have a one plus 5T with 8 GB ram still the game hangs at the finish line and all my progress is lost. I have to restart the game to get it going. Please fix this I can sent you the screenshot is you want. I love your game and it would be great if these small thing is fixed swiftly !",

So Infuriating, love the game but that one detail could definitely be optimized better. The drift should not end unless you actually hit and it screws up your direction. 4/5",
        "I love this game and so do all my mates. It dose have a few light glitches as most games do. I would love a night track of some kind in the future but other wise great game all together. Also out of all the drifting games this is the best one at of all of them."

        "I played this a while back and decided to come back and see if anything had changed and it sure did. There have been several updates that I love (the new maps, new sharks, equipment, etc.) and I'm glad I'm playing it now. In game currency price for items has been balanced out which I love and the missions system is much better now. I would highly recommend this game to anyone who likes progression-based time-killing games like Hungry Shark World.",
        "Favourite Shark game in the entire world. I became obsessed because it's so addictive and fun. The graphics are amazing, disappointed when I got my new phone I lost my progress even when I used the smart transfer to transfer the app. I've had to start all over again... but the fun continues!",
        "This game is really addictive and i love it but i own everything now so I don't play anymore. I occasionally get on just to check for new stuff and they do put out new stuff but it takes a long, loooonggggg time. Please put new sharks out and don't make us wait foreverrrr!",
        "It's a fun game and I'm enjoying it. However, I've come from Hungary Shark Evolution and find that the tilt controls in World are vastly inferior to Evolution. Is there a way they can be made more effective? As it stands, I actually have to bend over just to get my shark to swim to the surface. Not fun at all.",
        "This game is amazing! Everyone needs to play this. I would've given a fifth star however you need to not only buy all XXL sharks to unlock the \"!!\" Sharks but max them out. Definitely download this, just one tip. Don't delete when you have progress. I've downloaded, played, got bored, and deleted 3 times. Now I'm never deleting it. I have so much progress, if I never deleted it the first time I would have everything in the game",
        "This is the great shark game I've ever played. Ive also played the other one either this or Evolution, it's good by the way. I enjoy all the time and is addicted to kill the time. But, it's so lag when my internet is on but when offline, is good. Maybe my phone sucks or I don't know why."

Though there are many glitches in the game, this is the second time I'm gonna have to download because it won't open. Overall, it's a fun game when it's not glitching",
        "Garbage game,is now infinitely looping on a challenge tournament. Once I defeat the first opponent the screen goes black and the game freezes. Reopening the game puts me back in the same match and ends in the same endless loop.   Dev team needs to fired and a patrol of lemurs hired instead because they'd at least be entertaining.",
        "As much as I love Beyblade, this app is really disappointing. The gameplay isn't anything special but the worst is the players. There should be a serious punishment for disconnecting. I cannot enjoy the game - I should have won two matches but I got nothing for them because my opponents disconnected the last second. Truly unsatisfying.",
        "Good game but add sprizen s4 and if you could be able  to controle were the beyblade goes and add a swordlauncher when is battle tower stadium cooking out and when is luinor L3  coming and the digital control coming out and if is possible add ring out finish and when theirs a draw that no one gets points instead and some more stadiums more speshol moves for beys but stell love the appüëçüëçüëç",
        "You really don't do anything but press orbs and press to buttons. Plus, just to get cool stuff, you need to go out and buy only beyblade bursts. The game is boring and confusing.",
        "Greatly improved since launch. Achievements are bugged and some Beyblades don't have the correct Bit Beast yet, but most earlier bugs have been fixed. Online play is also a big plus."

        "So nearly perfect. I tried several and they all had too many ads... some (others) with startling loud sounds that you couldn't turn off! Very upsetting! THIS game, however, has only ONE ad at the start of each game, and allows you to mute the sound \"once\" for all future ads. It's simple to click the ad off before the game commences. *wink* The background is lovely and the graphics are wonderful! So relaxing. The happy little \"card dance\" animation after each win is nice, as well. Thank You!",
        "It's a fine enough game, I mean it's solitaire.  However the app refuses to allow Pandora to run in the background unfettered.  I listen to a lot of music, all the time and if this app can't work my life, I can't work with this app.  Also too many adds.  I understand that some one needs to pay for the development and what not... Just make me buy the damn app.",
        "I love this app!  It helps kill time,  keeps your mind occupied and before you know it.  Waiting to see your Doctor seems a few minutes lol. Cons are wish there weren't too many ads. When the ads pop up, it kind of ruins the game. Other than that, great!!!"

The game is like vice city that's good but in vice city their will be boats bit in this game their is no boat, air port , bus ,trucks and people are always firing hero always and fight skills have to improve. The irritation thing is mainly adds when starting or completing the missions. U should remove adds and have to update the game play",

        "Funny It's funny and fun but doesn't quite make sense. He is a rope man....That's like making rope wear underwear and a cape then calling it ROPE HERO!More or less 3 is good for me. ALSO it always says ads if there are ads ppl adept that will ya!",
        "One of the best games I have played on Google play. Or rather it is the best games  Cons: 1. There should be a storyline with this game like a real superhero(and not someone who helps bad guys too)something I found awkward.   2.The area is descent but please add the underground train terminal with some action there too. It will just take the area to a whole new level   3.There are no days and night. No whether change, nothing.   4. Add more fighting style for the protagonist.   5. Please add more buildings and the climbing up is lethargic.   Else it is a great 100 mb game. Keep it up!!!!!! üòé üòé üòé",
        "Major problems with the Rope Hero games. ALL OF THEM. First problem: Leaving the game at all shuts it down completely; any quests you may have been in the middle of, will be dropped. Second: By tapping any of their many ads, you leave the game. Which in turn, shuts it down, and whatever you were in the middle of. Third: there are far too many ads. Anything you do? There will be an ad. Fourth: There are major grammar problems in any speech within the game. This shows a great neglect during the creation of the game."

        "Found a game called \"Infinite Balls\" on my friend's iPhone, we loved it. This is the best Android alternative we could find, but it's not quite as satisfying. Balls are never randomized, there are no circular objects for the balls to bounce off from and neither an infinite mode. Also you  have to get used to the controls. Would be nice to turn off the help lines, too.",
        "Super fun and addicting, the beginning levels are pretty easy but they get to be rather challenging after a while!  The only thing I don't like is the frequency of the ads.  Game itself is great though.",
        "Poor controls, continuous adverts, and blocky poorly created graphics.  This is one of the worst versions of this type of game I have played, there are other better versions out there.",
        "Good game.  Wish I could purchase ad- free version.  Deleted! I turn volume off for a reason, but then volume is forced in ads, which makes turning volume off option pointless.",
        "I found a bug. If u are playing offline and game is over, you choose to watch video ad while internet is off, it gives u the life anyways. Without watching ad. May b your developera forgot to call the reward video function on that UI's onclick () üòÇ. Overall a nice gameplay"

        "Definitely pay to win. When you scroll up or down it thinks you are clicking on something. Stamina is a nightmare as when you reach a high enough level that takes more xp to level up, you can't play for hours as it takes to long to recharge. Should make gems easier to get for non paying players so it is more fair. Other than that pretty good.",
        "One of the few games that I don't mind spending a bit i.e. $10+ every month. Requires team guild effort to achieve stuffs together definitely gives a good feeling. Event is weekly and community is lively. Card's artwork feels like Rage of Bahamut but using matching puzzle style to deal damage. Skills of card matter as well increasing the complexity and fun. Only thing to improve would be cheaper ingame currency to encourage more people to have better decks thus higher activity rates.",
        "It's a lot other games of this type. I haven't been able to find a problem with it yet. Great graphics although the timer is a bit fast when you're looking up connections. If you had a button that the players would push when they couldn't find any more connections, that would be great!",
        "Dont expect any support for this game. I've been locked out and i am still waiting on a resolution, like many here. I've paid money and i know i wont be getting any compensation let alone how long its going to take to fix it.",
        "Number one of the best games I have ever played on my phone. I'm watching ads for bonus experience when sacrificing my cards. And I love the fact of that availability. Especially since it pays them which increases chances of more games like this one. Keep up the great work. Really helping my cognitive development of pattern recognition",
        "Its a match 3, pay to win game with heroes. Its pay to win lootbox style pay to win mechanics enures that unless you are extremely lucky or9 intend to pay alot, you wouldnt win jack. The match 3 RNG can also make the game infuriating, such as when there is little to no matches or the matches are for colors which yohr team doesnt have. However, unlike other match 3 games, it is fun for longer."

        "I'm loving these updates really bring more life to the game. The new car is really fun because it can flip over really easy. Please don't change that. A few suggestions: When you go to winter wonderland you can't go back. Would be cool if car panels would become detached like the hood or the trunk. Adding a police cruiser would be cool too. I like the breakable rear lights on some of the cars. Maybe add deflatable tires? Very good game all in all",
        "This game is fun and entertaining and you can test drive all the vehicles which make it quite cool. Wish there was a camera view which you could zoom out so you can see from a better angle of all those around you. Reversing auto changes the camera. Some times multiple simultaneous button clicks don't work. And I wish they had one of my favourite cars here, the Lamborghini Sesto Elemento",
        "Its a very addictive and also a great time killer would like to see a spoiler selection for the cars. My favirote car is fury. I would like to see a (1963 Ferrari 250 gto WITHOUT smoke stacks) the thing i dont like about the game it is not letting me into the city i bought it and i tried over and over again but its not letting me its gliching a lot and exits me out of the game other than that it is a great game would like to see some new buses and trailers for  the semi's out in test trive mode and a new land area in the mountains.",
        "Need a 67 Shelby mustang gt 500 fastback \"Eleanor\". Also needs a hand brake for sharp turns and drifting and maybe an inside view with steering wheel and stick shift. Very fun and addicting game. Great job here. Multi-player would be cool too.",
        "This game is really fun and additive I play it EVERYDAY. This game is by far the best demolition derby game I,ve  played. For my free car I would like a lykan hypersport please!!! ;-) If you do not know what it is please look it up and please try to make it they are really cool, fast, and exotic cars. If not I would like tank. Thank you for reading.",
        "Cool game! Good grapich! Nice control! Fun Game!  Well, this game need more jumpy track and smaller road for racing. Imagine if you race and the car jumping through the track. Idk why straight maps its not very fun to play. I want downhill track with ultra high jump im sure lot of epic moment will happened there   And jumpy map for derby mode with more obstacles and every maps must have its unique\u200b thing like falling rock or bouncy bomb im sure this will give more fun.  Car? I want the car have accessories like extra headlight, bumper or weapon? 20¬∞ arc ram in front of car will give more fun and and rear mirror and driver POV camera  Well, i want ice cream truck, the officially derby monster truck, hot wheels car and F1? :/"

Without this the game would not be nearly as good as the game play I'd very simple but it would still do ok. However these features are what makes the game. Also the fact that there's a night and day feature gives the game an even bigger opportunity to show the beauty of its art style",
        "Alright, so the game is pretty good. All I ask for is more tricks, and the ability to upgrade some bonuses (coin magnet, feather hover thing, and the third one that I haven't grabbed yet.) All in all, if you could do that, it'd make the game so much greater. Apart from skipping missions and revives there's no use for coins.",
        "First off, I'd like to give a big thank you to the developers for this game. It's amazing.  However, I've been encountering quite a few bugs lately. One day, picking up a hover feather crashed the game. Today, I can't pick up llama horns, and the background blur that happens when you go into the workshop stayed into an actual run. I took this as a challenge and continued playing. I'm on a Samsung Galaxy Tab A 9.7 running Android Marshmallow.  This is just to tip you guys off on some bugs.",
        "Good graphics, but can get boring after only like 3 minutes. Also the makers of the game should add a another different mode where your running away from a villager/camper and see how far you can get. You could improve or modify this mode that i have made if you want",
        "This was the must have game- I think, for a while. Then the newest update came out. Now it has ads you must veiw (before totally optional for more coins or an extra run) and added FTP elements. Took from a 5 star classic, to barely 2 stars. Thankfully, the base game play was untouched, and still well worth the advertisements, but I'm very sad for this move on the part of the dev team.",
        "I have 'noisy' brain and anxiety and sometimes the world is too much to bear. This game keeps me calm and collected all the time. The music and gameplay soothe me up. I do get frustrated over the goals but I have nothing but praise and love for this game. Thank you to everyone involved. You all helped a lot. Cannot wait for Alto's Odyssey for Android!"

The way to fix it is by putting spaces after it. Another example is that the boss customization screen sometimes switches back to boss selection screen and can't go back after being there for long periods of time. I would love to give this game 5 stars if these issues were fixed.",
        "I loved it. I understand the ads are so that you can continue your work. However, there is a few probelms. First of all, when you click on the judgey/uneven eyes, they change to even eyes. Second of all, when you click on a custom character, the game doubles the name, and following along with that, sometimes it undoes it. I understand if it takes a long time, but i'm asking you, if you can, to please fix these when you can. Sorry for bothering you.      Doge is waiting",
        "I'd happily purchase this game but that doesn't seem like an option. Tge ads, especially the LOUD BLOW UP EXPLOSIONS game that go on for 30 seconds are especially annoying. I'll gladly buy it, if only to not deal with Fing ads all the Fing time!!",
        "Too many ads. It's annoying especially when you are connected to the internet. The King Boss is not working and is always saying \"Something went wrong, please try again later\" and crashes the whole gane. On the other hand it's a super addictive and fun game to play.",
        "Game is now unplayable due to ads and KIIP rewards popups. The ads bring up my status bar so I can't X out of the ad, and the app hangs when trying to load the KIIP program. I have no interest in trying to play something that shovels ads in your face more often than you can actually play.",
        "Recent updates have made this guy unplayable. Now you have to wait  through a 24 second ad that keeps reoccurring.  Not fun for kids and worse for their parents. Kids loved it before these updates."

        "This game is the WORST!!! The controls don't work and there is not even demonstration on how to play. Also every time I retried to do it a stupid add came up. I AM FURIUS!!!! Do you expect me to have patience with this game? I hope not because I have no patience and this game totally pushed me to the limit and put me off playing on my tablet. If you do not want to be annoyed please don't get this app and if you do delete it straight away in my opinion. ( I don't mean to be rude but this game makes me very angry.) THE END!!!!!!!!!",
        "Ugh look people if u start playing this game oh wait if u had any sense u wouldn't. these adds are outrageous every time I die there an add I'm not even kidding. My dad rates tones of games and I'm the one playing some of them and I told my dad that these adds are so horrible I even had to report it. Now here me out great game but the adds. And in the beginning there is no instructions on how to do the game so like I said in the beginning there is a add at the end of every round so in the beginning there are many adds. Now i think there are more adds then game in this game. I'm not trying to be mean so don't go cryingüò¢ to ur boss.",
        "I think there is to many ads like u have to watch a ad after u die. And then if u wanna continue u have to watch ANOTHER ad. Its just so annoying. But other wise I love this game. It keeps me entertained while I am bored or when I am on the bus on my way to school. But there are way to many ads and I hope u guys please fix that. üíú",
        "tbh it's a really good app! The only problem is that it gets a little boaring after a while (obviously that's my opinion) And I don't know if it's just me but there or tons of over 30 second ads.",
        "I like this game  very much cause you dont know what comes in front of you which makes this game more interesting. But 1 problem is there that the second i crash to any obstacle an add popups",
        "I really do like this game. It's a good way to learn to think quickly with what side you should move to. Although, it would be even better if you didn't have so many adds, but every rose must have it's thorns and I'd say the adds are this roses thorns."

And also raise thr chance if getting a legendary I played for almost a year and I never got one l. My friend got one all the time on his apple but there Is a glitch with android.ive never had one.",
        "Good, but has some bugs I'm sorry if I'm being too critical in this review but especially on Mobile Data, Smashy Road can lag. This is to the extent the game will no longer work. Moving on to a positive, the graphical interface is very nice, the perspective, movement and background vehicles is very well created.  Very good game overall",
        "It's good but... I enjoy playing this game, there isn't too much skill involved but it's a good way to kill time and it stays easy enough to make it enjoyable while raising the difficulty.  The only thing I want to see is no more of this, automatically backing up stuff. When you are nose first in an object, the game automatically backs you up, but I've lost countless games because it doesn't stop or doesn't back up enough. Let me choose when to back up!",
        "Good but... you can sometimes glich and get trapped but it's a good game anyway like you run from police. Also when you start off you have to press right or left to start so you can't go straight forward when you get on. I really liked it though it is one of my favourite games! I'm out  Later ima go play some Smashy Road now!",
        "Shalom there, The game is awesome. I liked it very much and hoping that in the future they will be more cars to be added. I really hope that \"military helicopter\" can shoot something, it is funny...so idle. Last thing, a HOVERCRAFT can go \"river mode\" ! Wrecked... because of...water. Hope you'll add the \" police boats \" in next update. Overall, abundant of thanks and good luck.",
        "I LOVE THIS GAME. It just need's some work to do. Like, you guys need to fix the glitch of the lines by the road. And you need to fix when we explode the oil truck and fall on the ground and you disapear. And can u guys please add some new prizes like to change the color of ur car. And when I have 100 dollars u can spend it on colors  theirs a button to choose what prize you want. Like say I get the color blue for a red car. And I like the red car so I go to the prize machins and choose to buy a color than I have the button to change the color of ur car. That will make the game a lot better. And I'm sure when u do it there will be more downloads."

Maybe every 40 levels add a mill purchase option. When selling on the market, we need an option for a blind add or a neighborhood only sell or trade.. make these upgrades and so far game would be perfect!",
        "It's great to be able to buy from other farms in theory. But there are WAY too many times that you click on something and it's either sold or not even in the roadside stand at all. The for sale paper needs to update quicker.  Also, it's very hard to accumulate any 'west bucks' in this game and you need them to do almost anything, so the game is a big money suck too. I'm deleting it.",
        "I love these type of games just like hayday. I have noticed it freezes and takes ages to load the newspaper. Also would be helpful if it could tell you who needs help in the newspaper would help filling orders quicker. Also I have noticed alot of people selling the same parts and harder to get others and it's extremely rare to get the land parts without paying",
        "The game doesnt give enough case vs things to buy or fix.  Also have issues with getting product into the alloted spaces.  I thought it was my screen but had it cleaned thoroughly and it still happens.  It takes several attempts!!!  The story is cute.  The graphics are cute as well.  Ive noticed it has a couple of choices from other games Ive played on older phones. I would suggest the game to others but get the issues fixed and itll be a 5star game.",
        "I love playing these games. I'm not sure why we are rating gameplay they offer apps not a game. It's crazy how they ask us to rate game at the beginning of game. We haven't learned the bad points. This game makes us pay for treasure chest instead of giving us to them free like most games. Which means we have to pay for everything. Totally not fair. Takes the fun out of game.",
        "Was totally looking forward to playing this game, the graphics were so cute that I couldnt help but download, but I havent even gotten past the tutorial and its frozen? The game started panning to the billboard right after you sell your first visitor the cream and then it just froze and now it won't let me continue on."

In a couple of the missions I have noticed it has given me 200 passengers to bring to a airplane boat (forgot what its called) and you cannot land a plane big enough for 200 passengers on it! No room to land without the wing getting clipped off by the tower and no place to take off from it! Other than that it is an awesome game",
        "Pretty cool app. I'd like it more the planes/jets could be personalized with personal/or existing airline company names and if you could play commercial type flying modes. All without having to level up or earn money or pay real money for. Like a free fly mode. Oh,oh... and that there was real life situations that happen as a result of no fly zones and stuff. Otherwise it's pretty cool so far.",
        "A really good game to play if your board and have nothing to do. Its proberly one of the best flight simulators on mobile devices ive ever played. The graphics are acctually really good for a mobile game that runs smoothly. The controles can somtimes be wonky but youll get used to it. I love to play this game i really enjoy. The best thing about it is that, its FREE! Good job 'fun games for free' üëèüëåüñí‚ò∫",
        "Was able to start playing right away because of the level of simplicity and yet you have to learn so you can challenge yourself in the more advanced campaigns that soon come up. The game will leave you finding out that a couple of hours has passed in a blink of an eye because of the fun you're having. I really just started the game so I will come back and update this in a few months as I advance in the game.",
        "I've been losing sleep for days now playing this incredible game. Hahaha! Great graphics, smooth controls, realistic sounds, and easy-to-navigate interface. It doesn't force users to pay real money to fully enjoy and access the game. I wish the game offers a first-person mode where you get to play inside the cockpit and navigate the aircraft. That would be so much extra fun! Hats off to the team behind the game's development! :)"

You know Angela have plenty of gold coin even Hanks have three. It's not fair. Lastly good job guys.",
        "Great game, probably best talking animal game out for adults n kids... but sometimes u watch a video so u can spin the wheel n win gems or coins but the wheel not always comes up... ive had approx. 20x it has not happened in last 4 hrs... would like it redeemed n fixed plz...",
        "I like my talking tom and I download this one thinking that it will have some fun stuff like play mini games I know this one have a picture feature but man only eat, pet, sleep , and pics? Sorry I am re-downloading my talking Tom and start from scratch that only take pics feed and sleep on this game",
        "My three year old grand daughter got around my password and charged $40 of in app purchases and did a monthly subscription, too. I have gone through everything to try to remedy this, with no help from the customer service from the this apps developer.",
        "I hate this game when I download it as I came to level 15 hank turns in a kid and looks like a road pup his face üò´üò´üò´üò´ is very. Bad I can,t see his face any more road pups also look good  but hank is üò´üò´üò´ when he is in level 1 to 14 at that time he looks normal but at 15 üò´üò´üò´ all other games.

I'm sure if I had the patience to go through and understand it properly it would be fine, but I didn't want to. Old angry birds setup was better. Wish you didn't change it. Uninstalled after 1 day.",
        "I really think the tower is rigged. 1 in 4 chance of getting the pig but it seems to happen ALL the time. Cant get past the 6th or 7th floor. However if you spend lots o money to buy gems I guess it can be done. Not for me I am out.",
        "Can no longer watch ads to get an extra rewards chest plus, I logged in for 90 days and did not get my legendary chest. My screen froze up when I hit the claim button and had to restart my game. Now my chest is gone and the next level has appeared without me being able to chose what I wanted from the chest.",
        "Caution! Needed access to my personal files including photos to play the game.  I denied and could not start the game unless it had access. Uninstalling after this review.  Don't let programmers and hackers get a hold of your personal files!",
        "Graphics are good, game play can be lame at times when you get birds that are incapable of completing the level. You can't buy the game and that bothers me. I spent $20, (to support the effort) but am trying to keep it at that.  Others have spent $100 and more. Greed ruins this game. Just finished a level that was designed to be beat only by spending money. Spent hours trying but finally paid and beat it. The game play is not consistent. If you have a bad day it will let you win, if you're winning, suddenly an opponent that should never be able to beat you, kicks your ass when you've played perfectly.",
        "It won't let me watch videos. Every time I click on the TV to watch a video for a free bird or arena ticket, it restart the game instead and I lose a life. I hope this gets fixed because other then that it's an addictive game. When the Glitch is fixed I will give a better rating."

Awesomeüòí Not to mention I sometimes just hit a ramp and don't reach the end and fall into a void. Also fix your Poppa Wheelie's handling. You killed it, literally. Just try and fix your game a bit and I will give a 5.",
        "The game is good. There are problems though. D-muscle is absolutely useless. It's the worst car in the muscle set and has no business being the fourth car in that set. The final upgrades for the fourth car on all sets are far too expensive. It requires an insane amount of grinding to unlock the last cars. The prices of supercharged upgrades are all over the place. Why do all of Haulinator's cost 100 coins while Dune It Up's cost 1000-2000?",
        "Horrendous abuse of in game ads like I've never seen before in an app. At some points, you literally cannot proceed until you open the play store. The game races are short balancing acts wherein you simply try to keep your car on its wheels. Do not download, and do not let your kids start playing.",

This obviously frustrates little man and I'm sure I'm not the only one this has happened to. Other than that, we think it's a great game.",

I was very happy when I found something I could upload...THIS GAME. its free and fun. Enjoy playing this! Thanks for reading.",
        "Well, I don't even know how to start the game. First, they show me the starting video. Then I just have 20 coins and I can't do anything except for changing the 2 people's clothes. I would be thankful for anybody who tells me how to start the game. But I really like the mansion's design.",
        "Okay, I guess I mean there isn't a point to this game. you just keep doing the same thing over and over again. It's not the worst thing I played bit defiantly needs some updates, But it isn't that bad of a game. All I can say is try it, if you like it, good for you!",
        "FOR THOSE WHO DOESN'T KNOW HOW TO PLAY: When you get to the homescreen, go to the bottom right and you'll see a play button, press that and it'll start the fun. For those who hate this, why can't you observe closely first before screaming your complaints? Can't you see the game creator worked hard just in order to entertain you and you repay them with complaints on not knowing how to play?What if you created a game and others complain not knowing how to play? Is that nice?(Not to offend) thank you",
        "Disappointed It was cute but its really boring, you get a timer that goes too fast, meaning you can't get things done in time! You don't have control of them, they tell you what to do next so no free will, its not like the sims for kids"

I've never run out of coins so I pretty much get to choose what I do and don't want to do which makes it really easy to heavily sway the odds in my favor. The ads crash a whole lot too which means I have to restart the app quite a bit. Other than that, I like the game",

        "I love this game, i've been landed surface in every celestial object few times, included Sun. I also recommendation to other friends in forum to play it.  But, I want suggest to add some simulation like : - Rotation planet. - Perihelion/Aphelion. - Perigee/Apogee.  And also some feature : - List for delete few space trash like empty booster in orbit. - Name rocket every launch (it make fun & realistic).  Thank You",
        "I am so addicted to this game. I love everything about it. I just wish there was a place to donate to you (developer). Also, I would love it if there were more rocket parts. Also, I wish there was a thermosphere you had to get through to get on planets. All in all, I love it! Can't get enough!  Edit: Thank you so much for the reply. I'm sorry I wasn't clear on the thermosphere part, but i think the reentry effect would be lovely. I just can't stop playing. And I'm SOOOO excited about rovers and things! Thank you so much again! :)",
        "I absolutely love this game, but I keep having a bug where either the close up or the tragectory map goes completely black so I can't see or control what I'm doing. It started  becoming more frequent after a few days and even after uninstalling and downloading again the problem persists. Please fix this! Everything else is amazing: the gameplay, the allowed creativity and the ease with which one can learn new techniques.",
        "Trajectory in orbit I really love this game you made. It would be cool if you could make the rocket face the direction of it's trajectory during orbit. Edit: Can you add re-entry effects when going to other planets? It would be more realistic. Also add heat shields for re entry situations. And when is docking gonna come? Hopefully in the next update. Also, can you add a feature where you can control rockets remotely? It can reduce the weight of the rocket",
        "Very addictive game.  Next version here are some thoughts:  show some flames on re-entry.  Docking clamps so you can put fuel into orbit and pickup additional fuel so you can go to Venus and return to earth.  Put the rest of the planet's in there.  Make it so you can take cargo such as rocket parts to moons and other so you can build a rocket there that can go further due to low gravity at launch.  I really liked this game and a lot could be done with it.",
        "Excellent game, very addictive Would be great if larger rockets could be built though. Also maybe someway of allowing multiple components to be linked to command buttons (i.e) 1 button that could be assigned to all stage 1 separators so they all detatch at once, then another button to ignite all stage 2 rockets, and another button which could be linked to multiple parachutes so they all deploy at once rather than ending up in a crazy spin"

Only 2 suggestions: 1) The final game is boring compared to the rest, and it's annoying I cannot avoid playing one mode and 2) It should be possible to personalize questions with the 4 images, too. One minor issue: it's not possible to change the language of the application. I downloaded it with my default EN language but I use to play it with my family in IT language. Is it possible to fix this issue?",
        "This is a great party game that gives hours of fun. I am unsure why they covered up \"Sargon of Akkad\" from the backs of one of the choice cards since release, I'm guessing that's the bug they fixed?",

        "It's a fun relaxing game. Its so addictive that every device I have, must have this game. I have it on my phone, ipad and tablet. Except my laptop cuz then I would get no work done. About the ads, one pops out each time you finish a game, so I'm not to bothered by it. Also, theres no videos too watch in order to earn coins or diamonds because none are needed. I just love it. Its stress free.",
        "I really enjoy playing this game. It helps me to relax while I am watching TV, or even using in split mode while watching a video or something. It's a bit different then the way I originally used to play Klondike, but still a great game and easy to get used to quickly! I don't mind the 5 second or so ads between games. It's the price you pay to get a good, free game. It's not like they play constantly and during a game there is usually an ad on the bottom screen but it will quickly move if you go to start a new game or need to access the other options.",
        "I would have scored higher except there is suddenly super annoying music being played that there is no option to turn off. The ads also now autoplay loud music. I agree with another poster who said it starting to seem like you lose more so you see more ads. I liked this because it was good for a quick game while getting ready to sleep. The music ruins this. I'm going to try another app now.",
        "I love the game solitaire played it on many different computers over the years. Downloaded three other version on my phone. All of which I deleted almost straight away because they were finicky and I didn't like the format. This one is easy to use and no glitches. So far so good.",
        "It locks up whenever you hit the back key on your Android phone.  Have Samsung note 5 and as I hold it, the back button sometimes gets hit and it asks me if I want to exit the game or cancel.  When I hit cancel, nothing else works, can't move cards or select next 3 cards, except the bottom control buttons do work, so all you can do then is undo, or redeal. But even after an undo or redeal, you still can't play cards, it's unresponsive. All you can do is exit the game and restart to get it responsive again. Too frustrating to use.",
        "Terrible ads. So bad they hid the menu bar behind an ad banner so you click the ads just to access settings. Pretty sure they recently increased losing deal rate to make more ad videos play. So many other solitaire aps available so skip this one."

        "I'm really fond of this game and love the gameplay and quick paced matches. The new update is AMAZING!   There are a few things that would make this game extra perfect for me!   Must have character customisation. This would be of big amazing to me. Char customisation makes me bind more to certain characters. The rings we get don't have much value to them except for upgrading the characters.  Could have non-ranked matches. I would love the option to play/practice against rivals or my own friends.   Should have quick chat responses. Would like to communicate before and after the match with simple reactions. Like Good luck and I win, tee-hee!",
        "This game is if Sonic Dash mixed with Racing. And I LOVE IT!!! One suggestion I have that I don't think many online multiplayer games have, add some sort of singleplayer mode. Otherwise, great game! I like that it's free with ads being removable via in game purchases (which I did), controls, graphics, and soundtrack are outstanding, overall, I love the game, and I look forward to more updates in the future.",
        "Please add a custom character, there is one in the main game so there should be one here to. Also please add infinite, cubot, orbot, and eggman. Also some more variety of music and areas would be good. Thank you for reading and for the great game! :)  (Edit): we need a friending system and to be able to customize our characters so that we have SOMETHING to spend rings on. And Espio needs some serious buffing because right now, he is pathetic.",
        "Until the previous update, everything ran fine. But now, with the Cream update, the game lags a TON. I get frozen on one frame while everything's still happening. I start off in first, then the framerate drops to 0 temporarily while I'm bombarded with obstacles I can't see to do a thing about. Fix these performance issues and I'll put my rating back to 5 stars.",
        "To many ads unless you make some kind of purchase. Loading screens seem to take longer than I'd like. You can't at this time play with friends as Opponents are automatically chosen. There is still some characters ability noise in the game even if you have music and sound off. I'd like to see characters abilities not to be so similar, but it isn't taking away from the game at the moment for me. With all that said though the graphics are great, the game is fun, and it's worth the $1.99 purchase I made.",
        "This is one of the best mobile games I have played I a while. I probobly have a bias sense I love Sonic so much. However, if one thing could be added I would say it should be a converter for the Red Star rings to normal rings. Unless you want them to be payed for. I don't really care either way I'll just buy the Red Star rings but I brought up that idea because I currently have 23,000 rings just kinda waiting to be spent. Maybe incorporate phone backgrounds or some customizations for the game that cost extra rings? Thankyou so much for the new update and if anyone I'd debating on installing it just get it. You'll have fun, trust me."

        "The game is alright, but I  have some frustrations with it. For one, sometimes when you release the ball, the aim will move suddenly and cause it to hit off of your intend target. Also, it isn't cool when you start a new level and you have no available moves (you can't pop any bubbles! ), Sometimes for a number of turns, sometimes in the middle or at the end of the level. Usually it is manageable enough. Still frustrating tho. Maybe it is an international challenge of the game..  Overall a decent game",
        "Uninstalling. The controls are imprecise (ball would slip off the desired direction occasionally) and the order of the colours would make it impossible to win on occasion. I can forgive the first thing (muscle) but making it impossible to win is not forgivable.  Work on the algorithm.",
        "I used to enjoy this game when I had a minute spare. I was cruising at around level 300 enjoy the simplicity of it but not anymore! Since the introduction of the \"ice\" balls, it's become near impossible. Reading the other comment I'm glad to see that others are frustrated with the aim moving right at the last minute. I had this at 5 stars now it's 1.",
        "Games really nice good mind challenge, great for color match making if color blind. You may not know what colors your matching however, ever since i started playing i've also been getting better at matching my clothes and random day to day organising of colored items. Love the game however the ball simetimes seems to go where it wants to instead of where you released it... I noticed this a few times i would aim let go and the line would randomly jump to a new spot and the ball shots almost a completely diffrent location",
        "Tooooooo many adds. ThAt too boring ones. An add after every level is so irritating. Feel like deleting the game. Levels also repetitive",
        "It is a good game but is built to take $$.  There are some levels that will not let you pass without spending $$ which I refuse to do.   I understand the need to make $$, but when it is blatantly built to take money, that is where I have an issue.  I wish I could upload the video of the level this takes place in, then you would understand what I mean. Decent game but sad for the obvious reason for the game."

There are no way of earning diamonds to play the game other than buying them. I'd like to see more ways of earning tickets rather than buying or just waiting for it to regenerate. I'd also love to hear the characters speak.",

The animation is beautiful and smooth and runs well on my phone. Please never change the way this game is. It gives you the option to buy things but it is very fair to those who can't pay due to money issues so I would definitely recommend this game. The developers should be proud of this game because it really is beautiful designed and made you can tell alot of care and effort went into perfecting this game. It's worth the wait on each episode, I love the stats from other players feature and how you can go back for free to see how different choices would of effect the game differently. All round a very professionally well built game 10 out of 10 wish I could give it more stars it deserves more than 5 :D.",

Vikings is not a bad game on itself but I feel cheated when I'm promised something and IronSource does not honor their part of the bargain. IronSource said the Plarium did not verify my completion of the offer, so I won't play it anymore nor try other Plarium content nor IronSource advertised games. The actual content is fine, but the business practices are deplorable.",

        "Too late to join this game. As soon as you lose your newbie protection you become a farm for higher level players, preventing you from progressing. Every morning you find all your resources pillaged and your troops dead or incapacitated. Maybe I'm just in the wrong timezone.",
        "The game has the same problems as the other versions. The events boost strong players which makes the gap in strength larger. The premium items are overpriced. Probably the worst I have seen, there is no protection for your silver. This means stronger players always have a reason to attack someone weaker and there is no protection in place after being successfully attacked.",
        "The game itself is great. Zero complaints there. But the fact that it I am unable to ever log in is infuriating. I've literally been zeroed out because the app won't let me log in... multiple times. It's absolutely ridiculous. Needs to be fixed."

        "Okay, the torpedo issue is a bit better now, we can enjoy this game more. But DD is still OP. Anyway, your next homework is how the ship move. We talk about another player ship that play with us not ship that we drive. Their move is rather like a truck than a ship.  They have to move like our ship,  the stern drift first, right.",
        "DDs are OP as heck, torpedoes detonate meters away from the ship (useless trying to dodge between them) and all ships seem to float like UFOs which makes it very difficult to predict where you need to aim in advance.  I really wnt to like this game and see it become better but currently it has many teething issues.",
        "Great game! Love to play it. Had 1 problem so far. Was playing a battle ship. Was rammed by a destroyer... Had all my guns on him. His ship went OVER mine which meant all my guns were now facing the wrong way. He on the other hand torp'd me to death....",
        "The game is a joke, cuz 1. the time is too short, 2. Maps are tiny, we meet enemies face to face 3. Nothing like the pc version 4. Needs all the ships got on pc version 5. ship turning is picullier to physics. 6. Low exp reward. Much lower.",
        "Good game, perfect for long term play both at home and work. Only complaint is torpedoes are over powered and hit box too large. That's why I give it 3 stars",
        "Very good engaging gameplay. I think destroyers are a bit op. Maybe battleships and cruisers should have aim assistant like destroyers have... Because sometimes it really painful to lose against one pesky destroyer :) or maybe limit them like 2-3 per battle or something. When you see 4 or 5 of them and you are in a battleship then it's no fun :) other than that it's a great game."

        "Great game buuuut. Needs more game modes more powerful, target is more. Take the Nintendo game on the switch (also on wii) Bomberman as inspiration. Improve graphics. Add a game mode in which you have to find as many of something as you can to win. Add heat seeking missile that chases you (and that if hits walls will be destroyed.) Add more hairstyles, let us choose eyebrows, also add a new body type (like giant is one) a realistic one that looks good slimmer and more of a hot than the regular cute u got. Oh yeah and add friending so u can see their stats and profile and also just go into the same game instead of asking them what they are in. Maybe add followers and chatting when not in match also player can choose who joins game and who not. Any way this game is really fun and a great timekiller thx field making BTW if u take on any if these ideas thx and be sure to give me a mention!",
        "Love this game brings back memories. People moaning about the adverts when there isn't even that many! Updating now and hopefully it fixes people being able to walk over my bombs when I block them in, them glitches got quite annoying",
        "LOVE IT! Im drowning in nostalgia for bomber man all over, it's absolutely fantastic. PLEASE release an update for power up crystals though! I'd love to fuse colours to create new crystals or just fuse the diamond cut gems to create even better power ups. It's just gotten to a point where i can't get any better crystal upgrades than what I have, and stagnance can be very boring! Cant wait for future updates üòÅüòÅüòÅ !! See you in the arena online ü§£üëãüëã",
        "Fantastic game but chat should be removed. To much racism, threats and bad language amongst those who like to troll. Quite disgusting really as i know several people who have reported this to the creator(s) and still it continues And hackers, that's a whole different story! Very slow to sort out problems, and when you do, it only lasts a couple of days. Definitely glad i uninstalledüôå ain't worth the hassle.",
        "I hate the new update when your about win then you stupid team mate will lose not cool... to many ads needs works one to stop ads is to go back and play a nother game",
        "This game is the best game ever i hope yall add some more greeting or some new skins and more quest also idk why everyone giving this game a bad review cuz of some lousy hackers when they could always join new room  but keep the good work up!!!!"

        "So I LOVE THIS GAME. I beat it once and had to uninstall it due to space issues. I couldn't find it until now. It is a very nice game controls graphics everything on point. Overall my review is 4 stars. ONLY because it needs more levels as the difficulties aren't extra levels but just harder  versions of those so maybe more levels and islands if possible and more stick warriors and it can even go into the skies or galaxy or so although I don't know if that sounds like too much but more levels. If it had multiplayer (online as optional) also, so u can play offline but if u want multiplayer u get online. I'm not trying to be picky. Such an awesome game finished too quickly.",
        "Great game. Seriously like my fav app. One minor glitch they needed to patch though is that, at least for me, it's not giving me the achievements for the zombie mode. Like I've survived 24 nights but I don't even have the achievements for\"survive 5 nights\". I should have all the achievements unlocked but I don't because some of the zombie achievements I'm not receiving for some reason. But besides that minor annoyance, it really is a sweet app.i used to play the classic version back in the day and I was so happy when I found out they made it into an app. Right now my goal is to win the tournament mode on insaine 100 times, I'm currently at 59. GG!",
        "Its a good game up until you play on anything other than normal. The upper difficulties make it impossible to progress past spartans unless you buy gems and get power ups, smh",
        "I wish there were more commands. Like maybe you could command the miners to garrison while the rest of the troops guard. Also, redesign the swordwrath helmet. It looks like someone spray painted their hair gold and then glued jewels on it. I also wish there could be more types of zombies. The idea of endless is cool but please add the zombies to the campaign.",
        "This is one of the most awesome game of all time and thanks to the creators you can play it on mobile too. But it still lack some awesome components, 1. Add Chaos Empire, 2. Add multiplayer!!! Overall still AWESOME!!!",
        "You know,  its a shame because this is a fantastic game. There is ZERO balancing. The entire game is designed to force you into using gems and micro transactions to get past abnormally difficult gameplay walls."

        "I think that the game is silly yet good!This game does not have another level of playing. I think that the temple ruins and waterfall and the other levels are the same!e but the description given to it is a little too much. The levels do not have anything more than just the same setting. I think that the creator of his game should've made the game in such a way that it has different levels and it helps us to get more bananas or something like that. But overall, the game is pretty good. Good job on the game.üòÅüòÅ",
        "My kids enjoy this game however I think there should be an option where you can use your bananas to skip a challenge as some are quite hard to do. This will make the game better as it's pretty pointless without the challenges  Cheers",
        "I think this game gets hanged easily.!!And my daughter likes this app. But it needs a little new version!! And as I would like to tell my friends also.!! But, this game needs a little change like, Now you can skip the adds ,than not get hanged easily or like that And etc.!!! ThaNks I think you can do better !!",
        "I played this as a kid, now I'm playing this again as an adult and the DEVELOPER SCREAM NEVER FAILS TO MAKE ME GIGGLE. THANK YOU. U GOT MY 5 STARS",
        "Very fun and addicting game. love it. but the graphics could be better and more interesting. It just seems kind of repetitious. There should be better graphics on all levels. But still in all it's a great game!",

        "It's nice game - very nice graphic, very smooth moving - it would be 5 stars. BUT - I payed for levels 13 and 14 , and the game does not allow me to play in random order - it's not possible to play no. 23 without finishing all numbers before. If you are stuck in some number, you cannot go to another one - you MUST BUY hint!!! It means - you PAID for the game, but you MUST PAY again for hint - or you are blocked in PAID  game. It's just not fair.",
        "A lot of Numberlink programs have \"fake\" puzzles - they have multiple solutions unless additional non-standard \"rules\" are followed... which are NEVER fun. This app doesn't do that. These are the real deal, and are VERY satisfying to solve. The price is extremely low for the quantity and quality on offer; I highly recommend this game.",
        "I have now completed a 365 day streak... During this past year of playing this game daily, I've had an idea. What if once you hit a certain amount of streak days you unlock a new something? Like a new pack or flow color? That would be nice so that you are working towards something. :)",
        "I loved flow free from a young age. I've played until 9√ó9 pack but when I reached a certain level,  the game stopped working after that and I've tried over and over again to go in but the game just keeps bring me back to the home screen and keeps stopping. Please fix it. I really want to play the remaining levels and packs",
        "Great game. Keep coming back to it. I find it relaxing solving the puzzles, though it has become super easy! All versions are great. All in all, awesome job! One of my favourites, and works in any situation. Quick break at work, something productive ? Play. Something to do before sleep? Play. Got a few extra mins? Play! Wanna challenge yourself on timed? Play! Haha.",
        "Was a great game until about 48 hours ago. I didn't mind the ads but now after every level I complete there's a video ad. Even then I would deal with it but it closes my music player. So after the ad I have to go to the music player and start it again but then when I switch back to the game I have to relaunch and reselect the level. Gets annoying to have to do after every level"

        "Absolutely amazing game!!! I'm a huge petrol head and this ticks all boxes considering it's a phone game. Love the controls. Personally i use accelerator on right, brake on left and tilt to turn. Feels bang on. Graphics top notch. No need to spend money to progress. Literally one downfall... upgrade costs when you get higher spec cars. Apart from that... GOOD JOB!!!",
        "Good game, good graphics,good sound. I like that it is on going, not like some similar games. I found it fairly easy to get used too. Plenty of choices and cars. I like that you are not constantly forced to spend real money in order to progress. That is a big plus for us game players. Well done all at EA, you have a real winner with this game. I personally am loving playing this game. Update, I have been playing for a few days now, the only drawback I have noticed is, the game takes up a lot of space on my device. Having said that, its so good its worth it. As previously, well done all at EA.",
        "Excellent game! I have no doubt that the game is one of the most perfect games. Everything but one thing. I just ran one race that comes with the actualization and I won around 5k, te first upgrade for the camaro Nascar costs around 130k does that even make sense. In the real life if you spend that money to make a competitive car to win that money... I hope you get my meaning",
        "Well,to start off, game really speaks for itself.Everything is pretty dope. I'm just going to name some things that I'm sure most of the people wants. -Dynamic weather conditions,how amazing snow day on Bathurst would be?Rain,wind,foggy... -Breakable parts, mirrors, spoilers,even wheels,and those should be on the tarmac whole race. -Drift events, I'm just going to say,we all want it. -More hatchbacks definitely,and more cars like its Jeep,or Ford Raptor,and you can add unique cars from movies,etc. -And sprint events,point to point.How fun is that. -More mountains!!! Please. Peace!",
        "I love this game but, I download it several times! And the download process is always stop at 98.8% and not finishing. And its say Download Error please check your connection setting! But my wifi connection is fine.Please help me ASAP i want this game so much",
        "Dear EA, I am not one who usually rights reviews, and usually my reviews are praising it. But, you have caused me to become fustraited, as I need to be doing over 99.4MPH whilst coming out of a corner. I cannot do it in any vehicle that I have, as I can, but my car goes onto the side of the track, causing me to go from 104 to 64 MPH. Otherwise, out is a good game"

Really developer?, ya cant wait a tad longer to stop the game and make us stare at a cat puzzle? The worst. I didnt even play it long enough to appteciate the poor controlls. Shoulda known by the corny name that this was a bad game.",
        "Certainly has some potential if developed a bit more.Only played 1st 2 missions which were over in less than 30 secs considering Its only a small game. The AI is not good nor control system that great. Still be nice to see what looks like improvements after a few updateds. Keeping a lazy eye on this:-)",
        "I can see through the map in several places and the Enemy and the map itself is very Glitchy.   There is an Extremely annoying rooster crowing throughout the entire gameplay and yeah I could just mute it but why? I shouldn't have too!!   Then you can hear when an Enemy sneaks up behind you.  I had an alright time playing it but it's Definitely Not a game you'd wanna spend money on, at least not THIS Version anyway!!",
        "Overall....Great Game, but with Controls of Shooting & Moving around....It's Not Exactly Easy to Around. And when it comes to Movement just in General....my Main Problem, But NOT the Only Problem was the Movement in Exactness of where I'm Trying to Move my Guy (My/the Shooter) just Stinks!! - The Game itself....I Love It!!!",
        "Good game and all but the pictures shown for the view isn't what it seems, and this game has some flaws, such as inaccurate hitmarkers. When an enemy shoots from behind me, for some reason, it points to the front, I almost died one time, pressed medkits, I got back up, and I couldn't turn the camera for the rest of the game. Also, add the guns that are actually in the pictures... :/",
        "Way way way to many ads. If you want to exit, you cant because an ad keeps popping up. After every mission or round an ad pops up. When you want to change a setting, an ad pops up. Could ne great, instead its the definition of a sellout"

Could you add a button that you can press that alows you to make your own custom paint job for any vehicle that would be amazing 3rd. Can you make and road that ends come back into the city at the other side example the road behind the hospital 4th. Could add like 5 houses around the city that you can go into 5th. More vehicles   If you agree with what I have sead in this comment like so the developer can see!",
        "Ok I get it but why do the army kill you for no reason? I like this game because you can do roleplay and I'm a girl and there is girl skins which is amazing but can you start with a girl skin and a boy skin to be fair with the girls  Pls do these. Love your company :-) but can you add a roleplay mode that would be great DO MORE:-) but now on my new tablet it won't let me play it please fix that and reply",
        "Good. However, the apple versioned platform overwhelms us by many advantages: They can earn coins and cash quicker n easier. They get options on what currency they use to purchase things. They get to higher leagues easier. Their weapon description overpasses ours as ours literally gives us damage and capacity whereas theirs comes with fire rate, trait etc.",
        "I love this game. But for the next update, u should give each skin there own special ability. Like the flash and hulk skins. Give the flash super speed, give hulk super strength and etc. So that everyone can get a different type of advantage. Plz make this happen next update also make a goku skin. So u can turn super saiyan. And have other transformation. So can u plz have every skin to have different abilities that match the skin",
        "I have been playing the game for 6 or 5 years and it has been the best game i have played. So, i  think you have to make this game better in the next update.Here r my suggestions 1 make the graphics better. 2 day and night shift. 3police attacks bandit in adventure mode.4 add a clan.  I hope u will add these in the next update.Also too many players that hacked their health so plz fix it.Thx",
        "Well while there is nothing wrong within the game, that being that everything is great, there is one thing that I don't like. This game is full of hackers, and modders who make it so that the others lose their stars, lose what they have earned along with my self included. If you could punish these people in some way to show them that it's not okay to cheat in the game then that would be amazing for the people who ACTUALLY promote the love for this game. Thank you."

        "I wish I could post pictures, but the game is too easy. I beat the first 2 levels both on one attempt. Though I am an experienced geometry dash player. But if I can beat a level first try, not knowing the course at all, that's some easy stuff. I highly recommend geometry dash sub zero though.",
        "I think this game was made because with new levels in original version they added new effects, but the levels were very hard for normal players and they were designed for pro players, so they decided to make easy levels with new effects (like wave...). The goal has been met and this is very good game.",
        "Great fun but needs more levels. I laughed when I saw a review made by an idiot because he said this was a copy of the Impossible Game LOL it's the other way around, dumbass.",
        "I love every Geometry Dash version! And this one might be the best. But my only downfall is that the music, which is freaking awesome,gets ahead of the actual gameplay and I miss my jumps. Plz fix and I'll rate 5 stars! But keep up the good work!",
        "I think this game is going to change your life once you start is going to test you all you know you need to be focused to pass the whole entire thing and make sure you try to get all the coins good luck out there and may the best guy win or woman",
        "Incredible as always. Level design is amazing and the graphics are spot on. However, controls are wanky on mobile and makes a few techniques way harder than they should be. There also should have been more levels."

        "Really good game to sit and relax but would be good if the balls could go faster than 2x speed. If you have high points then it takes a while for every turn to watch them bounce around.",
        "Downloaded this game just to kill some time. It was fun at first but then once I started to play the challenge mode it would not let me see the whole screen during some challenges. So there is no way to win at the challenges that require you finish in a limited number of moves.",
        "Should be an option to lock targeting  and then fire, many shots were messed up from lifting my fingure at a very slight angle.  Also check points should last longer than once. Making one mistake at lvl 190+ and then having to go back to zero was so frustrating it was the main reason i uninstalled.  Terrible shame honestly, the game could have been really fun and is an original idea"

Just have a slight problem, ever since the latest update came out I randomly get booted while in the middle of a battle which causes me to lose all my HP on which ever Superstar I am using. Its getting a little bit annoying, wasn't doing that until it updated. Besides that great game.",
        "The game would be better if it wasn't for the amount of space it requires as most of the time i get the message saying I don't have enough memory to save data. I recommend cloud saving also this game has a really slow/laggy loading time.",
        "I'm returning to this game from switching phones only to come across a major problem within the VS menu.  My players are running low on health so I give them health packs then I chose which team I want to fight only to be told that the team is no longer available  and for some reason my health depletes down to zero without fighting anyone! I repeated the process of giving them health packs and selected another team to fight against and once again it fails and depletes my health. I WANT MY HEALTH PACKS BACK THAT I WORKED SO LONG TO COLLECT!!!",
        "Really enjoy playing. Since the update it's taking forever to open, when it finally does, it isn't showing what prizes I'm competing for. New update, new problems...game automatically closes after a match or 2!?!?",
        "After every match the app close. Which kills my battery and it takes alot of time to defeat a tour. It stops while I'm in a match and I only have 15 first aid kits which I have to use to get the wrestlers health back. I like this game but the glitch irritates me. Please fix or send another update thanks",
        "As a beta tester correspondent for google play store protection service this app fail to work properly due to the fact that the advertising ads they run after every match don't play nor load causing the app to not load properly due to the fact that the advertising ads their running after every match don't play nor load causing the app to not load properly which cause it to crash and be unresponsive"

        "The AI spam SO much! All they do is throw a suriken at you till you die. They won't even let you get up! 2 hits and I die yet I hit them like 10 times! There should be unlimited energy who wants to spend $20 for unlimited energy. Plus the controls are trash.",
        "Such a bad game. Nekki never gets enough of money so they show ads nearly after every fight. You can't earn gems from watching videos as it's never available. Tapjoy offers have been completed, but never awarded. All the weapons gets worser as you level up. Nekki wants you to BUY the good weapons. Bad game. Shadow fight 3 is worser than this one.",
        "Great game, my only problem is that it took a long time grinding for the money you need to buy items. It took me about 5 hours of grinding just to upgrade each weapon/armor, 6 hours to buy new ones. Still a great game, loved the way it's in shadows, making it harder to tell who you are.",
        "Let me just say I don't mind a challenge. But the first boss fight is ridicoulous. You need to be lvl 7 to do anything. I would not have a problem with that but you have to farm survival mode to get lvl 7. No problem right well no there is a problem you get 2 xp for beating survival 2!!!!! And you need 400 this is freaking ridicoulous. Plus when you get lvl 7 he is like a regular oppenent. The difference between 1 lvl should not be this high",
        "The game crashes unexpectedly even in the middle of a fight and when I return the energy I used for the fight when it crashed is already consumed when I didn't even finish it.  It evwn crashes in the middle of a raid =(    The game is good but I hope the crashing is fixed. I restart my phone and it works smoothly after that but I can't have my phone restartung every time I want to play. Please fix this",
        "This game is requires you to spend cash if you wanna get strong or atleast equivalent to the game difficulty scaling. It requires spending more gold or gems rather than actual skills with over priced weapons and gears. The controls are not sensitive and clunky. Overall. Could have been a great game but greedy developers."

        "Game is good as all just dance video games. Daughter enjoyed it until noticed that she had only a few dances then had to wait. There should be at least a shorter time to wait. Or some sort of option to earn more coins. Because 2 videos weren't enough. And one of them didn't work because the connection was lost. Again game was okay as for game play. But not sure its a keeper.",
        "I like it, I use it to exercise and have fun with my sister. Only question I have is: How accurate is the kcal Burned counter? I played for over an hour and I am told I burnt 1,252 KCals. I question the accuracy of this. You update the game often, so can you put in the game somewhere the average calories the song the user is choosing to play burns? That is my biggest concern. Otherwise, no issues. Fun, easy to use. Great way to get exercise in all the while enjoying it with family and friends.",
        "It's fun to do and this game is perfect for me because I love to dance. Dancing is my favorite thing to go when I'm bored. I love the songs and dance moves it's awesome to play and do. Thx for making this game cause now I can do more dancing and dance moves. You guys should download this game for you new people cause it's awesome to learn but in a fun way. So if you suck and don't know how to dance then you should download this game it's perfect for you if you want to know how to do simple but hard dancing moves.",
        "It's a good game overall but the songs that are supposedly meant to be free aren't. I would rate it 5 stars but I can on play 3 songs every 24 hours. I'm trying to workout while doing this but a workout isn't a very good workout if it's only for 6 minutes. Please give us a higher coin  limit and cut the wait time down some. Then and only then will I rate it 5 stars.",
        "Honestly, the game is great. It loads good, has amazing graphics and is easy to play. However the credits situation is absolutely retarded. I feel as if we shouldn't have to wait twenty-four hours to play ONE dance then wait again or pay $2.99 per DAY just to dance. You should at least have a page of good free dances for when someone has nothing to do!",
        "I really enjoyed playing this... Or at least the two songs I was able to play based on the coins that I had. My only criticism so far is that there should be ways to earn coins other than waiting so long for refills, watching ads, or buying coins. This strict control on earning coins doesn't make this a great game to play with a group of friends (though I know that you can buy VIP passes which are valid for a limited amount of time). It would add to the game play (as well as the overall experience of the game) if coins could be earned during the game in power ups or when you get perfect scores. This would give incentive to keep playing, let the games potentially last longer, and add to the competitiveness between players to enhance gaming fun."

        "Honestly, I like this one the most. I like that it keeps the mini games present, but it has a new game style as well. I also love that you can play as the characters, as well as the fact that they now have a backstory! The game itself isnt too difficult, making it a nice game to play at all times. The only thing i dont like is the amount of ads, but it is a new game, and ot needs its funding to stay up and running. Overall, good job Metro! Keep it up! :D",
        "Nice game. I like the concept of rebuilding but this game was meant to kill time, I hope so. Keep adding characters and what we require is a hell lot of mini games so that they may keep coming and coming and coming. I do not intend to harass you but try to add more and more mini games after each update. I'm sure that in the course of  time you may be able to compete with the best games ever created but do not make the game larger than DWTD 2. Add more new locations too otherwise we will not be able to consume the tokens. The game is nice because you do not have to consume money for characters and get them through gifts instead. It is also nice because tokens can be collected easily. Please think about my opinions. I‚ù§ this game.",
        "Brilliant! It is absolutely fantastic! Bit of lag and ads but apart from that it's perfect. Also it's very different from the other dumb ways to day which goes to show how much effort the creator(s) put into making them.They didn't just quickly make a few quick games for the money. No. They put effort. It is amazing. The deaths are funny and the characters are cute and so is the art style. Creator, GREAT JOB!!!",
        "The character models are cute and all, but the games are getting a bit repetitive. WAY too many ads. Like, ridiculously too many. The app forces a couple right after you finish some of the minigames. You have enough to offer us - forcing even more ads on top of that is tiresome. Get rid of them.",
        "Dumb ways to die 3 gets 3 stars. No, seriously, I loved the first 2, but this one is not good. Only 4 minigames, not really different each from another. Remember FASTER FASTER FASTER ? It disappeared (I miss it), and is now ADS ADS ADS. The goal here is just to use money and play as often as you can for ADS ADS ADS. The main thing here ? Minigames ? Nooooo, just getting (or buying) tokens and use them to repair houses (no impact on gameplay). Why would this game be nice ? The graphics are still good. Yes, that's all. Have a nice day. ADS ADS ADS",
        "To be honest, I don't think this game updated at ALL. Dumb ways to die 1 and 2 were GREAT but this one... not so GREAT.  First of all,  there are only for games that you could play.  Second,  it's not as creative as the other ones. And third,  the only good thing about it is that for ME there are no ads.  The list goes on but that's for you to find out and for me to uninstall. üòêüòêüòêüòêüòüüòüüòüüòüüò¢üò≠   Im VERY disappointed"

This was the case even when I had the game on my Galaxy S7 (it's now on my Galaxy J3 Emerge). Switch to a more conventional d-pad & action button config, already!! Otherwise, the game is pretty sweet!! Looks innocent & simple, but it's actually quite challenging. Better controls would help a lot, though!!",
        "This is a great game! It is very fun! The only two things that I did not like were these, No.1  You can not drive the ghost busters car! No.2 The ghost busters song is not playing well you play the game! Other then that it is a great game! I would defiantly upload this game! It is very fun!!! Ghost buster out üòâüí©",
        "You should expand the game by making the existing map bigger, and by adding more maps. Also it would be cool if you added a drop to clear your traps, as there's a drop for everything else. It's a really fun, and addicting game, kind of reminds me of COD Zombies. I think it lacks a little advancement. I hope this game doesn't get lost in the mix like every other game with potential. It gets a little repetitive so by adding some stuff I would give it 5 stars and pay for this game.",
        "This is better for parents who want their kids to experiance the franchise. The game is VERY repetitive. The charicters hold the wand horribly, no origional voice acting or sounds, and below average graphics. Hardcore Ghostbusters fans better pass on this one.",
        "A very basic game where you run around the firehouse catching ghosts with short range blasts from your proton pack.  The ghosts just keep coming, so the challenge is to last as long as you can.    Controls are simple: left side of the screen moves left, right side moves right, and there are two buttons to shoot.  When you fill up your traps, empty them in the containment unit on each floor.  Visual cues remind you what to do.  After collecting enough ghosts, you can upgrade your character.  Fill up all three containment units for a short duration super beam mode.  Upgrades and custom characters don't carry over to future plays. Mainly a cute time waster for little kids that are into the Ghostbusters.",
        "Gets old really fast! And you confuse yourself with the controls as game gets faster. Over all it's not a bad game at all! Just needs some additives to the game, and maybe a directional pad and just 1 shoot button"

        "I think the shooting range should be mechinary the bullet shouldn't be reloaded . It should be going as many as it can. Nice game. Really I don't play games but for cover fire am in love with it. And please there should be no end of it because am playing it. Till I lost my phone. üòÇ",
        "This is very nice game, but problem is all time it's will show the upgrade the card's.. So do some change.. game and graphic are really good.. but card updation is boring, I will give one opinion please change the updation of card's system....... And energy need to play its taken so much time.. So we are not playing these game for long..... Please change some of these problem.... Except the card updation system and energy systems... The game is really challenging. please improve some changes",
        "All good and I've completed all ur levels in 10days. Now I'm awaiting for ur new levels and one more which I'm surprised is that.. I'm expecting some stories to end it. I've understood so far that there are other side people who are building some thing and they r trying to stop us but I have not understood why these 2 group are fighting and who is the leader in my group and theirs too. U need to make some more realistic stories so that we can take it part of action movie.. Thanks otherwise",
        "I am rewriting my review and giving 5 stars for all. One of the rare games where it is possible to play without paying real money. If you want you can pay to proceed faster but not paying doesn't mean that the game will be unplayable. Bravo!",
        "This is my most honest review..Never have I ever played a game truly this fantastic where you literally don't have to spend real money if you could wait 4 hrs for every chest. Gameplay is amazing and then there are events which make the experience even more enthralling. Give this piece a go."

        "A very fun and addictive game. I make bows all day, but it's nice to be able to shoot from my couch at night.  The influence of wind on the arrow is accurate when it comes to drift. A little costly on the upgrades for those that don't buy their way to the top, but all games are that way.",
        "Starts off ok but completely rigged to deplete your coins and to get you to spend money. Bow repairs and inconsistent wind effects among a couple of tactics. Also payed to upgrade my bow and sights and it was gone next time I logged in.",
        "Ok game, but bingo mode is a huge pain.  My shots filled out the opponent's card better than mine.  Stupid way to lose a lot of progress/coins.",
        "Love the game, BUT there's a glitch in chest bow where it locks up for 1 shot, multiple times a day. After you shoot without being able to aim, the bow works normal until the next jam. Looked for a place to submit info for possible fix, BUT game doesn't provide a place for feedback. This is only place to air complaints :(",
        "It's really pathetic that apps like this only allow Facebook login... At least provide Google login too.... Not everyone uses Facebook.... Google should make it mandatory on Google play store apps to provide Google login....",
        "Just started playing a few days ago and never really been good at these style of games  .but this game is very fun and I have already made it to top 70 in my state a lil longer and I'll make my way higher I definitely recommend this game to anyone"

        "The game is alright. Still too early to give it a proper review. Only here to say that the timers are way too long in the early stages of the game. Waiting an hour or four for thirty seconds of gameplay. They need to work on scaling the progression timers. A game like this is okay with long timers in late game when you have more than one thing to keep track of. But for these pay to win games to be profitable it helps to bait the hook a little harder before making you wait hours for more content.",
        "This game is a solid mix of \"clash of clans\" and \"fallout shelter\". Just like COC, you have to learn to let the timers cool off. The long term time investment can be very rewarding. The questing/pvp is also well done considering you can't choose what to attack or when during battle. Wholeheartedly a good game.",
        "GG easy. everyone whining being pay to play this that. i never bought anything and I'm loving this, just need a little patience and you can do many things untill one thing gets done or upgraded. I'm high in ranks, have a clan dedicated to non buyers. its all cool. been over 4 months and i still play this its amazing! great work guys, keep it up and keep adding new stuff.",
        "I love the game.  The thing is, this game just gets boring.  For example,  all you can do right now is to vanquish invasions. That's basically it. The portal is not always open.  The tournament? Well the match ups are way too oblivious.  My in game friends already have started quitting coz of these problems. You have to add something fun soon. Well it is still a fun game tho.",
        "Would be a great game if it wasn't blatantly pay to win.  Everything in the game is designed to push you to pay.  I enjoyed it at first and usually toss about $15 since it was decent.   But then, the system pairs you with opponents you can't defeat which then hampers your progress greatly which then means you either pay or hope you don't get attacked too much and lose all your resources.",
        "Been playing since early access relese. Game is very well built. But like all other games. The ads now bugged. The daily quest for the ad has never worked for me. Starts ad restarts app no credit. Oh well its an ad right. Well now your forcing me to watch them. Please fix So can i atleast finish those 2 daily quest?!?!?!  Also since update my androids menu buttons overlay all buttons on far right/left hand of screen depending on tilt. Phone is an LG stylo 3. Please address and i will rerate later."

        "Loved this game. The game is so addictive and enjoyable. I think the best ever football game to come across. BUT I HAVE ONE PROBLEM WITH THIS GAME. AFTER BUYING COMPETITIVE SQUAD THE GAME BECOMES SO EASY SUCH THAT I WIN BY A MARGIN OF 10 GOALS PER GAME. SO KINDLY, KINDLY.. DEVELOP TWO LEAGUES WHERE TO WIN A GAME SOMEONE MUST SWEAT even if you have all players rated 90%.hope for consideration during next update.",
        "Everything is good. But one thing. I have 6 created players in my team and I don't get new players for 5-6 season. Please make a \"Create a Player\" option under 'My Club' menu with more player editing options with a base rating of 60 or 70. Please add this feature then only I can create players same as the local leage in my region. It'd be so nice if you add that.",
        "I will love it if i can send players on loan and be paid some coins instead of directly selling them off. Also switching players for a few or no coins will be great. Since players like pogba likes changing his hairstyles, it will also be great to effect some changes in some players hairstyle. More leagues are needed, if possible, German,  Chinese, Nigerian and south African league. Lastly, commentators find it difficult to call the name of a created player, work on these and this game will be perfect.  Thanks",
        "DLS is one of the best games on Android. Just need some improvement in training mode, Training is full of bugs. And where is Ball change mode?? Please add new stylish Match Balls. AND PLEASE ADD NEW CELEBRATIONS IN NEW STYLE!! Need more realistic Gameplay. Really hope that you guys fix all small bugs soon. I'll rate 5 Stars!! ‚ù§üëèüëè",
        "Very good game. There are lots of players but Manuel Neuer is missing. Some extra things need to be done for this game to become the top football game. German Clubs and many clubs of other countries like those of Poland, Denmark, etc. are missing. If these clubs are added, then the game becomes complete. Hope this changes are done by the \"First Touch\" as fast as possible.",
        "Great game. I suggest that every team plays each team both home and away like in the Premier League. This makes each season longer and gives you the chance to beat teams that beat you the first time round.  Also, you should be able to bid for players instead of waiting for them to be up for transfer. You can form a dream team better that way, settling on a certain price for a player."

        "Ok, so I will be calm in this review. Whenever I have the same car in a battle with red, we ram each other, but they push me off the map with ease. The main reason why I wrote a review for this game is that you should make the alien levels a little easier. The last level for it is way too hard, you can barely aim at the boss. The controls are hard too. Also can you optimize the game for the Samsung Galaxy tab A?",
        "I would have given this game a higher review than three that I have given it, the problem is that I have noticed a problem when trying to save some money. For me at least when trying to save money through the daily giveaway/present of playing the game everyday it has stolen money from me discreetly whenever I get around the 1000 coin mark sometimes it is one hundred sometimes I have lost 400 with no explanation as to where the money is. It is for this reason that I have lowered my rating. (Besides the disappearing money I enjoyed the game.)",
        "This game is pretty good, for the most part. The only problem is the bots you go upagainst are  way to hard. I can never win. I would have gave them 5 stars but I gave them 4 stars because of the bots. And the game is kinda hard to control. When I move backwords on a veichel it goes up.",
        "Good for killing time. Some of the computer driven opponents seem to have a very decisive advantage at initial start of certain stages, and some of the smaller vehicles are too sensitive on the controls  but overall decent game.",
        "New update stucks a lot and 1st time my mobile hangs a lot due to this game and btry drains faster than ever. plz crt these mistakes to continue njoying this game",
        "This game needs major fixes, on mission mode, I get my reward after completing a level but I can't ever go anywhere after it. So I never get to move on the next level. üòí"

        "Need to stop people from making it impossible to win buy betting so high you can't play because they Jack the bet so high.Not fair to those of us that are trying to play a fair game.They get all most all their chips by basically cheating to rest of us out of ours.           Need to have a section that explains how some of these games are played and the rules.",
        "Pretty much agree with most if not all the nagative reviews. And thanks to a fellow reviewer am switching to zynga poker. The amount of ads is rediculous. Let me just so no to 6 different ads in a row as soon as i log in. Ill be sure to not contact your \"concierge\" and move on to something better. Maybe an app that actually appriciates feedback.",
        "It would be better if they offered more free chips. Rather than bombarding us Every time we log in with there outrageous prices. Also a flush draw Every other hand and usually someone hits. Barely won a hand since the negative review also. Complete B.S game. I agree with all negative reviews here. 4.5 rating? Haha, most reviews are negative.  Done and done.",
        "Worst poker app there is. As soon as you make money it makes you lose no matter your hand. Probably bots. Only bad whole cards win. Play if you want but DO NOT SPEND A CENT ON THIS APP. It's fixed. Che k out you tube for proof. Then the send garbage email to say it's not fixed. Sent to every bad review. Please play a different app anyone.",
        "It appears that I have reached a certain point where my free play is being met with bot resistance. I've gained over ten million in one day and lost it all and more in suck outs. This game is super fun whilst the going is good, but I fear the algorithms are programmed to entice you to pay real money, which of course you'd have to be mental to do once you realise how loaded this game is. Play for free = fun",
        "Platika...I know you said the game was functioning normally in accordance with the rules. I however have several screen shots proving it is not. I would be happy to send them. Still dont know how the rules would dictate a straight beating a flush? Maybe you can enlighten me?"

        "One of the best wwe games.. even better than immortals.. the difficulty level is always fair when competing with online rivals... gaining loot boxes is also perfect and  not very difficult... I obviously made some In app purchases so I could compete well... just wish to open a loot box and get 1 four star wrestler... things would get awesome I don't mind paying for it as well..",
        "I love the game!really entertaing!but i HOPE you ADD THIS WISHLIST!Here's  my wishlist of superstars to this game that will make it even better,FIRST OFF,REY MYSTERIO,HULK HOGAN,THE BOOGEYMAN, SHANE MCMAHON$, AND LAST FOR THE BEST,THE DUDLEYS AND THE DX! (Including  new age outlaws ajd xpac too)and change the shirts of shawn and triple h into the dx shirts PLZ! I mostly think you'll  add these legends for RAW 25 years characters and rey as the royal rumble character!",
        "reliance I bought a real money loot bundle which was for 76 dhs (UAE currency)but I did not get the loot cases. Also checked my loot place but nothing was there and also restarted the game but nothing was there.. Simply wasted money.so after that I deleted the game forever.also the game is having a lot of bugs like game freeze,network issue,sometime showing black screen,etc.",
        "The gameplay and controls are great!!! But it will be better if the themes of each superstar were added. One things that annoys me is that the superstars are rated very oddly....John Cena is rated less than Elias....How can it be so???!!! If the rating system of the game is fixed then definitely a 5 star for this game.",
        "Definitely a good game. Not into always writing reviews but this game calls for it. The only thing which irritates me again and again is the opening of loot cases because no matter when I click I would never get the desired character or thing as it changes the order once I click it so that I end up getting something worthless. The order doesn't change otherwise. So is this just in order to avoid players to gain good characters so that we have to make in app purchases ? Have given it a good rating just because of the actual excellence of the game.",
        "A VERY GOOD GAME. VERY GOOD GRAPHICS. THIS IS THE BEST WWE OR FIGHTING I HAVE EVER PLAYED. ONLY THING IS MANY ATTACKS OF MANY WWE WRESTLER ARE NOT THERE LIKE STING'S SCORPION DEATH DROP AND MANKIND'S DOUBLE ARM DDT"

        "So, this is an awesome, addictive and fun, satisfying game to play and it is really good if you want to become a nail artist. I would of gave it five stars but it is a bit unreal like you can just rub the nail varnish everywhere but it only appears on the nail but that can stop you from being annoyed because it is not as hard as it is in real life and one of my designs didn't go into my album because the game just got stuck and randomly stopped by its self and it went back to my home screen. Also there is too many ads. I am not interested! And you can't cross them off unless you download the app! What point is that?! And I cannot move and make the stickers bigger on match this so I can't complete it. Help! Sort this out!",
        "I actually had this game a long time ago but have not rate this yet. At first all the colours were not unlocked yet so i was pretty disappointed. After a while everthing was unlocked so i was super excited. It doesn't get me board everytime i have different desins to do.",
        "A really nice game which also got me hooked up! Nevertheles, it frequently and automatically shuts down, deleting what was there.....this really broke my litlle sister's heart, even mine. For we were working on one for a long time and after one of thise repetitive ads, the app shut down.....",
        "Its the BEST game I EVER played! Also, when I was 4, we didnt unlock anything. Now I am 17 and we have every thing for free! I love glitchs. Dont try to fix them though!  I love them and u sould 2. Peace out!",
        "I  am finally at the final last level! Before I thought it was boring but after I reached some levels farther I thought it was awesome! And it is the best game ever! YEAH!!!!!!!!üòòüòòüòòüòòüòòüòòüòòüòòüòòüíôüíôüíöüíöüíõüíõüíúüíúüíóüíó‚ù§‚ù§ AND when I was playing my 1st game all things were opened but when I played in my small sister's tab all, things were closed! I got everything for free!! HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA",
        "Buyer beware, I purchased the \"unlock all manicures\" option less than a year ago, not only to unlock options but also to remove Ads for my kids. It's less than a year later, and ads are back, with an option to remove them for another fee. When paying just about 8 bucks less than a year ago, I find this distasteful. At least give a full year of ad free gameplay. Not impressed."

        "This game is a game I can proudly say I will never delete. I hadn't played this game for very long but I have loved it so much. The game is incredibly fast paced so you can play up to about 4 games in 10 minutes. It's never boring and always keeps you on your toes. Both sides are fun. (I feel the sniper needs a buff but this is just my opinion). Other than that small compliant  I love this game.",
        "Its greedy from the developer to make bigger price of silver and other chests every time when i get close enough to amout of gold needed for buying it. First the price of silver chest was 80 then when i got 60gold price gone to 110 then when i had 90 gold it got up to 130 its like they are pushing me to spend money and i never did that. Good game but so greedy that it deservs one star!!!!",
        "It was very fun testing the early access! And the thing that i noticed was the new token system. Im not saying the token system was bad, but i liked the older system better. On how there were bronze, silver, and gold stars, and the star depended how good the item was. I was wondering why you changed it. –±–ª–∞–≥–æ–¥–∞—Ä—è!",
        "This game has been amazing since early-access. I  have loved it for a long time and will still love it for a long time. One suggestion though. It would be cool if one could emote inside the van once you have got away or have been arrested",
        "Excellent game. Highly replayable. Fun and challenging. My only issue is that emotes switch from one side to the other when playing as a thief vs playing as a sniper. Plus, having to hit a button to fire vs just hitting the right side of the screen is a bit more difficult. Otherwise, almost perfect game.",
        "WARNING: YOU WILL BE HOOKED AS SOON AS YOU START THE GAME. The game is really cool, I love the gadgets, the replayability, variety of maps, and how this could be free to play. Even though there are alot of glitches, these improvements will make up for them"

        "My favorite puzzle/physics app. After I reached my goal of 3 stars on all the levels, I was sad my conquest was over. Then I discovered a whole other area of the app that consists of user created levels to solve. Now I've got new puzzles everyday thanks to the active fans in the brain-it-on community and I submit my own levels on occasion by using the level editor. If you like solving puzzles this is a great way to escape for awhile and exercise your brain at the same time.",
        "I introduced this game to my 8 year old and my husband. We are all hooked! I am fascinated by the concept and simple yet brilliant design. The forced 30 second ads that another reviewer mentioned are only if you want a hint. The between-round ads are short and intermittent.",
        "LOVE this game!! Literally, I don't think I can explain it. Just play it, and see for yourself :D    If you like figuring stuff & puzzles out, this is totally for you! And also, it's just so satisfying to watch. I personally play lots of the puzzles over & over again, just to see the graphics, how all the objects fly and move üòú",
        "Calling this a physics game is a joke. Sure, it has a physics engine that handles things like acceleration, \"mass\" and magnetism... But it's really just a very limited drawing game. Want to draw a ramp because it would lead to the most elegant solution? Sorry, can't... Because your \"pencil\" is too thick and the ball just hits the base of the ramp and bounces off. Know a simple solution? Well, have fun drawing it fifteen times while you get the exact dimensions needed in a very inexact system. I really think there are far better games to practice problem solving that don't get in your way as much as this one.",
        "this game is so simple but yet so challenging. some levels seem impossible but the great thing is you can still advance as long as you have enough points. very well done. hats off to the designer. the physics are coded perfect as well for gravity friction inertia and sometimes extra bounce..  love it. can only handle it in bursts of play because it works your brain so intensely. havent used the hints either though. if you dont keep coming back to play this then you probably arent a very interesting person and spend too much time diddling your privates",
        "A good sign of high intelligence would be to not pay for this.   On a tablet with a pen,  this probably works a little better but on a phone with 1 minute ads,   it's really frustrating.   Basically,  you find a solution and have to repeat it 30 times until the dull and unrealistic physics of this program finally accept it."

        "Um, Its a cute game. It is an.okay game to play. But certain thing can be change. When its festival time you can only play one task at a time. I think that stupid because sometimes you don't have all the ingredients or spices for a task you have chosen, but you ended up having other ingredients for another task. But the only way , you can choose that other task if you quit your current one in which you have work hard and also you loose 50 diamond's for that. Not fair because diamonds are not easy to find. There a lot more i dislike about it. I only play because its a distraction sometimes. A lot of people has left playing the game and i can see why Because at times,  it can be very boring. But there's a lot of things i think can be improved.",
        "When u feel like playing a relaxing game that's not so intense this game is perfect. There are waiters doing it for u and all u have to do is install coffee machines and talk to your customers. Personally to some people this game might be boring but I really love it",
        "I think this is a great game in general, good graphics and gameplay. However I always have difficulties trying to purchase the gifts, like it will take very long to process the transaction. Is the developer able to do anything about it? It will be greatly appreciated.",
        "I would give this game five stars, but I was on level 8, going at a good pace, and the game restarted, taking me back to the start of level 7! Completely frustrated with this. Made all that time I spent on getting to the next level worthless.",
        "I love this game,  but it could use a few things. Developers should make it so you can tell when neighbors are on, how long  they have been on. There should be a better way to help neighbors at festival, also when you cafe staff  uses the upgraded machines you should be able to collect rubies. Many of us spend a lot of money to  play you game and a lot of children play and don't have money for upgrades, buy diamonds or gifts so while we make you rich,  make us rich while playing your game",
        "I only gave it a 4 star for now. The reason being is I like this game so far but could be better. There should be an easier way to get more diamonds than one at a time from the TV. Plus I think the spices shouldnt cost diamonds they should be coins. Plus you should make it to where all of the items you are needing for your cafe should be cheaper. It takes too long to make enough money just to buy one item and then you lose customer satisfaction which makes you lose profit. If you improve on these things then I would be happy to give a better review."

I came acrossed this one from a Facebook add and as soon as I started playying it has been super fun every since. The p2w ratio is literally not high at all. So F2P can definitely gain just ad much. Awesome gameplay good graphics for the game itself overall I definitely recommend this game. ‚ô°",
        "This is one of the best rpgs out there in my opinion for a few reasons the graphics are very nice, rpgs whos graphics try to get really realistic are just not the same it looks blan likr that. My next reason is it isnt a pay to win game. For all of the people out there who like to pay a lot of money, its just dum. Money for a game should only be for cosmetic items to make you look really cool not to boost you 10 tens ahead of everyone, and for that I thank you Allstar gaming. Paying does get you a boost in game its just not very big the only reason rating s are so bad is cuz the top up didnt give them anything which is a huge bug.",

Not to mention we payers get harassed in game by free to play players daily! Show some respect to the people who give you a pay check.",

        "I would have bought the ad free Version eventually, but it was so annoying even to get used to the game, that I gave up. If you want more people to buy the game you have to give them the opportunity to play without being interrupted every death. Your game can be the best ever but still no one will play it if they have to invest the same time in watching ads that they invest in playing the game.",
        "Game is good. Ads are bloody appalling. I have to waste 30 seconds each time I die? No thank you",
        "Alright if you like ads more than gameplay. Stuck with 30 second ads after 20 secs of play. Don't mind some ads, but this is overkill. Pass.",
        "Edit: Ruined it because if the ads. I understand why you have them, but I was willing to watch them IF I felt like doing another round or not. Having the choice to watch one or not was nice. Now you're just forced to after death. Sorry, that's never a good idea. And no, save your copy pasted response, I don't want it. It's not genuine, and it's just a plead for us to buy the ad removal thing.  Original: The core gameplay loop is cool. It's fun, I'll keep booting it up. But it would benefit greatly by a better tutorial. As someone else said before, the ball tends to fly off and lose momentum in ways I can't seem to figure out. Might be a failing on my part, but at times it feels like gravity changes the rules at random and I'm left floating hopelessly as the void swallows me up. I'm not really sure what the optimal way to survive is",
        "It's a great game, for users complaining about ads, it's called ad blocker. When devs force a billion ads and make it unplayable, I use adaway, game is great after, but without adaway, don't bother!",
        "The game itself is a lot of fun, it's challenging and addictive but with ads this game is a nightmare, they massively hinder your ability to progress and learn the game which is very frustrating. I made the in app purchase to remove the ads and without them the game is flawless. I think if the ads were reworked to be slightly less regular (i.e. not every time you lose) more people would be able to appreciate the game and might be more inclined to make the in aop purchase to remove them rather than getting annoyed at them before they've had a chance to enjoy the game."

Can you add multiplayer please  3. Add a few more mini games  4. That the hospital can expand with every level up",

But it  sometimes takes me out and back to my home screen , I think it a good game when I am bord I can play it and the other ones. I think it should use a little work so mines don't lag and take me out of it  after all it is great and fun I love it so much that I wish it will not take me out the game because it makes me sad a lot but I will not delete it because I like it. I will give it 5 Stars but it lags a lot. Wish you a have a fun time playing.",
        "I liked it but the nurse o no! She is so irritating u can't even control the nurse she always stands between u and never moves and the 2 nurse is always in the bathroom And in one time u have so many patients u can't even hold but if u like then ok",
        "Love it but It needs a lot of work like for instance the screen is sometimes small but I really do love the game it's like very special and how you can like teach little kids about hospitals and stuff I like your expertise Playmobil and that is the end of my paragraph peace out  homies",
        "Its a really good game but I have a few improvements firstly the first nurse I ever unlocked went straight to the bathroom and won't move so I think she's there for ever secondly nurses don't really do anything they just pretend to do something also its always the person in the same bed can't you have some variety? Finally the person at the door I can't actually get to...? I know this comment must be frustrating I'm trying not to be to pick but I think its for the best :-)"

        "Easily my favourite android game. Hits all the right spots. While Blitz followed the runner style coins model and see how much you can travel, I am glad that in this game they ditched that over-used android model. I appreciate there vision, it's a complete different game from Blitz. Various fictional cars and characters that seem original inspirations and charming in their own way. The tracks have a theme. Boss races under every championship. There is so much of soul in the game. And you can adjust resolution, add colour correction, adjust many other effects. Words don't do justice here nor does 5/5.",
        "Amazing! I play this game daily and I never got bored. Just one thing: other drivers don't use special abilities which does not makes it challenging. Now since I have completed this game once, I would expect devs to add new levels and characters. I have an idea for a new character. Please contact me",
        "The controls take some getting used to. But for a Mario-Kart-like experience for mobile, this game gets my #1 rating. Feels more like Diddy Kong racing to be honest though. Can be played when you only have enough a few minutes, or grinded for awhile until you run out of tickets.",
        "Imagine Mario Kart but on mobile with a few tweaks. That's what this game is and what a great game it is. So much variety and features that makes this game unique. Vector Unit  did an excellent job and this game deserves some credit for how great it is. I'm telling you, if you like Mario Kart, Crash Racing, Sonic All Stars or even Angry Birds Go, you're gonna love this game.",
        "The game just restarted as if I never played it. Just went through the tutorial as a new player. I have been playing for months. Not sure what happened! Can't sync it with google games. I do know I was playing and mid game my phone battery died. I recharged it and went to the game and went default on me.",
        "Second Beach Buggy game, this one you race opponents with some fun, but dirty tricks. A lot of reviews are unfair, just need to figure out strategies. Needs a few new tracks to update it a bit! I cleared it out 4 times & started over, love it! Played everyday for over a year, great fun. Needs a sequel, hope they didn't give up, there is no updates on their site. BBR-2, yea baby!"

        "Cute game, but not without it's flaws. I forgot the reasons I deleted the game in the past, but remember them now. It drains your battery, the life refresh time is high (20 minutes) and starting at a certain level (30) you really can't progress WITHOUT friends (this is not a positive for everyone. I personally don't like it), or money, or a ton of patience. You need keys to progress. You can either buy, ask friends, or play for one every FOUR HOURS. This is the exact point where I uninstalled the game last time.",
        "I would taste this game higher if the only way you could progress wasn't by having to purchase extras. Having to waste all my extras to get through a gate with 3 keys sucks and so does knowing that really the only way through is to buy your way through.",
        "I'm uninstalling game! I was really happy with game when I started,  now there is an ad every next life and sometimes more! Same ad over and over, enough to drive you CRAZY! Also you can't answer quick text or do anything off screen without the game totally rebooting,  it's supposed to be relaxing to play on phone,  NOT IRRITATING!",
        "I would give this 5 stars, if you could select a level of difficulty, like easy, medium and hard.  It is not relaxing at all, once you pass the early levels. I hate the levels with bullies, you should be able to skip them.",
        "Was great at first, but is now so slow that it takes around five minutes to load the next level - or just to return to replay a failed level. Shame, as I've stopped playing it because of this fault.",
        "Why bother having an X on the Level Rush notification if it doesn't work so you have to press Begin and wait for the animation to finish before you can carry on with claiming the Daily Challenge. Also 'play with friends' on the tournament never does anything. Otherwise fun."

By this time you will have poured hours into it, so I do not think it is unreasonable. Save your gold until later levels (player level 15+) and you can get by without in game purchases for quite a while.",
        "I absolutely love this game. Turn based tactics are one of my favourite types of games. Since playing the game more I've decided that there's not enough gas for me to be able to enjoy the game like I want to. I think the car should either hold more, or gas should be easier to get. This is just a game that already has inconsistencies with reality. Otherwise I love the game",
        "Just loved it... I am at council level 18 now... Weapon upgrade xp cost should be reduced or just remove workshop. No use of WORKSHOP with such high xp cost because its REASONABLE to upgrade your SURVIVOR than their WEAPONS.... Please for next update reduce weapon upgrade cost....",
        "Great game, been playing for five months now and have managed to get all but 5 hero's unlocked. Lots of chances to save up radios for hero calls and love the different types of game especially the guild.  Haven't spent a penny on it and don't think you need to if you have a little patience and use your resources wisely.",
        "I have this game, and I play this more than watching the actual show. You can bring together a motley crew of survivors for missions and get gear to make them stronger. Build a camp, in order to multiply resources, because you will need them to improve other buildings. Also, to note, this game will not allow you to get stronger unless you improve your camp. I have survivors who cannot level up until I Improve the council. The training grounds will not be built any further unless you improve the council. Its like a city/fort building game with tactical rpg feel to it.  There is a leaderboard, that actually awards you for being at a certain tier. You can join guilds to help get better gear. I love this game!  ...The con that I have with this is that every time of logging on, deals are thrown in my face, and it is enticing too.",
        "I've been playing this game for two years now and I can never put it down. It's such an amazing game. I'd like it even more though if the characters we originally fell in love with were available. Like Andrea, T-Dog, Lori, etc."

The cloths aren't that bad, but they can be a little more pretty. They should make it for boys and girls, so you can dress up boys, and maybe the boys can take a girl on a date so, they could get married and then they can have children but, it would be a life cycle! They would start out as babies and grow on and get married!!! Hope you like my feedback!! P.S. Plz update the game!!!",

The actual game itself is amazing despite having a hard time trying to beat the bacteria level but, what's the point of a good game concept, if the game won't work properly",
        "I thought the new scenario was a free-trial only like the simian flu. (At least you can unlock it after being a brutal pro at the game) I'm gonna enjoy playing this a good few times and unlock even MORE scenarios. Keep up the good work! I wanted to make a suggestion, but I just can't remember now. Oh well...",
        "The game is addictive but when you get to a certain point the cure kicks in and it stops giving away DNA points and it makes it hard to advance in the game. I have read the hints in the news it gives, but I still can't manage to beat the game. I want to delete the game. Butim going to continue to try. I just wanted to mention it idk if its the game or just me. I won't tell others about the game only because its frustrating to play. These games are not good for people to play that has any type of mental issue unless they want to buy a new phone.",
        "Fun game. I wish the rate of death was more consistent. 37,000,000 a day at one point, but waiting 6 months for 100,000 to die towards the end. The disease didn't change, the rate of death shouldn't decrease just because there are fewer people. Good game otherwise",
        "From beginning to end I've been pleasantly surprised and let down but mainly let down. I was all for this game when it came out but now you wanna make a quick buck on a scenario app... pay more for something that should be part of the game. Overall good game business practices not so much.",
        "I didn't buy the new plague, i might need to. The first 2 difficulty settings are easy, the 3rd not so much. Good game to me! Just have to read what it is that you spend your DNA points on and you should do just fine"

        "Lost another These constant updates caused me to uninstall this. Fun game - very good game!But if it ain't broke don't fix it. I will not sacrifice all the other good games I have for this single one. Now with google only allowing so many apps ( no writing to sd card). Atleast if you update you should let people keep playing with version they have. Make updates optional.",
        "It's a fun game. If you're a COD player you'll love it. In general It does good on it's own as a solid shooter. Only thing I think you really, REALLY need to change is the way to get weapons. Using rentals is great, picking up enemy or ally weapons, sure, but having to spend money to get most weapons, if not all, seems a little unfair. It's good that there's a grind to get them but I think it's a little overkill how difficult it is. I think levels should determine what you unlock, then use silver (make it easier to get) to purchase it. Or, if players want to speed up the process, use gold.",
        "I really like the game. Fun, exciting, and addictive. The only problem I have is that the rewards you get are not nearly enough as I think they should be. Exp gains are good, but cash gains are so bad and you will have to play for hours to accumulate cash and then you can buy HALF of a weapon, because they require a lot of cash to get one. You also can barely upgrade weapons without any gold and you can just forget about that unless you put some real world currency in this game, which is a real shame. As a player I know we would like to buy and upgrade our own weapons instead of having to \"rent\" which is an option in the game.",
        "Do not install this game! It is broken! For start the spawning doesnt work. You can spawn behind people, in front of people and inside of people who are your enemies. Second is the complete unbalance between premium and standard weapons. You can hit someone with a standard shotgun at close range three times and not kill them. They will then one shot you wherever they hit with a sniper. Dont waste your time people!",
        "Great game play, Great graphic, but after 1 month, I think this is another pay to win game ; the great Gun need to buy,  the Armor need to buy, almost every wining key things need to buy. But some people really like it because they have money to buy all those and \"WIN\" other pool guy. it is not about skill, it is about money.",
        "Awesome graphics, and for what you get on a phone, it really is an amazing game. The only complaint (if you can even call it that) I have is the controls can be a little tricky as sometimes when you're trying to swing left or right you can accidentally change your weapon instead of swing to either side. Aside from that, tremendous gameplay, multiple modes to play, amazing graphics, really just an awesome game. Make sure you have a really good internet connection."

        "It's like Cooking Mama from the Wii, but you don't have to be accurate at all. There are SO many ads. I mean... They send you an ad like every 30 seconds or so! It's a lot. Good game four a you get crowd I think I because it's not really a strategy cooking game where you have to time manage and things. It had a decorating feature that I think kids would enjoy. Also, with that feature, a tablet would be better. Or if on a mobile, a stylis.",
        "Most of the things r automatic so I rate it 3 or 4 stars. Pls guys pls,pls I want u to make it nonautomatic so that we can play it properly .that's all I want to say about this game and most and things are locked these r the two things which I did not like about this game. So guys pls make it properly. Then I will rate it 5 stars for sure. One of the best game I have ever played. Thank u so much",
        "Good game but too many things locked and that makes it 3 star from 5 star. Please coco tab tale unlock the whole game. In competitions always I am third because things are locked. You know money is very precious can't spend on a game. Please please please please unlock things. Ok bakeries we will do but others you. And yes when I have not reached that bakery then the orders come in which they can be completed in other bakery only?üòüüòû",
        "Nice game... everyone who love cooking should download it. But there is only one problem that the things which are the main are locked and we have to pay the real money or watch s 40 ad. For ex:- In the doll cake we don't have the doll so how are we going to bake it.Please fix this problem, otherwise the game is nice.",
        "At first, I was pleasantly suprised this came from TabTales. The lack of pay walls at the beginning is wonderful for their games. Though I'm not very creative, the game demands it for making food. The graphics look great, gameplay is realistic. I was sad to see a paywal at the princess cake though. If you have 10 dollars and a young girl who loves to cook and bake, by all means buy it for her.",
        "This game is awesome!!!! It makes me go hungry every time I play it!!! The graphics are awesome and very realistic. I luv the fact that it is automatic so you don't have to waste your time in perfection... Please keep it automatic like this forever. P.S, for those who are worried about unlocking other stuff like the princess cake, etc. Well, don't be, you will get a chance to play it when you unlock the other new bakeries and when you also compete in the competitions.... üòâ"

        "Definitely a game for car buffs. It requires using your \"mind\" to win. I'm not to sure about my rating yet. But, will definitely change if needed. It's unlike any game I've played & I like it! Someone wrote a review that this is a lazy person's game... LMA√ò, I wish they would show me the games they play while they are running, swimming & mountain climbing \"while\" they play, smh HAHA!",
        "First download crashed and wouldn't load. Had to reinstall the game and Hutch games couldn't recover my profile so had to start again from scratch. I've played through several updates and fixes but the same issues remain, car X beats car y when it shouldnt. Hutch in game support agree there is a problem and send to devs but nothing gets fixed. The whole game seems flawed. To be competitive to you will have to spend about ¬£50 a month. I enjoy the premise but the game is poorly executed.",
        "I love the concept and it's been great to see how far this game has come, but I've been playing since beta and nearly every update wipes my save data and forces me to restart. Luckily, I don't get too far into the game each time, but it is frustrating and enough of a buzz kill for me to drop two stars. If there was a cloud system implemented for saves this game would be a five star in my book",
        "Incredible game. Awesome concept. Two complaints to developers. High speed loop-when you win, it starts detracting points. And also certain mph based drag races,I run out of road but the challenging car gets like 60 miles of road. Besides these, fantastic game.",
        "Followed your advice exactly same as before it doesn't reset to my previous stats back at the start of the game. It's been 2 weeks now and still nothing so I will no longer be playing which is a shame because it was a good game",
        "I think this game is amazing! And is perfectly good in every way!! I can't stop playing and look forward to getting new cars. There is just one tiny error that bugs me a bit but I can cope with it. The error is the color of the Ford fiesta xr2. When you race someone else and they have this vehicle on the card the car is black with a tiny red trim on the side but when it's on the track it is completely red. I do hope you can will fix this small mistake but apart from that this game is great!!! Thanks for reading :)"

There's ads constantly, any time you resume playing from the screen going to sleep, or if you wreck there's one right across the middle of the screen!  Every time it connects to the server, it takes whole minutes to load. Sometimes I set my phone down, the screen goes to sleep and then i have to watch another ad! If I was waiting for it to load an ad in the first place, I have to watch that one first, then a second one as punishment for the screen time out. üòíüòí Not cool Loading times plus ad videos constantly, equates to more than time spent playing.

Bugs: Pineapples that give you coins don't register as pineapple hits for the counters. There's a glitch where the fruit jumps to the opposite side of the screen. Graphics bite the big one though.. fix it",
        "Fun and addictive but... Very fun and addictive game except for the fact that it takes approximately 60.56 MB... an app this small (but still amazing) shouldnt consume that much of my space. Unless you have more items in the games files which will be soon added, but if its not that than Im... puzzled.",
        "Addictive  I play this game everyday when I wake up. I find it flawless, I have had no problems with this game, not even adds! The only thing I dislike is the title ( it did not effect my rate), why is it only pineapple pen? What happens to apple pen and PPAP? Anyway I love the modes and pens ( the surfboard is my fav pen) one again they are flawless. I think that Ketchapp is pure genius.",
        "Its good but nobody is changing the theme. Back to normal. Its still christmas. It seems like an abandoned game yet i think it was pretty popular among non ketchapp game players. If ur not going to keep up with the changing theme at least put it back to regular n take it off holiday.",
        "The games controls,  features,  graphic are really good and can't get your eyes off the screen once dart playing BUT, They are advertising companies that pop up there add moment we open the app... And whenever huge pineapple is on the move these things pop up please patch this immediately.",
        "BEST GAME EVER!!! (one of the best games ever) it doesn't have any adds which is great! Love all the different types of pineapples & apples. What's bad about this game? Nothing. Which is good especially for me because I'm not that patient. I would recommend that you should have this game."

What i mean by that is, almost all of the items are being sold by gold tickets (which i cant top-up) . please add more items that can be bought by silver coins.. I have like 16.5k on my acc and i have nthing to buy... Please read this and make this possible ..if possible thankyou..!",
        "It's a good fun game. Just having issues on the Galaxy J3 Prime in terms of the main menu screen. I'm not able to do any sort of action on the main screen. It will not show my character nor any other character when match making. Really bad update that was released just recently. Please fix soon! Leisure mode is pretty much all i can play because of this error.",
        "The game is not loading after connecting 100% page 1st edit - Is it just me or others too are facing this problem? Is this problem going to be sorted? 2nd edit - Problem persists, reduced rating from 4 to 3..... 3rd edit - problem remains unsolved 4th edit - reduced rating to 2... problem continues 5th edit - got the latest update but still the same problem continues 6th edit - the game loading advanced a bit but gets stuck after loading 72% (after server selection page) 7th edit - still stuck at 72%, phone memory is good, network is good....",
        "Soo many glitches.  1) items are not getting picked up. 2) automatically transfer me to places I been before. 3) sometimes i just die before i even touch the ground. 4) keep teleporting me away from my target  area. Sooo disappointed.. there are much better similar games which is working fine.",
        "It's a really good game it worked really fast and smooth on my Alcatel firece4... just please try to make a update so it can run smoothly and fix the framerate so it doesn't lag so much on my LG Phoenix 3 it kicks me out sometimes from it lagging too much :( other than that its one the best games I played!",

My only qualm with this game is that everytime you level up a full screen ad gets in the way. Usually they can be closed out easily but not always. Regardless, it's the best free brain training app I have used and it really keeps you sharp!üòÄ",
        "Its rlly a good game for brain training!! Idk why but i didnt find any bug, glitch, or smthing like they all saying. It works well in my device. This is the best app for training your brain. Ofc its not easy, its so challenging, in a good way. I rlly struggle in quick searching and some stages, but its just so addicting and so great!! I recommend you to download it!!!",
        "Additive and helpful. Its not an over night cure so people expecting that need help instead lol. It doesn't deserve a low rating. Yes theres add but it's to be expected with a free game. Having adult a.d.d and huge memory issues.. i can i liked this game. 100 doors is anther good one.",
        "It's fun. My problem is on the attention one we are suppose to click stop once the red dot is on the brain and I do. There is plenty of time to click it  but it tells me i missed it. No matter how many times I click it while the red dot is still on the brain. If I press it 10 times then the screen that tells me I've failed comes up 10 times. Driving me insane.",
        "I love it!!! The games are interesting. Now I am on \"memory match\" game which was initially locked and it keeps on freezing and promotes me to next level without me completing the level well. Besides that, I would highly recommended it to others, it's worth installing.",
        "This is completely addicting in a way I've never felt before! I can still walk away from it but the concepts seem so simple yet provide enough challenge to make me think of it even when I'm not playing! It's delightful to say the least!"

        "If you don't continue to buy skills or bags in the game they will cheat you and make you lose. But constantly asking me to buy something is annoying. Also, good graphics but control are not good enough. It malfunctions and player with bad connection has advantage and wins game and money.  That's problematic.",
        "Well... sometimes when I play some people I think mite be hacking the game or cheating. they don't miss one shot and I make none or sometimes one or two, that is the only down side but other than that it's a good game (suggesten have people by gold or game coins with the money in the game)",
        "The game would be better if you could do anything with the cash you win besides just play in different courts.  Making the player use gold bars for EVERYthing is lame.  I'd rather watch an occasional add and be able to buy cool gear with my cash..",
        "The new bags won after a win are meant to get you to spend real money to open them up quicker by using gold. It's so obvious a money grab for mini games, it's sad. Also, the more real money you pay to get a better in game basketball, the more skills you'll have to beat anyone. That's why so many people scream about cheaters. There aren't any cheaters, just those who paid real money to pad the pockets of miniclip and make the game a true pay-to-win clustermuck.",
        "I liked the game more personally before the recent update. I have a newer phone & since game play mostly in shooting basket race is glitchy, along with buying things on the app, I hate that you can only have room for so many bags it makes it me want to stop playing after a bit. I can see waiting 15 min, 30, 45min, maybe an hour but not up to 12 hours. I used to like being able to buy the standard bag for old gold bar gave me something to look forward too if I won gold in a match.",
        "PLEASE STOP STEALING MY GOLD BARS! FIX THIS SINCE EARLY LAST YEAR DAM IT !!!!!! Great game being for free. But Dam it, DAM IT, DAMMM ITTT !!!! Please STOP  The DAM STEALING !!! many reviews in the pass especially while you were coming Down from being new. Today I worked simple math with a calculator. The calculator verse your after math results answer did not match the calculator. 2nd i have a $1,000. Game cost $500. Entry fee / winnings $1,000. I win I only have $1,000 on my account.

        "There should be a technical scoring piece during each skating event (such as when your practicing in the game's Gym in hard mode in hoping to leveled-up...\"perfect\", \"cool\", \"missed\", etc.). The program component can be a standard score from the AI judges yet will be under review by fans (other players who can add to the overall score, max 4 points only). Lastly, there should be a season that features state, regional, national, world, and finally olympic competition based on the current judging system for the short program and free skate [150-164 meh, 165-174 is okay, 175-189 is very good, 190-199 is excellent, and 200+ is \"strictly Russian\" (Weir, NBC 2018 Winter Olympics)]! Each event should have qualification rounds to add to the nerves of each skater! ( =",

Also i dont like having to pay to get the thinks and to many thinks are whach a vidio to get the thinks it takes to long so i dont l0play it that often. I hope u understand what I'm going through please fix the game up a bit üòÑ",

        "So It's a good game and all but after I reached 1687 fans my coach keeps saying after each round \"let's make me the best skater ever!\" Shouldn't it be changing up? And also should it be me saying that instead of the coach??",
        "Very dissatisfied... I unlocked almost everything I could through watching videos yesterday, and I open the game today and NOTHING is unlocked! So EVERY time you close the game you have to start over? No thanks! Good bye! YOU SUCK with your ad ridden games! Will not be downloading another of yours!"

        "Classic tetris with modern graphics, you can use one touch controls or classic directional pad if you wish, both have their own advantage. I am afraid I can't find Bradinsky song. It's okay for me with advisement because EA need something to eat right? Lol",
        "Enjoyed it at first, and short adverts were expected, but recently adverts have become longer, and now last longer than the game. The latest video advert lasted inbetween games lasted 8 mins....ridiculous!!!. I understand the need for adverts, but if you can't play the game, the adverts are pointless, espeacially if it makes players quit.",
        "I just wanted to play Tetris. Happy to pay for it, was hoping I could pay a $5-10 purchase price and then have the game and play it to my liking. No, need to join the T Club (who comes up with this) and pay an ongoing fee. It's TETRIS from the 80s, EA must you milk everything. Nothing is sacred",
        "Great game, but there's an annoying window that pops up everytime I try and start a new marathon. The window is pretty much useless and wastes my time. Would give this 5 stars if it gets patched",
        "Great game and builds on. The original. The only thing stopping it getting the 5* rating is that the ads on it are sometimes several minutes long and at times when they have finished you can't return to the game. I don't mind watching them as I know that's what funds it, but they are putting me off playing now.",
        "Trying to play Tetris with these abysmal touch and swipe controls is an absolute abject mess. Just add some virtual buttons in, since your loot-boxing asses are supposedly so focussed on 'player choice' lately."

        "This game is the only one of it's kind that I've ever really gotten into. But I fell in love with it and have gotten some real cool friends out of it. They really have thought everything thru and keep improving the game play consistently. Other than not explaining a few parts of the game enough I really don't have any complaints.  You really don't have to spend money, as long as you are an active player an devote enough time to it. And from what I have heard about other games it's not quite as crazy of a $$$ spong as some other games my brother plays. Over all I think this if a great game and I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for that new game to occupy your boredom & spare time. I give it a 9 outta 10.",

Update suggetion: can you please add  more lvls and every time you go up a lvl you get the same stuff but can unlock more of the game but you can diside what you can ulock as i think this will make it much more funnier.  can you also make the game better by letting ipad users join laptop users in clans as i have wwr on my ipad and laptop but on my ipad i cant join my clan that is on my laptop and its unfair so please can you add this in too. I think it will make the game much better thank you   PLEASE READ!!!!!",

Also please remove the components so that everyone is able to buy newer robots... u can make them available in gold or silver or even workshop points",
        "They have fine a great job with this game. The dynamics, the playability, the graphics, and it feels as if you could never stop growing. Every bot is beast with a certain load out and play style.  Update! After playing for over 3 years, and over many different platforms this game rocks. It's definitely not the mech its the pilot kinda game. The balance is good so if you spend money and level quickly you'll be placed on your mechs rating(mech level + weapon level) so take your time and learn some tactics. Every gun has its purpose but it takes a good pilot to make them work.",
        "Game is designed to milk money out of its players. Fun to play. But $200 for a pretend robot or $100 for a single gun. Lower prices. You might be shocked more people can afford 20 than 200......reply- you think giving someone 15 pieces of a random bot that takes 2 games to earn if you place first out of the 10000 you need. Only real option they give is purchas. Don't be fooled. This is a pay to win game.",
        "A great game that brings back the old Mech warrior days. One of the few good theme fps shooters on this platform that is \"FREE\". You can pay to win but it will cost you alot. Investing afew tens to smoother the growth? But you can still have plenty of fun without spending a dime.  Until it slowly draws you in deeper.....",
        "I like how the game has gotten better over past year in many ways.. But could you guys quit making the puzzle peice stuff to get newest goodies? I get you added lots of cool ways to get extras that's cool and all.. But who wants 7 puzzle pieces out of 7,000? Not worth the effort. Keep it gold and silver guys!!"

        "It's a great game but it's such a money pit. 9 out of 10 times if you want something, you better get a credit card out otherwise you're waiting 4 days to unlock it. If it weren't for that, I'd have given 5 stars.",
        "Look it's good but the tournament is way to hard because I have to fight halos and a level 10 I rex and I only have 3 legendary and when they lose I only have a super rare and commons so why when I have this it a good idea to put a person who has one hybrid halo and two legendary. It's just hard okay to win this dinosaur.",

You have to wait 30 minutes between each attempt but its not like I have the time to play every 30 minutes just to be disappointed. So far I have been attempting the same dinosaur for over 24 hours."

There are so many casually wholesome moments throughout it, like a homeless man will come in once in a while and you can decide if you'll give him pizza even though he can't pay. There's people of different sizes, races, cultures. I would die if the game makers made a version of this game but in a coffee shop",
        "I used to really love this game but the difficulty of the game is a little ridiculous. It would really help if the customers who didn't like the pizza say what was wrong with it so I could know what to fix.",
        "Very nice! I love the art, cute voices and the game play!  Non I have seen from the others yet that are just bunches of copycats lol. I'm just into my first hour so  I might change my mind xD",
        "Doesn't like this new update. It ruin my gameplay. My hired buddies is not working at all. I manually put the toppings on the pizza. I did buy all the upgrades before the update. Now i earn less than before. Hope you bring back the one tap auto  toppings. Oh and I'm glad that you didn't remove the auto slice buddy. It's the only upgrade that helps you slice better, not \"MANUALLY\".",
        "Well, the customers are retarded. These little brats don't talk about what do they want. It's unclear. But the gameplay and graphics are pretty good, so here you go 3 stars",
        "This game is pretty fun and addicting. However, it makes my phone EXTREMELY hot and it drains battery like crazy!!! I can only play one game within an hour, or else my battery is completely dead and my phone actually burns you to touch....very bad. The auto-toppings do not go into the circles, and can cause the pizza to be uneven when cut-why have the circles for \"perfection\" if they won't be used? Frustrating. This is an update to my last review, which I couldn't edit because it's gone...???"

        "Love it! I remember saying to myself while playing Dog Hotel \"man I wish they'd make one for horses\" and you did!! I love the game play, a tad bit repetitive but over-all a fantastic job. I especially love the wide range of horse breeds (the unicorn was a surprise indeed), and how easy (but not too easy) it is to get Coins. Buying the horse breed pack really isn't that expensive, a fair price, and definitely affordable. Thank you, can't wait to what else you come up with!",
        "I live this game and hopefully you can make more improvements such as more to do. Also, I used $2.99 and bought the paddock expansion pack after I unlocked them all thinking there would be more to it and there wasn't!!  I want my money back. I'll keep the horse variety one but I want the money back regarding the expansion because there wasn't anything different after I bought it and you didn't have any kind of statement saying anything.",
        "I love horses and this horse game is soooo good! Its really fun!! But I think it needs more detail like when u do dressage and jumping u use a English saddle not a western but in the game they use a western saddle, in steed. And I think that u wouldn't need to pay for different horse breeds. Overall it needs to have more realistic details.",
        "Really repetitive, and all the horses are so similar and everything you do is always the same. The care tasks went quickly at least, but the riding style ones were dull and long. Graphics are very nice, just not much to do.",
        "Overall the apps OK but u guys seriously need to put more breeds of horses into the game for people who don't want to or can't pay for the horse packages and maybe if u guys like added a couple horses that were rejected and could stay at the hotel until a person came  and bought it to up our cash faster. Also maybe create a more diverse races\\obstacle course. And when the horses come in that need to be cleaned u could make their coats look filthy and shiny when they are cleaned to up the rating of the graphics",
        "My fav animal is horses and all but the only 1 thing I hated about this game is. 1st I would like more to do. If y'all fix it I will give ya'll 5 stars. :D but other then that I loved it.Oh and almost forgot I never get any other color of horse except Black and Grey I would like more colors pleasess"

Everything is well thought, new levels and lines are frequently added. So far my favourite app ever, looking forward to playing some new levels and the match option.",
        "I originally had it as 5 stars, but I noticed the longer that I've had the game, the more bugs I'm starting to see. Sometimes the music won't line up with the levels, which is the point of the game, and other times the game won't register my touch and will screw up my progress. If this gets fixed that would be great, and I'd move the rating back to 5 stars!",
        "I really wish you guys didn't update it. It truthfully bugs me that I can't listen to the full song on the menu anymore. The songs are absolutely amazing and the game is very addictive. I hope you will update the game again so that we can just sit and listen to these master pieces if we wanted. Thanks for an awesome game!",
        "Amazing game... Loved it...üòç The tunes are AWESOME!!!  And Bryan swag zone At first even I thought that But... It is a maze so it'll obviously be twisted... (No Hate) It is actually that you should click maybe after the third or fourth turn to get it right... Even I took time to understand that So it's okay üòä",
        "This is by far my favourite mobile game to date. Loads of fun and not covered with ads like every other game out there (while there is a few this one isn't as bad). My only complaint is the new continuation thing. That wasn't there but now it's forced me to watch ads even though I played to remove ads.",
        "It's an amazing game. Sure I run around my bedroom screening every time I fail next to the end.... but there is something about this game that makes you happy. Is it the music? Maybe. Is it the back ground and the way it moves?possibly. It's all of those things plus more   In a nut shell I really really really really really really really really really love this game :p"

        "Th8s game is awesome, it is the best ever!!! But can you add some more cars like the new Cadillacs(xts, xts, xt5, possibly ct6)  in the next update. The only gripe that I have about the game is that the mustang, camaro, and Audi tts seem way too expensive, and the camaro looks weird and boxy in the game. Besides that, the game is amazing!!üòÄ The graphics are amazing, the controls are precise and realistic, weather and vehicle simulations are amazing, customization is awesome( though it could use more wheels, just a nitpick)  maps are very realistic, and the a.i. are unbelievably realistic( though they could use a better braking distance, though isn't that realistic, sorry just another nitpick). This game is far better than any other game in this category! And I just love the the new reverse parking camera, and parking sensors!",
        "cars are look as they are fake the graphics of the car are not at all good but driving school 2016 cars graphic is so good it look real it feels like real but in this very fishy and the steering control of this game damn! please fix it but i really like to play ovilex game but because of these reason am playing Real racing 3 by Electronic arts it very nice its graphic also really good plzzz fix it for me thank uü§ó",
        "This game is amazing! The only thing is I would like the other cars to drive a bit better because they don't all use their signaling lights and they drive at 1 speed all the time which is rather annoying when it's 70km and going 20 mph.  Please fix this thank you billions for this great game, it's recommended to anyone just looking for a non-racing driving game. Only non-racing game I found so thank you ITS WORTH YOUR DOWNLOAD THANK YOU LOVE YOU !!!!!!!",
        "I love the game. Just a thing, I would like some more affordable cars and more SUV's. It would also be great if we could get XP for using freeride, because I've done all the missions like 5 times already and you get tired of the same things over and over. For some reason my engine switch and mirror switch doesn't work.",
        "Graphics are ok and physics are great. Only criticism: with slider pedals and clutch, the clutch has to be slid all the way down when changing gear, but it's a long travel and awkward to do, so you slide the gearstick into place but it doesn't shift. It needs to have a shorter travel and be slightly higher up the screen.",
        "This game is soooo horrible i cant drive or turn just a lil bit without my car going cysco. Its sooo crazy fix it but for now i am not keeping this HORRIBLE game"

This completely ruins all the hard work I did getting my board state the way it was, and makes it impossible to recover. I'm playing up to the 16K range, and it has these issues usually after I've gotten the 4K blocks. 2/6/2018",
        "I enjoy 2048 alot. I play it alot and I would consider myself pretty good, my high score is 250,000. When i was building on that high score, the screen glitched and swiped a number of times, ruining the order of the numbers. This has happened on multiple occasions only in this app. It's not such a big problem for people that are newer, but when you've got big numbers, such as 8192, it makes the game unplayable.",
        "Awesome game I have basically mastered this game. Got a high score of 2,892,204. I made the highest tile which is 131,072. This game is amazing and requires intense focus. I lost focus for a second and a 4 appeared and I didn't notice. Messed me up when I was about to make the 65k tile",

I would assume that they have been \"hacked\" somehow to display these fake scores.  The developer should cap the high score at the number that is literally the highest possible score (based on the size of the board)"

BUT THOSE FREAKING AAAADDDSSS ARE FRACKING ANNOYING.  sometimes i dislike playing...most of the time when you leave the live area the freaking ads kicks in and sometimes its 30 seconds  long and by that time i already lost my finger coordination and i just exit out of the game.  Why can't we purchase the game so the ADS will be gone.  Just like any other apps.",
        "Love the game but recently when I have been coming off the game then when I go back on to play half my coins are gone! Al pretty annoying when trying to play friends.",
        "Love the game!! The only thing I could say that would make it a little better is if they had a throw counter for those good enough to possibly go for a 9/10/11 or 12 dart finish!!",
        "Edit i have enjoyed playing this game and i have done the daily challenges i completed a week and i have continued through and for the past 3 days i been stuck on day 4 i should of completed week 2 but as its staying on day four im not going to get the bonuses....... You need to sort a league out also need to sets and legs against players and also the scoring when it looks like it's in a treble it's given as a single there are not fall outs or hitting wires which make things more interesting",
        "I think it stupid how you match higher average with lower average should be by level also fix your daily challenge i do daily challenge everyday and im still stuck on day 1",
        "Not been getting any money back on declined challenges on one on one games. 4 recent ones ive bet ¬£2500 but the challenger declined and i didn't get my stake back!!"

I, myself, am a free to play gamer, and I struggled to reach lvl 12 with the amount of times I had gotten killed by someone who forked over some cash to easily get a legendary AK or L96. Me, however, grinded to get 800 gold for a UMP after a month or so, then I had deleted the game because I couldn't find a game where I had a fair battle with someone in-game. However this game is still nice.",

Dennoch wundere ich mich sehr √ºber manche der Begriffe. Wer kennt hierzulande zum Beispiel Exxonmobil, oder wer wei√ü, was Ovaltine ist, wenn das Zeug doch bei uns Ovomaltine hei√üt?

I wanna try it on my laptop (I have a feeling its gunna be scarier than my phone cuz its bigger screen than my phone O.O) Please make a download for laptops and I will rate 5 stars  and it also shows on the screen there's night 5 but in game 1",
        "AWESOME I am in love with the 2nd game! It's scary and addicting because you want to come back for more! Fnaf is my fav game in the world and I make awesome fan art for it. (Instagram: Laughingsealey) I am saving up for the mobile versions of fnaf even tho I have all the PC versions. I love the graphics and the lore in this game! Actually, this is the only horror game I will play. I spend hours coming up with theory's and watching theorists make more theory's. Amazing game and it's worth the money!",
        "Awesome but... Great game 10 out 10 but where's toy Freddy when he gets off the stage? It seems like he rarly goes o the play room and I NEVER see him anywhere else not even in the hallway! Please fix this so we can enjoy the game a little bit more. And, what happened to the demo on five night at freddy's 1? Can you please put that back on the app store?",
        "Awesome! I'm a fan of fnaf I wish there's more nights! I love you Scott cawthon! Tip:Toy Bonie comes from the show stage to party room 3 to your left air vent.‚è∞survive til 6pm without doors and a Freddy mask. Another tip:The Freddy mask doesn't work on Foxy just keep flashing your flash light on him he will go away",
        "Best horror game series in all eternity Super fun. Creepy too. Its really challenging because when toy bonnie moves, I cant find him on any camera after he moves from cam 3, so I put on my mask the whole time and then Puppetmaster gets 2 me. Hard and scary! I'd give it 6 stars if I could!",
        "Great Quality I really liked the 3 dimensional graphics the demo had. I passed the first night really easy in my first try. Although yes it does seem more suspenseful having no door only a mask to wear and every time you have to wind up a music box. Other than that, the demo left me hanging to keep on playing."

        "I think this game is pretty cool! Also they added more houses to play in. I love multi-player because I like to see all the scores and I don't like the office because their's spiders and I hate spiders. I beat the Christmas level and I'm trying to beat the other levels too. But when you start the game, it says choose cat and press it and there's a skinny cat with the ears    down. I choose the kitten. But I LOVE the garden level because you go on the slides and you can go in the house and go out of it and go on the carousel and more! But on the picture when you download the game, the cat is in the washer and in the fridge. But you can't do that in the game. I tried too. Its boring at first but it's fun! I also don't know where the cats house is. Is it in the first house? I TOTALLY love it.üòÄüòÄüòÄüòÄüòÄüòÄüòÅüòÅüòÅüòÅüò∫üò∫üò∫üò∫üò∫üò∫üò∏üò∏üò∏üò∏üò∏üò∏üòªüòª",

        "So I'm changing my review. After the past few updates I have won more special dice!! They lowered the level from extra impossible to meduim on the dice Masters, so it's a tad bit more fair! The only problem need, is the daily challenge is too much for the app to stay open. It force closes due to over processing or something, and I'd rather not have the daily challenge and the game work lol. But definitely gaining more stars each update from me!!",
        "This game is fun but I don't know if it's a bug or they're doing it on purpose but it seems like you can never win the extra challenges they do to win prizes.  I have watched the game say I lost when there's no way the computer opponent could have gotten enough points to be me. I messaged the game creators about it and never got a response. I'm about to uninstall this game.",
        "I have downloaded and uninstalled it and did the same process over again and I still can't play it. It keeps telling me that it needs an active internet connection to play. Well, I can play my other internet based mobile games and I am writing this review from the same mobile device and everything else that requires internet is working so it is a fault in the game itself. It's a shame because I really wanted to play this but now I am going to uninstall it and not bother with it again because it is frustrating me. If the issue gets fixed somehow then I may think about playing it.",
        "GAME CODE reveals ROLLS ARE NOT RANDOM - they're pulled from a table of predertirmined outcomes, designed to MILK YOU FOR MONEY at a set rate, based on PvP, reg. Game, Event, Boss, etc.  Just like slot machines & video poker (which i programme).  You must 'assemble' high scoring games, like a puzzle, with majority of yahtzees sitting after 4 or 8 rolls (1 or 7 bonus 'dice'(money) spent)... Like a choose your own adventure book that can cost Hundreds of Dollars.",
        "I'll give this game more than one star once the showdowns are less about the computer clearing and more about real challenge.  Once you start a showdown the computer conveniently never gets a bad roll.  Which wouldn't be a big deal except you have to wait to challenge them again unless you want to pay for extra dice which is used to unlock everything else.  Kinda cheap.",
        "Why am I losing over half of my games? This has happened twice! I have to forfeit several games and when I do all the people start a new game with me. Sorta suspicious. The game has been lagging and freezing also. Otherwise it's a great time passer!"

        "The amount of ads is ridiculous! Especially from that \"Tune Blast\", it's really annoying. And, w/some of the ads you have to wait 30sec before they're done, there's no \"x\" button. The actual mahjong game itself is decent.",
        "Overall, I love the game. The only thing wrong is that there's too many ads! I can't even go from menu to menu without an ad popping up. It's very irritating.",
        "It would be better if there were more tile choices, besides the basic 3. What really annoys me is that if you pause for a few seconds to look up or think of a move, an ad pops up. A 30 second, non skipable ad. The ads are also there after you finish every match. I know you need to make revenue but jeez. Calm down.",
        "I've always loved this gamed.  I wished I could be able before I die to learn how to play the way I see them playing in the movies, the correct way. Not the way we play on cell phones and tablets. I would just lost LUV to play with the tiles, to feel them in my hand etc"

The games are fixed, no matter how much you win they will never give u tokens. Very stingy, greedy and disgusting people. DO NOT DOWNLOAD IT.

I am currently sitting near bottom my league getting beat by teams that are significantly lower rated. Game mechanics are all wrong and the transfer system should revert back to the old way",
        "Good game BUT so damn annoying when your team have to play 3 matches in 1 day. Not enough rest player limited video limited resources to heal player. Add more disappointment have do more training. End of season all player downgraded have to spend more money buying new one. Winning prize.....cheapskate .. stupid developer!",

        "The more I play the more annoying this game is. You have to spend silly money in order to build your team otherwise it's pointless. Losing interest very fast ... asking for 1900 tokens for an assistant manager recommended player ! Ridiculous"

So brilliant game but just be careful what you choose!"

During the boss fight he keeps getting stuck near the door even though I press the control for him to move forward. Plus the controls on the right hand part of the screen are too close to the controls on the phone, so if your finger moves a but too much other apps are popping open when you don't want them to and the game app is closing. Found the jumping upward on level 2 very awkward. Character didn't want to move forward during the jumps. So your continuous trying to climb and starting over if you miss a jump.",

        "I have only had the game a few hours and I am already falling in love with it. It is great to go on when you have a spare 10-15 minutes. The grid is larger than others so I can read the words fluently and quickly without them being hard to see. You get points after each time you complete the grid so if you are really stuck you can receive a hint for some points. I would highly recommend this excellent game.",
        "Only been playing for a few days now, and so far, I love it! Forgot how fun Word Search puzzles can be, and to have it on my phone is priceless lol.. No complaints with the app so far. I will say though, maybe they should tweak it just a tad, instead of giving a hint only after a short moment, possibly creating 'the option' to have a hint may be a little better. Not a big deal to me. It truly is a great app, love the simplicity of the graphic design too. Glad I came across this game.",
        "I enjoy ALMOST the whole game, being a word find and all, simple, yet deceptively hard at times. Still, I wish there was a way to turn off the 'hints' it gives, as they get annoying... unless there IS a way that I haven't discovered yet...otherwise, I REALLY like the game, and would suggest it to all ages, as it's not too tough for the young ones, but still challenging enough for experienced players.",
        "It's a good game but there needs to be a way to turn off hints. If you don't find a word in the time it thinks you should, it keeps giving hints which ruins the gameplay. I pause for various reasons like talking to someone, cat catching a mouse, watching tv at the time, etc.. Or sometimes it might take longer to fins a word than seconds allowed before the hint.",
        "I love this game. Really nice and well thought out game. It's educative too. But I have just one issue with it though: The flashing hint. This gets me distracted each time it flashes. Maybe there could be a hint button at the bottom of the puzzle. That way instead of it flashing and getting us distracted, we could just click on it whenever we need help. Apart from that, it's just perfect. Will give it a 5 when the flashing hint is worked onüòÅ",
        "Other reviews are accurate  for me.. hints become irritating in that they only flash on for a second and you miss them rather than find them useful.  They also appear too soon so you have little time to search.  I also found the occasional issue registering a word and having to go over it several times. But it's a free game, it's fun, it's addictive what else is there to say ? It's good."

        "Great game app!",
        "I love playing slot machine games, and Pop Slots feels like the only game that does not immediately shoot me down when I get a little crazy/ ambitious with my betting. It is the ONLY game I have ever played where I've hit the jackpots on multiple occasions. Now maybe it's all completely luck on my part, but it feels like a game that doesn't immediately take all of your money faster than you can collect it. It's very easy to level up with a good win streak, and those hourly and daily bonus grow pretty quickly. Love this game!",
        "Used to be fun to play when there were decent rewards. For some reason the comp room rewards are gone besides small discount options. Ticket rewards are available for shows nobody would want to pay to see.  I have been playing for a few years now and have saved up quite few loyalty points. I guess we are playing for an occasional comp buffet. What a shame",
        "I like this game..but once i got to a certain level my daily bonus stopped going up.  It has reamined the same and it would be a little more exciting if it would increase the higher you go.  Win or lose is ok with me, it's something to pass free time.",
        "Game is really fun to play probably my favorite, and is the best slot machine app. I've been playing at least 5 years But have recently stopped because it's not fun if you hardly win. And I totally get that it's supposed to be like Vegas, Win some could lose a lot. But it's just a game, it's for entertainment and I get that you can redeem the gold chips for real rewards in Vegas, but that's not why I play. I play because the games and different casinos are fun along with the bonuses. I spend 11 million just to play the pirate gem bonus and only win back 5 million. I could really care less how frequent the gold chips are, you only get 1 in 4ish balloons anyway. I just want to PLAYYY. Especially the bonuses, but it takes forever sometimes for them to be triggered in some casinos. Any chance it can change?",
        "Like almost everyone else on here I loved this game until recently.  Like tonight for instance I was playing mostly the 7s slots.  In less than an hour betting at $120,000 to 180,000 max I went thru 45 million coins!!! I mean COME ON!!!  At the beginning when the payouts are generous I didn't mind purchasing coins,  tickets,  etc... But now forget it not going to spend one more dollar on this game."

        "I m so excited to unveil what happens next, the energy drains hell too quick. I would love if the energy is increased to a lot more because that is effecting the gameplay and annoys me a lot personally. Leaving this issue, the game is fantastic. I have always loved choice games and this current gameplay is the best of all experiences . I wish to read more through your stories..... ‚ù§",
        "I think this game is really good. I just have one problem. Even though it says my energy is full, it feels like I have nothing. And also the mini game 100 energy seems to last longer than the initial 300 you receive. If you could fix this taht would be great. And if it's designed like this can you make energy spending more efficient?",
        "Interesting story so far and great art but the energy runs out far to fast for you to really get very far, even at the beginning which is when the story needs to be able to draw the reader in so you want to come back and read more. Which is why I almost didn't continue and was thinking about just giving it up.  Not to mention the ads completely break up the flow of the story and you don't and can't even get energy from them.  So for these reason I give it a 3 even though I want to rate it as 5, but it's just to irradiating to ignore.",
        "This game really addictive!! The only problem is they don't give you enough energy.üòíyou either have to buy energy or play a mini game to get more energy. The highest energy points that you can get is 100. Plus the 30 points if you watch a video. Other than that the game is AMAZING. The graphics are realistic. It has a lot of romance too. You should definitely download this game if you're not bothered about the energy points.",
        "Fun game but like everyone else says the amount of energy is horrible. 430 energy for 24 hrs and it's gone within a minute or two. Really wish they'd give more energy. I've honestly thought about quitting like others but the storyline has been good. How about increasing the energy up and might have more people play.",
        "The game is super stingy on energy. When I finally caved in and bought the energy (about 20 dollars worth) I received nothing. I tried to email them, which they told me I had to send the request through the support tab in the game, did that too and again, nothing. No help and very costly."

        "This is a very entertaining game that is simple to play. It has provided me with hours of fun! The only thing is that I wish there were more combinations, there are things I've tried that you'd think would make something but don't. For example, Crayon (or Pencil, or Charcoal, or Paint) + Paper does not make Art.",
        "This game is pretty addicting. I get stuck sometimes but I always find something new.  Small issue though, I it won't let me pull rust out onto the screen for some reason. I've used it before, but now it won't let me use it anymore. Perhaps it is an issue with my phone rather than a glitch in the app.",
        "This is leagues better than the original alchemy game. There were a lot of bugs but they've all more or less been patched out. It took me 2 months of playing everyday to get all of the items and combinations cleared.",
        "The interface is not so good. Big icons are not convenient, we have to scroll down long everytime, I could only imagine how much effort would it take if I had 500 items discovered. Please make icons small or a different tab just for icons or just make it like little alchemy one.",
        "I love this game so much. I'm stuck on trying to make life but it's not frustrating it's challenging and I like it. Also, for all the people getting pissed off because the items disappear and you cant 'use' them anymore it's because you can't combine them with anything anymore so it is put in your encyclopedia so that doesn't waste space for the things you can use, it's actually a very smart game mechanic. I'm pretty sure it even says that in the tutorial. I also like how they didn't take the same combination formulas from the first game and instead added new ways to achieve the same product in a more realistic way, also there is so many items to create! So I think that this is an all around great game. Good job developers. Good job indeed.",
        "I love this game. At first time I open it after download, it still okay. But after that, at second day I open the app, my phone will be turned off immediately. I try to uninstall it and just redownload today, but still same. My phone keep turned off if I open the app. Please fix this, I really really want to play :("

        "It started great and I was so looking forward to exploring all the rooms in the mansion. Unfortunately, after a short period of good progress it started putting in lots of delaying features: Read a letter, meet the neighbors, give the neighbors tea, read a book, look for another book. At this rate I'll never get to see another room. So now that I reached the level where I would have to pay them if I want to win any more games, I'm just going to uninstall.",
        "I really like the game but some of the tasks are so annoying (take a nap, read letter, open book and stuff like this). Still playing it and still enjoying it. Will suggest more options for the furniture and definitely options if we don't want to put some of the things, to can take it away. Because the game is obligating us to put things yes or yes even if you don't want it. So for me would be nice to have the option for \"new\" one or \"take it away\".",
        "I have not been able to play for 3 days now. Everytime I log on I can not click the play button even after I go into the app and force stop. It is hard to level up and the power ups don't always work. I have also lost items after winning them. I do not recommend this game sadly because I did find it fun at first.",
        "I really like this game.  I would give it five stars if you change a couple of things.  We should be able to create our own character,  there should be a player code that we could type in to go to a friends mansion.  But other than those things this is a great game that is a lot of fun for all ages!",
        "I like the game but some of the tasks are sometimes annoying. I'd rather have more design elements than waste stars repairing a tablet that some idiot damaged. Seriously, the levels are tough which makes stupid tasks really irritating.  If you want to stretch the game that way please make the levels easier, its really annoying.",
        "Haven't been able to log in to play for two days now. It's like the game is stuck. I've tried to force stop, restart my phone. Nothing works. I'd hate to uninstall because I've put a lot into this game. Please help!!"

        "Had found a phone on the job sight and played the sample version. I HAD to download it as soon as I got access to my own shine. I play constantly!  Haven't gotten very far yet. Thing I DON'T like is you don't get an average..... IF you do, I've yet to find where it is in the game. That's in NO way a deal breaker. So, GO DOWNLOAD IT!  See for yourself just how additive & F-U-N it is!!! üòâüíØ",
        "I love this app its better than any other bowling app I've tried before.",
        "Quick fire is the best but theres only one down fall, the seconds. When you get to the last seconds it doesnt give you your last strike and the other person wins.they should fix that.you have to score right on the 2 second count b4 you get ur last strike. Please fix it so peoples last strike can count, thank you, other than that its a great and awesome game to play to challenge your players. üëçüëçüåüüåüüåüüåüüåüüåüüåüüåüüåüüåüüåü...also the developer should add macau lanes, London lanes and pins..",
        "Great graphics and realistic feel to the lanes. Controls are a bit wonky, however, and purists won't like being being able to steer the ball after it leaves your \"hand.\" LOTS of attempted upsells, but its free to play features ain't too bad on their own, either. All in all, a decent little bowling game.",
        "It's a  fun game but it's rigged. I think if you have a billion chips you shouldn't be able to play on lower lanes. I thought you were supposed to be matched up with people who are the same or close level. How is it I'm bowling against someone who is level 171 and 8 billion chips and  I'm level 43 .",
        "Amazing.  It's just fun watching the bowling hall whizz by and get a strike.  I've played and uninstalled this game, but the only reason for the uninstall part is storage.  For all of you who are new, try getting the ball between the front pin and either of the pins next to it, it usually gets strikes, but by strikes I mean doubles against level 7 Russians."

Please fix this as soon as possible because I really enjoy this game.",

All other puzzle improve your skills but this isn't since you have no time to caulate the expression it's more a test of memory then calculation because you can only 3 star it if you know the expression by heart if you try workout you answer right but run out of time. You should make is so each correct answer adds time so you can accurately l improve.",

If you need help in any of those subjects (or you just like a bit of fun ) I would dwfinately say this is the game for you.",
        "Simple but fun. These games are challenging and do make you use your brain without taking much time. You can play a few levels in just a few minutes easily. Ads are not too bad either, not too obtrusive and are sporadic enough.",
        "This brain definitely makes me feel like the front of my head is working. But the constant advertisements between every few levels is very annoying. Especially when a level takes 15 seconds and the ad runs the same length.  Would suggest the paid version if you like it."

        "I like it a lot but I hate how the drawings are so linked with pokemon go. I hate pokemon go!!!!! The graphics are okay but I wish they were a bit better quality. It is confusing if you pick paint or something it just goes back to the original colour. I didn't like how easy the drawings were and I don't think the glow art works. It just comes out as crayon. I wouldn't recommend this game if you don't like colouring. It's ok!!!!",
        "I love this app! It's sooo good. And its brilliant for when your bored. But its a little hard sometimes to go over the lines with our fingers as the lines are so thin. But overall I think it's a fantastic app!",
        "I love this game but i don't like the characters tho .but it's fine . I like the way you can colour it in and then do the glow pen around it and at the end it looks amazing . You just colour and then press the pencil button ontop of the rubber in the pictures right bottom corner and then do the glow pen thing . Some people may don't know so that's why they don't like it . It's good when your travelling or when your bored . O THIS GAME IS AMAZING!!!I like it",
        "I think there should be more cartoons to draw and color. And it should not always be right colors to trace it in. Also i think that one small part of the picture shouldn't color the whole background, because what if you didn't want them bother the same exact color, because no affence, but it looks weird and ugly sometimes. Sorry for no compliments.                    LOVE, YOUR DEAR FRIEND!!!",
        "It's a great app however it keeps crashing and I have to start the drawing all over again. The whole app stops and my drawing starts over and it's really annoying. If this gets fixed I will definitely rate 5 stars",
        "I like it because it teaches young artists how to draw animated characters such as Pok√©mon Avengers Princess and loads more characters from movies like Snow white and the seven dwarfs and Toy story 2! Overall it is a brilliant app for boys and girls of all ages!"

The only things that would make it better is if it would let us type our own responses and the system understood them and was able to respond and if there was actually more \"proving innocence\" and less tetrisy type games.. But that doesn't not effect my interest at all. Most addictive and fun game I have found. Will def recommend",
        "UPDATE : Changed from 5 stars to 3 because of the puzzles. As you get further into the game, it is obvious that you are supposed to spend money because you are literally not given enough of the right color blocks to complete the puzzles without purchased hacks. That really sucks. Too bad.    This is an interesting game with some unique interfaces and an engrossing plot. You interact with the other characters (in-game AI) via chat, and telephone (in-game AI) to learn the plot and your place in it. In order to access the info you need to move forward, you have to solve puzzles. Very cool, love it.",
        "It is great, nice and interesting story that makes me keep playing. What really bothers me is the fact that the puzzle takes FOREVER to solve. I know that the farther you are in a game the harder it gets, but it's just not logic to collect 25 pieces of each color at a puzzle and they only throw you 15-20 pieces and in such little amount of moves. The only way to solve it is spending money buying hacks or having too much patience. I would have deleted it long time ago if it wasn't for the story.",
        "This game is great. It's my favorite game of all thus far. I love this game. It's so addicting and the story line is perfect. I love how you can text and also receive/make calls. Great game for people who like puzzles and mystery. Passes the time quickly. Only thing I am having problems with is trying to link it to my facebook. The first time I had this game I had gotten pretty far and logged in with ease, long story short, got a new phone, installed my game, try to connect to my facebook for my saved game and.... my phone glitches and shuts me out. So I had to start over. Other than that this game is great I would recommend to anyone.",
        "I like the idea but the responses are off quite often. For example: \"Please don't hang up!\" -I'm here \"I don't know! Not a clue. Doesn't make sense and breaks the immersion.   It's another game similar to SIM - Sara is Missing, which I'd recommend for now. It's more polished and engaging. The characters are more distinct than in I Am Innocent.  This just seems to be designed to make you spend cash eventually, not because someone actually enjoyed developing it.",
        "It's honestly pretty good. It's rare that an app game keeps my attention for more than a week, but this one has kept me going for a while now. The story is interesting enough for me to keep going with the puzzles, however, I would like a little more writing and editing to be done with the dialogue. It can be kinda regular and break immersion. But it's still entertaining."

        "This game is perfect for anyone who loves magic, fantasy, collecting, and a whole new level of adorable! Dragonvale takes everything to the next level! I highly recommend it, as it is a amazing game, my most played, and I hope everyone else enjoys it just as much as I do. Five stars! üåüüåüüåüüåüüåü Edit 2: I was re-organizing my islands by Element the other day, and I had just finished the Plant Island. I put down a Oversized Oak Tree, and immediately, a image flashed through my mind: a young girl, sitting on a branch of the oak tree, a book in one hand, a baby Plant dragon sitting next to her. Stretched out in front of them was my Plant Island, the dragons freely soaring, the other islands in the distance. And that sparked a inspiration in my head. I just wanted to ask; can I write a Dragonvale book, which takes place at my park? Please let me know !  :)",
        "Cmon Backflip! Okay look I love Dragonvale, I've been playing it forever. First off I lost my amazing park a while back and that really sucked. But now I am restarting and I go to buy the beginners pack for 9.99 and it says there was an error and i wont be charged...come to find out it did charge me and i didnt receive anything! Please help",
        "I have been playing for a while. After events you get a day to turn in your event specific currency for the prizes, even though the event has ended. Well for Gardenia's event, it turned in all my roses before I could exchange them. I had over 25,000 and was so pumped to get the new dragons. Now I don't have any roses and 25,000,000 extra coins i don't need. Please help. This is a very frustrating bug.",
        "I really love collecting all of the dragons and the fact that you can theme/decorate your park too. But the amount of types of decorations are unbalanced, the majority that you can currently buy in the market are just plant and earth type while there are very few decorations of the other types (such as air, cold, etc).",
        "When I first had it it was super fun. Then I saw a game I wanted so I deleted it I did that before and got it back I could log into facebook and go to my old island. But this time I could not. I was so far and looking forward to seeimg my dragons but it did not let me go to my old island. It left me im tears that I had to do what I did all over again. So I deleted this stupid game and gave this. If I could rate 0 I would",
        "its ok, and you might think you cant li e without it, but trust me.... after a while year of playing, which is what i have waited to wrote this review, the game play becomes very repetitive. sure try it out, its fun, but not something for the rest of your life. dont put money into it, you will regret ir later."

        "Very realistic and nice game. Missions and descriptions are entertaining. Controls are also great.   Can u add more weather effects and timings like sunset, rain, snow etc. The wipers lie unused in cockpit! What abt adding lights to airplanes -nav, position lights? Some real life airline like texture could be added to make it better.        Overall, one of the best bet for airplane enthusiasts!",
        "Well, THAT. IS. AWESOME ! I suggest to continue developing this game...that about multiplayer mode? What about if you can get money from flights , to buy new planes ? That about making new aircraft types? For example: very big planes can take more passengers to get more money but have low speeds? And other planes which are fast but with less passengers ? And best of all, why not if there is a big map which many players (about 1000 maybe) can buy airports , and transport people to different players airports? Please try and make at least some ideas into ACTION! (Not kidding, this can make the game a blast!) .......I am also sorry for people who find this hard but with some practice you can be an expert!",
        "Its quite good but a little bit of fixing will do. The part \"Slow Down thing\" can you please please place that where it can not block the view of the player. It is very difficult to see whats behind it so it causes us players to crash. T.Y",
        "Great game but more issues to address.  The longer flight durations are a real waste of time,  make them more challenging rather than waiting for the destination. Also add more controls as the ones we have are not effective. How do you tell me to slow down yet i don't have the option for that?",
        "What is this. I was on level 1 and i just got to the last checkpoint and when I had to land it crashed when it took so much effort into going through them checkpoints. I recommend you do not get this game unless you are good with airplanes and have experience (which I do but this game just ruined it). I shall see this development soon.",
        "Why the hell they add brake when we cannot see the brake option even after landing which forces us to crash. Total stupidity do not waste time in downloading. Previously was better when there were no brakes just reverse it and stop or keep brake button always active."

This app has some energy to sense love, friendship or even fun idk and what not? Well, when you get to kiss your girlfriend 4 times in 30 minutes, its seriously no joke. What's the secret behind the energies absorbed by the app? I wonder. Whatever it is, all I wanna say is Thank you üòÑ",

And when I get dare they dare me to smell everyone in the house mouthes and socks and it's so boring it's not funny so don't install this game and its so bad I will never said bye üò¨üò¨üò†üò†üò°üò°üôÖüôÖüòùüòù",
        "The dares were so unfair. Exampel: my sister would have the easiest dares like, choose someone to give you a foot massage. WHAT! Then(during flue season) they going to tell you to lick the bottom of your shoe! GROSS!  Or do a handstand for 12 seconds. I refuse to do either.",
        "I like this app because it has fun dares and truths. But one thing it disgusting about this app is after every two -three truths or dares the adds come and this is irritating.so if you stop pitting the ads every time then I would date it a 5 star. But all the best for you guys and make more fun app like thisüòäüòäüòä",

        "I love this game but an issue im having since the newest update os why im giving 2 stars at the moment. Ever since the update the game will not load. Says \"loading cantina\" then closes the app completely. Im gonna end up getting kicked out of my guild...please fix this! Soon as its fixed it will return it to 5 stars bc the overall game is badass!",
        "Very addictive. I started playing casually, and 4 weeks later I find myself checking it all the time. It's best played with at least a minor investment, but reasonably ftp...if you got patience.  Add: it's been six months, and I'm still hammering away at it. It has a huge base of fans,and I've only needed customer support once (and they handled my issue very well and quickly).  Still a bit grind-y, but great little bit of clicky gaming.",
        "The game is fun enough but to sync it with your Google account to have to give your phone and all its abilities to EA. Why is there a need for the game to access my photos and make and answer calls? How 'bout I play a game on my phone with cool light sabers and fun music and when I need to make a call I'll stop for a bit. Just let people play and EA can make bank with their microtransactions. GTFO of people's personal info.",
        "I Personally would like to have the ability to upgrade stars on heroes easier without spending real money. Get 2 to 3 stars on the characters for free leaves me wanting, and im just not spending money on a game like this. Otherwise it is a fun game. Even though it basically can be a full time job you dont make money on and have to spend money on. So if you dont mind commiting months to barely make it to do the late game stuff amd still have to spend months to progress. This game will be great. This review is for those who play ftp games without actually paying to win.",
        "Good game but be warned to really get any good characters you're either going to have to pay lots of real money or you'll find yourself grinding forever the same nodes to upgrade the characters that you have. With that said this game is a big improvement over heroes of dragon age of which in many ways this game is modeled after . It seems very clear that some of the devs from that game migrated to this game to start it up. The last update at 02-26-18 freezes at loading screen and then force closes come on devs get on this!",
        "Really good game. I love games where you have to grind to get the best character with a slight bit of luck if you pull them. The only thing i would change is how long it takes to get your energy back as. I feel like when i run out i cant play the game gor a long time as it takes a lot of time to get your energy back. But overall would fully recommend"

        "Most puzzles are self explanatory. The odd few appeared to be impossible without some instruction. Few levels I had to skip probably around 7 levels. Couple due to pieces not moving or stuck. Very happy to be able to skip levels.  Would have been great to have a certain bank of hints for some of the  difficult ones. I found the later levels easier than the ones around 100. Max levels 120. Great fun!",

Level 89 doesn't work, as well as other levels where touching the same place over and over and over might get something to work.  Most puzzles are extremely easy,  it's just a matter of the game not working.",

        "Not responsive to most touches. I finally got a cheat only to realize it was the game.  Ads were not frequent but had a strobe light going off (health issues) and would not turn off. Had to close out of the game every time so I just quit playing. Typo many similar more challenging games out there to try and work with this one.",

        "As others have said, the longer you play, the worse it performs and the more space it takes up, and after a while ads start causing the game to crash. However I've managed to get around it by reinstalling every couple of weeks. Other than that it's a good little game.",
        "It's a pretty fun game, better than I thought it would be. There is one problem, you don't really need to buy \"Flooz\", but if you do. The prices are a little outrageous. Like 5$ for 100 Flooz, seems a little money hungry. And 100 Flooz for 15 days is 29$ is outrageous as well. I've played other games with better things to do besides upgrading and usually 100 \"diamonds\" of anything would last 30 and would cost 10-15$. Seems like you're trying to rip people off. Besides the money hungry creators, good game to kill time.",
        "The first idle game that caught my attention. At first, i thought that it's just \"one of those idle games\".. But, the more I play the more i get hooked because of unique game mechanics. I might give this 5 stars in the future.",
        "I think the game would be enjoyable if it did not crash ALL the time. Get to a new level? Crash. Watch a video? Crash. Crash Them All might be a more fitting name for the only game that has ever crashed more than once on this phone.",
        "It has bugs. Like how sometimes skills don't activate right away, and on rare occasions, not at all. The currencies are pretty fair; I don't feel like have to buy anything (sucks for the devs, but it's not like I can buy anything even if I wanted to). Events keep the game fresh, and I always feel like I have something to do at all times, so it does a good job of keeping me occupied for 20-30 minutes at a time.",
        "Incredible game play it for hours and love it soooo much only good things to say other than server connecting but it's no big deal love the game the style the graphics the game play is all awsome I do have some ideas for the game if your interested number one being adding carnivore and herbivore types into the game so you could have dinosaurs and number 2 is world bosses were the entire community can all defeat one boss and 3 to have the ability to friend people not through Facebook. Love the game it's so good thanks for putting so much hard work into it and adding awsome features cheers"

        "Overall... I'd have to say it's a very basic game and I wish there was more to it. I have always loved the Simpson's and playing a game based on their life is surely interesting. However, I was hoping that it would be more realistic, fun and free. It turns out that it's a P2P game and that took my surprise because it really is unfortunate. I hope they improve the gameplay and graphics. More updates will definitely bring more players.",
        "I have been plying this game for years i love it and quite often play more than once a day. The graphics are great as are all the challenges i hopr you bring the gifts for visiting you friends towns back i hopr this game goes on for a long time most of my family play to x",
        "Crafted a straight trench & boom my crafty points disappeared The IRS radius shortened, clicking finished jobs doesnt redirect me to the Toon player. Train tracks cant be crafted anymore. The Claw machine gives Bowling shoes WTH. Maka Sprungfuld gret agan!",
        "I found my old account, used some money, couldn't log in no more,  deleted the game, now it won't even download. I can not recommend this type of gaming. I'm trying to get online more than I can play. For me this is frustrating and hilarious. I guess I will find a similar game and rater use my money and time there?",
        "Great game for Simpsons fans. But what kills the fun are constantly new side missions. Just as you finished one, two new shows up. You can never concentrate on what's most important and that's building the Springfield but rather playing with some ruffians at the time now.",
        "I used to give this a 5 star rating but at level 150 I maxed out the amount of items I can have in my Springfield. Playing the game at this stage is pretty useless. I'm not a hoarder, my Springfield is beautifully arranged so there is no way I will delete things in order to build new houses or place new items. Will come back when the cap is increased but for now I'm sadly forced to take a break."

Would like to see sales for diamonds... I don't mind throwing a few bucks here and there for a game/app on a phone. Prices are a little steep IMO.....",
        "It's a good time killer. The thing that makes me think about deleting this app is how it keeps overriding my phone. I keep turning notifications off for this app, but the game will turn them back on again. It's so annoying to have my phone buzz just to find out its just this stupid game telling me my scientists are done or waiting for a task.",
        "Good fun until you figure out that you only need to build area 52 up. At level 500 it jumps by 5000000% or something stupid. Meaning can clear a planet in just hours. Needs a different hook to it. After a few planets it's a bit stale.  The choices to buy in multiples of needs moving. With fat fingers I've caught the research aswel as hitting Max a few times",
        "Usual game where numbers get ridiculous and good at killing time. Very good features and well balanced - so far. Like with many of these games nearer the later stages the completion time can be calculated and nobody wants to tap for 211 years to complete the next round. Hopefully this game sidesteps that.",
        "Update to previous review: Devs seem on it. After the last update there seemed to be a bug or two. A couple of us let them know and they fixed it within a week. Good game, come and go on your own time, well maintained. Thanks guys!  --------- I'd have to agree about the slow down for the red bacteria after the update. It used to come between 1.5 and 3 mins. Now I can go 10 minutes looking at the screen before one comes. It makes the game more of a waste of time than fun. Other than that, I was really liking it. Played it more than most games.",
        "Yes it's a tapper buy done is a very unique way and totally worth your time. The fact that your goal is to destroy planets and that you are sending all your energy to the planet makes sense that you have to start back up. Been playing for almost 3 months and I keep checking back in to destroy planets."
