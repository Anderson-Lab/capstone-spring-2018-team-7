     [ 'I love playing this game and would give this app a lot more stars, but for some odd reason I am not showing as completed the Goal of the level I am currently on. It\'s very frustrating to me because I have hit the targeted first Star and had recently hit ALL THREE Stars showing normally that I completed the Goal. No dice. I hope someone fixes this bug soon. It\'s making me not want to play anymore and I love playing this with my kids.',
       'I love this game. It\'s so good. HOWEVER, I paid for 50 gold bars and one of each extra(i.e. Pinwheel, lollipop, striped candy, etc...). After the payment went through, I only received 14 gold bars and NO extras. Please help. I have been stuck on level 348 for several weeks, because of that blasted bomb, and need the extras to help pass it. Do you have a hint on how to pass this level?',
       'If you like bejeweled Type puzzle games you will love this one. It\'s far more challenging with every level. Sometimes I wanna throw my iPad or phone at the wall...but I can\'t get enough of this game!',
       'Love this game so much.  Just that some of the games are too hard.  I got hung up on a game 226 or so for like over 2 years.  I stopped playing for a long time because I was so tired of that tough game.  But back to playing again.',
       'O jogo tem potencial pra ser ótimo e poderia se espelhar mais nos modos de Bejeweled. Mas chega a ser ridícula a forma como o nível dos estágios sobe aleatória e drasticamente, praticamente obrigando o usuário a gastar dinheiro pra passar. E é MUITO dinheiro: você compra um jogo AAA de PC pelo preço de uns dois Charm daqui.',
       'It is very challenging. When you get stuck on a level it takes a while for you to actually pass it.   You will be so relieved until the next level. It\'s even harder than the previous level. So. Good Luck. Have fun.' ],

     [ 'Honestly i really enjoy the game thus far thank you for all the recent updates niantic... but there is one thing that has been bothering me and that is 1v1 with friends and trading... both features were shown in the original trailer... yet again i love the care your giving the game niantic i truly praise it but i would like to know whats happening with my 2 listed thoughts',
       'Simply just needs more events. I get why trading isnt available yet, which is to prevent RMT and if you have RMT that\'s just the end of the game. But hope you could soon add the 1v1 battle feature, BUT WITH MOVES LIKE THE REAL GAME NOT JUST TAP AND USING THE SPECIAL SKILL.   Overall love it tho, been walking 2km/day for 2 whole weeks now. (Lookin for a gastly xD)',
       'Please have more legendary raid events with gen 1 and 2 Pokemon for new and returning players who want to collect everything. With regards to using GPS and joystick cheats you guys actually benefit by getting more players from rural areas or dangerous areas playing and spending money. Besides you still have to do all the hard work minus the walking so it technically isn\'t that unfair to others especially since everyone is level 40 these days with legendary Pokemon. The game is already balanced just needs more events. Please consider a premium service to pay for where we can use a joystick in game. We can pay monthly or something so everyone benefits.',
       'I love this game! Been just playing on my wife\'s account. Just recently decided to make my own, and it will not let me get past choosing my first Pokemon. They all spawn in the same spot and it quickly shows error 11 or whatever and won\'t even register me moving. I\'ve tried everything to toubleshoot and fix it. Nothings working. Really sucks because I love playing. Can someone fix this or tell me what\'s going on?',
       'thx for niantic that always listened our sugesttion, but i wish we can trade or battling with other player around the world by staying at poke center or else... - and btw you should update the new gym and new pokestop... since when i was on holiday in Indonesia theres not so much pokestop and gym around :( even there are many landmark in there - another suggestion plz maked some item that can be used to summon legendary/raid battle in location that we want, so its much easier  for the communities to do raid battle in specific location',
       'Can you developers make it so people can trade pokemon and other things like items? Itll make the game sooooo much better if teamates could trade items and Pokemon. People did it with cards, atleast to trade Pokemon. My bf and i play along with his friend David and when one of them need something that i got and visa versa, we should be able to trade. If you guys can make it happen, ill give this 5 stars instead of 4.' ],

Please KING fix this problem!  UPDATE as of 21st February: the message "go online for more episodes" is still showing everytime I try and play. So still not fixed in the new update! PLEASE FIX!!',
       'U want 5***\'s, well hard is ridiculously too hard, it has impossible levels that  you only win,  when king wants you to, this is so utterly ridiculous! Really makes me want to uninstall the game. I will give it another try, I\'m waiting for the game to divvy out more tries.. I mean 35 tries is stingy for a hard level, how about 45 tries instead?',

I know I logged in yesterday and didn\'t miss a day. I also was moved down a bubble level. Updates should not make you lose everything you\'ve earned.',

I hate to Uninstall being I\'m at level 727 & Hitting the (X) does nothing but frustrates me & I\'m just about to delete. 😠 Please change some how some way.',
       'One of my favorite games, but after the most recent update, just like most of the reviews in the last several days, I\'m stuck at 705. I should be at 1153.

     [ 'Nice game with very good events but the drop rates to heroes of 5 star is too low i killed a lot of gems and scrols and hero orbs and my first 5 star i  dropped it at lvl 75. Okok now again event of summoning 100 scrolls and i continue still no 5 star hero only 4, just try and fix the drop rate. In the rest its a nice game.',
       'Fun at first, but you have to pay a lot of real money for it to stay fun. Otherwise you have to wait weeks and months to progress. Some events can only be fully completed by spending hundreds of dollars (yeah, that much). Not worth it. If you have that much money, use it on something better than this. Improve your life, use your time better, don\'t waste it here. Good luck!',
       'I purchased the spring festival card on top of all the money I\'ve already dumped into this game and the devs didn\'t give me my in game rewards. I\'ve submitted numerous tickets to get a refund or my rewards and they just reply there is no problem. Ya no problem with you taking my money.  They deleted my review, wonder how many other people had this issue and had reviews deleted.',
       'Wasn\'t sure about this game at first. I love it. I use a f2p  and a vip one  to see  the difference  between the two. Really well done. Having said all that the game does require patience. This is an IDLE game. You pick it up do dailies, talk, spend money, or what ever you want to do in game, then put it down to "farm gold,xp,mats". The high end heros do take some planning to aquire as a f2p player. This game requires patience because it\'s an IDLE game. Yes some people have a ton of money to throw at the game but don\'t be jealous, just play your game and have fun.',
       'Not what I expected, given that my first impression of it was of IH being an "annoying add". Once I decided to pick it up though my thoughts changed rather drastically.   It\'s simple, it\'s fun and the warm colour palette of the graphics make a nice change compared to the widespread use of bleak colours in other games.   If you think you might enjoy this game, you sure are my friend.',
       'Too much pay to win, free players hardly getting anywhere in the events and so fourth, not fair, increase the rewards of spending money and give free players more too easily solved, I previously rated it 5 stars instantly loved it but as I\'ve progressed it\'s just not fair!! Please do something!! I am vip6 but I\'m not rich, please bring more rewards for loyal free users who watch the ads and everything!! Thank you!!' ],

Please help and put me back to the level ahead of me as this is very upsetting for spending money and being right back where I was before. Fix it and I\'ll give it 5 stars for everything thank you',

     [ 'I Love Gardenscapes and It Is Fun Way to Be Creative.  A Recent Update has Made it Definitely Better.  The Support Team Has Been Exceptional With Quick Responses and Answers!  There is Room for Improvement in the Amount of Coins Obtained in Completing Tasks, as Well as Eliminating Repetitious Tasks Requiring More Moves.',
       'Cant sync with facebook gameroom so all money spent on there and had to start again when tablet was fixed and wanted to move back.  Another playrix cash cow... and the sole reason all payments have now stopped... stop making levels that can only be passed when players are made to pay to advance.',
       'I try other games that are similar to Gardenscape but after playing them for 5 minutes I delete them. They will never be as good as Austin designing his garden. Thank you Team for creating such a brilliant game.',
       'This game is a lot of fun and must admit. My biggest complaint is it\'s so expensive. I\'ve spent more on this game than any other game! Once you get so far along in the game, plan on forking out $$$. On some levels you\'ll need 2 or 3 boosters and extra moves to beat one level to win one star. They will use all kinds of tricks to get you to spend more and more money.',
       'I enjoy playing Gardenscapes. I appreciate the ways we get bonus items to help complete the level. The latest update put in something annoying and frustrating tho.

     [ 'I love decorating the rooms but I am having to pay too much to get enough points to do it.   I also don\'t like that each room requires more points to do the tasks than the previous room.  I have changed my rating to low because you end up spending too much of your own money to get powerful to get your stars to complete the tasks.  They also lose your purchases.  I bought a desk chair yesterday and now it is missing and the task is gone too.  Rip off.',
       'Never thought it would be this addictive! At first i thought "Oh, its THAT game that always pops up in advertisements." but after deciding to give it a try, i am hooked!   I introduced homescapes to my mom as well and downloaded it for her and she finds it adorable and fun as well. We both take time to chill out and have fun with the puzzles occasionally when we are together.   I cant find a single flaw or critique for this game, its amazing :)',
       'Veeery enjoyable game! I feel like it\'s advertised too much, but it\'s definitely worth playing. Especially if you love games like Bejeweled!  Some of the levels are unnecessarily difficult to get by. You have to either get lucky, or be some type of strategic genius to pass them within a good time frame. That\'s slightly disappounting. Its too much of an encouragement to use money.',
       'Homescapes is an awesome game, combining the relaxation (and frustration!) of match 3 games with the joy of renovating a fabulous mansion. Throw in the fascinating story line, lovable characters lovely music and stunning graphics (except the kitchen wallpaper lol), I\'ll be playing this for a long time! I\'m working on the living room right now, getting close to level 600. Can\'t wait to see what the new character, Jerry, has in store for us! Thank you Playrix!',
       'I really like this Game so Far. I will play for awhile to See how it Works & If I like it. Absolutely Love Your Game. Play it ALL THE TIME!!! I Must Admit that I Really Do enjoy this Game! Sometimes I find myself Having a Hard Time With Certain Levels. I Could be On that Level for Days or a Few Weeks. I think with Some Improvement that Would make People Play. This Game More. But I Must Say Hat\'s Off to The Developers',
       'This game is awesome. But the stars, please increase the amount of star not just 1. Make it 2 for the Hard Level. And lastly, it\'s hard to download new rooms when it always appear the Technical Error. Better if you do not require to download it and the user can open it without connecting to internet. However, the game is great for relaxing. Keep up the good work!' ],

     [ 'A giant mess of people who pay a ton of money to prey on anyone with impunity. Absolutely no rules regarding who or how often you can attack someone significantly lower in level. Even if you are stupid enough to pour money into this garbage, you will get your butt handed to you by someone else.',
       'Has alot to keep you busy. For that i give 5 stars. Minus 1 star because certain features in the game cannot be unlocked unless you spend money. To me thats a recipe for a slow death. For i will soon be leaving guns of glory in a blaze of glory based on that alone.',
       'This a pay to win game with lootboxes of different packs. They will keep making you spend with micro transaction of useless stuff to get the real thing you seek. Once, they took my money and the item was not delivered to me because i asked refund before, for a pack called "hope gemstones pack" but after 3 times of 20 bucks purchases, i did not get a single hope gemstone. A scam game in a very good way to steal your money. On the other hand, the game is very addictive and well made. If only the developer has a bit of decency..',
       'Need some updates like 2 simultaneously upgrade option. Less but more extensive research. Lengthy process is boring. I know by spending money u can get rid of it but money making shouldn\'t be always a concern.',
       'Could be a five star game, but needs improvement. Screen zoom is totally non-existant. No zoom out, constant "finger scrolling " required. ZOOM OUT,  ZOOM OUT,  ZOOM OUT!!!!!   ALSO 1.5 UPDATE?  GREAT JOB GUYS!  YOU FORGOT TO POST THE UPDATE!!!    WHAT A JOKE  They are currently giving APPLE users the 1.5 game upgrade. And gave Android user the middle finger. APPLE users now have a clear advantage over Android users.   So dont talk aboit you vare about customers… they don\'t . Clearly an APPLE culture designer.  Still haven\'t posted Android tablet update to ver 1.5 (droid haters)',
       'I really like the game at first. I gave it 5 stars but after a few weeks, i change to 3 stars only. Every time after the update, i cannot play the game. It always "connection problem. please reconnect" and until now i cannot play the game anymore. This game only wants your money.' ],

     [ 'I think this is an exceptionally well made game. This truly is a great golf game. Here\'s where it falls flat... I feel as if you must spend money in order to receive all the benefits that the game had to offer.  If you have 8Ball pool, then this will make sense to you. You can still curve your shot, even if you don\'t pay for anything in the game. In this game, however, you cannot adjust the curve at all when you use the basic ball. I feel as if it is closer to "Pay to Win" than other games of similar nature.',
       'Best game period. Not just golf or sports game, but any game. Wouldn\'t change a thing. All ya all who say, oh they need to change this or that, and why do I have to play someone who\'s better than me? Well it\'s because you suck, and you have no hand eye coordination. Just shut up and dribb, uh I mean play. #1 game for a reason peeps. Love ya. Dueces. Peace biatches.',
       'Game is based on luck. Could be so much better if it was more realistic ie club selection. How can it be fair when it is easier to chip in from off the green than it is to hole a putt? NEED TO FIX BUG THAT MAKES MY SHOT HAPPEN WITHOUT MY FINGER LEAVING TABLET SCREEN!!! HAS COST ME HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF COINS!!! When are you going to fix this issue??? If this was my game I would be extremely embarrassed with all the fault\'s',
       'This game could use better and easier ways to earn money for opening the chests and scoring or pay outs after each prize or game. So you can get better equipment and achievements. Would help keep players more interested. My only dislikes so far. I most definitely enjoy the game and think it\'s pretty awesome!',
       'Stop changing the winf its getting boring now !!  I mastered the wind only for ypu to make it not work in in some games or even make the wind twice as strong as the value stated. You should be matched on games played not trophies. Otherwise the good players who go up the trophies quickly always play people with better clubs. The game goes easy on you if you\'re not good at it which defeats the point of getting good',
       'This game is really starting to piss me off.  Main issue I\'m having is the stupid game freezing and telling me it\'s trying to reconnect in the middle of a game.  I\'ll make a shot then it will continue to count me down and tell me I\'m out of time.  Freezes until my times up. I\'ve lost close to 200k in coins lately and it\'s really starting to piss me off. Also, never consistent. I\'ll make a near identical shot as my opponent and ball travels completely different. Really starting to piss me off. Been playing this game for a LONG time and I\'m about ready to delete it!' ],

     [ 'One way to check how much products I have left is by touching the machine and thr corresponding product but sometimes the game will assume  that you are putting the product into production hence it will put the product into production whether you want it or not so it will waste production time. Sometimes the touch is too sensitive. Sometimes the touch is not sensitive enough which forces me to drag the product into the production slot up to 10 ten times just to start production. I know this feedback is not much but maybe an undo button will help. It makes the gameplay million times difference if you  put your players comfort a priority.',
       'They keep taking my diamonds and telling me I spent them somewhere. Like I spent 19 on fast tracking 1 Coco tree while I have Tom for 6 days and 102 Coco\'s in my silo then tell me they can\'t refund it because I\'m a liar! They took 50 from my husband and only refunded him 30!! Super cell is ripping players off!!',
       'I buy an axe it will last forever same thing with other tools but here I have to keep buying tools to do the job. An if I need more crop I get the land ready for more seeding get the water. This you have to bring in more people that never show up to do the work. That\'s why if I\'m going to farm I count on one person me. Here you need others. It not for me.',
       'Long time player returning to the game after taking a break. I leveled up to level 41 today. Before leveling up it showed I should get 1 white and 1 black rabbit with the new level but I didn\'t get either of them. I would also like to see it a bit easier to get wildlife refuge animals. 36 puzzle pieces seems a bit much.',
       'Good game. I initially wrote a one star review because this game was very dependant on microtransactions but it\'s actually pretty fun if you have the patience. Right off the bat you have to wait upwards to 30 minutes or an hour for basic production and warming but as you grow your farm it gets easier to deal with. This definitely isn\'t a game you can play for, like, an hour, consecutively, which kinda sucks but it\'s great for the 10-20 minites you pop in now and then.',
       'It is an amazing game. Our entire family is hooked and i love the idea of neighbourhood chat on hay day it is awesome!!! Continue making this game as cool as it is👍. However it would be nice to have private chat on hayday where the entire neighbourhood does not see your conversation. There is also a glitch where i cannot open my daily videos.' ],

The developer\'s must be building their apps with personal touches.  I get the sense of one on one attention during play and think to myself...No it\'s an app silly!  Of course it shows best in the generous bonuses and free chips.  This game is BIG fun.  I am sure Slotomania will continue to thrill all who play here!!',

     [ 'Very addictive. I started playing casually, and 4 weeks later I find myself checking it all the time. It\'s best played with at least a minor investment, but reasonably ftp...if you got patience.  Add: it\'s been six months, and I\'m still hammering away at it. It has a huge base of fans,and I\'ve only needed customer support once (and they handled my issue very well and quickly).  Still a bit grind-y, but great little bit of clicky gaming.',
       'Good game but be warned to really get any good characters you\'re either going to have to pay lots of real money or you\'ll find yourself grinding forever the same nodes to upgrade the characters that you have. With that said this game is a big improvement over heroes of dragon age of which in many ways this game is modeled after . It seems very clear that some of the devs from that game migrated to this game to start it up. The last update at 02-26-18 freezes at loading screen and then force closes come on devs get on this!',
       'I love this game but an issue im having since the newest update os why im giving 2 stars at the moment. Ever since the update the game will not load. Says "loading cantina" then closes the app completely. Im gonna end up getting kicked out of my guild...please fix this! Soon as its fixed it will return it to 5 stars bc the overall game is badass!',
       'I played this on and off since it started but now I am back full-time and it has always been improving and growing. Big star wars fan and can\'t get enough of it? This is the next best thing. The game is very complex so I suggest if you are only starting out, check out starter guides on youtube on how to have the best head start  and enjoy! 🎉',
       'Really good game. I love games where you have to grind to get the best character with a slight bit of luck if you pull them. The only thing i would change is how long it takes to get your energy back as. I feel like when i run out i cant play the game gor a long time as it takes a lot of time to get your energy back. But overall would fully recommend',
       'The game is fun enough but to sync it with your Google account to have to give your phone and all its abilities to EA. Why is there a need for the game to access my photos and make and answer calls? How \'bout I play a game on my phone with cool light sabers and fun music and when I need to make a call I\'ll stop for a bit. Just let people play and EA can make bank with their microtransactions. GTFO of people\'s personal info.' ],

     [ 'Definitely pay to win. When you scroll up or down it thinks you are clicking on something. Stamina is a nightmare as when you reach a high enough level that takes more xp to level up, you can\'t play for hours as it takes to long to recharge. Should make gems easier to get for non paying players so it is more fair. Other than that pretty good.',
       'One of the few games that I don\'t mind spending a bit i.e. $10+ every month. Requires team guild effort to achieve stuffs together definitely gives a good feeling. Event is weekly and community is lively. Card\'s artwork feels like Rage of Bahamut but using matching puzzle style to deal damage. Skills of card matter as well increasing the complexity and fun. Only thing to improve would be cheaper ingame currency to encourage more people to have better decks thus higher activity rates.',
       'It\'s a lot other games of this type. I haven\'t been able to find a problem with it yet. Great graphics although the timer is a bit fast when you\'re looking up connections. If you had a button that the players would push when they couldn\'t find any more connections, that would be great!',

       'Its a match 3, pay to win game with heroes. Its pay to win lootbox style pay to win mechanics enures that unless you are extremely lucky or9 intend to pay alot, you wouldnt win jack. The match 3 RNG can also make the game infuriating, such as when there is little to no matches or the matches are for colors which yohr team doesnt have. However, unlike other match 3 games, it is fun for longer.',
       'Number one of the best games I have ever played on my phone. I\'m watching ads for bonus experience when sacrificing my cards. And I love the fact of that availability.

But it is fustrating, as players who are reluctant to buy crystals have a much harder time compared to those who do. I am one those gamers who are reluctant to pay money just to get better at a game, so I would like to see some balancing towards these kinds of players. Its a win-win players have a better time, the game gets more attention as players wont give up as easily.',

     [ 'Here is a game that has everything right. You don\'t have to wait too long on stamina, and the game releases its appearance rates. And the devs are generous with giving orbs. The game\'s storyline is compelling and you don\'t have to grind excessively for exp if you upgrade the castle fully. Worth the download. The only frustration I have with this game is when I play the arena on advanced I always get people with the op characters that my team can\'t put a dent in.',
       'This game is lots of fun and feels like fire emblem. Lots to do and more strategy then you\'d expect. Only issue I have is that the pricing structure for orbs and the RNG of summons don\'t make sense. Feels like I can\'t support the game financially even if I wanted to because I know I\'d likely get nothing from any summoning pools I did and even the most expensive orb amount would only let you do a few summoning pools. They are generous with free orbs though.',
       'I really enjoy this game a lot, it\'s fun and captures the best part of the series, but Getting 5 star heroes is becoming impossible, my last 10 hero summons have all been the same 5 or so characters and none were 5 star heroes or new characters that I don\'t have yet. Also I might purchase orbs if they were not so expensive and in useless quantities',
       'Mostly good, but lagged occasionally. The pricing for unlocking potential to a 5 star costs way too many feathers. I feel if you could purchase feathers, then the pricing would seem a bit more fair, though a better solution would be to either slightly lower the amount needed or slightly raise the amount earned from things other than arena and events',
       'The game runs unbelievably smoothly on my phone and is utterly addicting. I find myself investing anywhere from a few minutes to multiple hours into the game. It\'s a game with a good story and good gameplay to keep you intrigued for a while; though I\'m still looking for ways to get more gems...',
       'It\'s fun to pick up and play but limits of 10 teams of 4 ruins replayability considering how many playable characters there are. It\'s tedious swapping characters in and out, especially when you have spent time levelling some over others.  Having an unlimited amount of teams or increasing the number of members per team would be very welcome. Otherwise, having so many characters left unused or having to sell is a big miss.' ],

     [ 'I kind of enjoy the game but would like it more if there were cheaper options to buying. After you buy some the prices jump to 99.99 and have yet to see cheaper prices. I\'m not unloading that in one go. The people of this game would probably make more money if they bring cheaper prices. I would buy several different little packs that eventually add up to 100 bit you ain\'t getting nothing otherwise. Also wish you could buy more things with the gold you purchased. Like have a choice to spend loyalty or gold',
       'I started this game when it first came out. There were hardly any game advantages and everyone was having fun and on the same playing field. As more and more packages got released into the game it became a pay to win situation. I personally do not think spending $100+ on a phone game is a wise investment. Thus I enjoyed the game by taking advantage of their events and the prizes within the game. However, it has become dominated by people who payed to be the big guy and the little people get absolutely demolished. It has taken the fun out of playing, which really dissapoints me as it was a fun game to play.',
       'This game has potential to be fun but it\'s completely ruined because IT\'S COMPLETELY PAY-TO-WIN which sucked the fun out of the game that I quit. Don\'t get me wrong, Final Fantasy is highly respected RPG franchise because it\'s full of great games in the series. But no this one.  However, I might come back if the game developers make it not as pay-to-win as it is now. Right now, it\'s a complete money bucket!',
       'This game is great and fun, I love spending my time playing this game. One problem though, what is going on with the packages? Why is it every time a package is bought all the packages go from 20 to 100 dollars ? We should be able to buy the 20 dollar packages more than once! Is that fixable? Please cuz i do want to keep playing but 100 dollars is too much.',
       'The game is very addictive and fun to play. Some of the people playing the game are wonderful and fun to game with. Graphics are very good for a on line game played on phone, tablet or computer. The quests are challenging at best. BUT!!! BE WARNED... This game is not for young children as there is explicit language and cut throat people playing the game. After all it is a war game and nothing more. Now down to the nitty-gritty of the game. Yes it\'s free, but that only get you so far before you will need to buy packs in the game to advance and unlock the two new characters. The game quests are designed for people to spend if you want to get ahead fast. Large amounts of  $$$$$$ Cash are needed to play this game. $$$$$$ Personal note, I know people who have spent thousands on this game. Over all the game is great for young adults on up. PG-15',
       'I absolutely LOVE my guild!!! Everyone is so cool,from all over the States & all over the world...have friends in other guilds as well from all over the world...my guild is like my "family"...some of us have even talked about meeting up with each other...I hope to finally meet some of my favorite people,especially our guild leader...we\'re like the best of friends!!! Although,he lives in TX & I\'m from Michigan,we\'re both married ,but there\'s nothing I wouldn\'t do for him!!! Thanks so much for giving me this opportunity to meet such wonderful people!! Lifelong friends/family!!! 💜' ],

     [ 'I don\'t think I need to \'review\' much here. There are some points I definitely don\'t like about the game. Such as the matchmaking... You get matched with the same deck type in a row. Other than that and some minor flaws it\'s a great game. I love the competitive aspect about it.  Finally I would suggest some 2v2 with different game modes, such as ramp up 2v2. Also, add the rematch button in 2v2 challenges with random mates.  Hope I hit the 4,3k this season. Good luck to all clashers!',
       'I think Clash Royale is a great game to play and is very well put together for all ages, it is a fast paced game and at the same time can be played with an individual pace of your own to a degree being that there is a clock ticking, also new characters are released at a well balanced rate, so that the game doesn\'t become boring and the regular balance of the characters strengths and weaknesses are balanced to make the game more competitive. I recommend this game for all ages and abilities. It\'s great for a few minutes or an hour or so and this game also has several different tournaments you can enjoy yourself or with a friend or a teammate. See you soon on Clash Royale. A.K.A. Dad.',
       'This is  the best game ever. And supercell, can u add google + sign in so that people who don\'t use facebook can also have friends.. Also I have like 8 leggie right now and I am so happy. And the new clan battle is awesome, it is the best. I wish it is permanent. Anyways clan battle is so fun to play and who ever created it.. U r awesome. Keep up the good work Supercell. Love you so much and ur games.😙😙😙❤❤❤❤😀😁😁😊😊😊',
       'Supercell, I think your best game is hay day. Clash royale on the other hand isn\'t one of your better games. Android is better than apple. Why would you ever support apple instead of android. You released Brawl Stars only for apple. You should have less medieval/fantasy games unless you make the knights, princes etc. More realistic. In my opinion I think you\'re better at making farm and army games. Please make more of those😖',
       'This is the only game of its kind. Many companies try to copy, but this is the original and the best. There are  endless possibilities of card combos and decks that you could use making the game always entertaining. My only complaint is that the trainer is way too easy to beat. It is one of few games that you could get competitive without using your own 💰. I also like how the stuff that u unlock in the beginning does not go to waste later in the game.',
       'What do we do?  I have been playing this game from 9 months now. In these 9 months i got 3 Legendary Cards 2 from chest and 1 from Clan Chest. But the thing is that all of them were Ice Wizard. I\'m in Arena 9 from 2 months now Because i dont have the cards to win. I check the tv royale every time i open the Game for a good deck But. So Supercell tell me what do i do? I can\'t push to Hog Mountain then what do i do in this game? Please do something' ],

     [ 'Well, I loved the looks of it. Seemed really fun so I downloaded it. Then I spent 30 min downloading the patches, to find out at the very end I didnt have enough space on my phone. Uninstalled as much as I could, and still didn\'t have enough space... Could have said in details of the game how much space it REALLY takes up... Would have been really nice to know.  -a not so happy consumer',
       'So, far really love to play. I only just started though. The controls are hard but that\'s probably because I\'m playing on a tablet and I got small hands. Unfortunately, I don\'t think I\'ll be able to continue playing this. For some reason it makes my tablet terrifyingly hot to the point I\'m concerned. I\'ll hold on to the app for now in case it gets better in the future.',
       'An amazing mmo that really does a great job of handling farming, the game play although has an auto feature still utilizes the controls. The depth of all the items and armor and weapons is awesome. I\'ve been really happy playing this game. The clans are great. The 30 vs 30 opensiege is a nice feature. This game is super fun even for the people that want to play for free. Netmarble does a great job with daily rewards, login bonuses, and events that all allow for players to get great items for free!! Best game I\'ve played in a long while. Only thing is constant crashes and bad story line. The game keeps me turning it back on and I haven\'t went one day without logging in.',
       'Addicting game with auto-questing and battling. You can choose to do it manually, which I do for boss fights. I don\'t have to buy anything from the shop, in fact, you get free gear every day! The graphics are amazing for a mobile game with it being an MMO. I have a Note 8, so it does run really well. I play with my monitor using SideSync for full screen awesomeness. There is a lot to do for all types of players, being in a guild doing dungeons reminds me of the old-school MMORPGs of sieging and doing weekly raids.',
       'The game had me hooked as I spent a week trying to find a character and job class I liked. Keep in mind that you will be doing a lot of grinding, but leveling is not surprisingly unreasonable.  There are some aspects that will make you believe you have to pay to win, but it is not necessary. Although it would be cool to help the devs or too. All in all love the game and can\'t seem to put it down ( I let it auto-grind while I live my life. Haha).',
       'Everything about this game is really good, but since this update today I can\'t even open the game it keeps closes and sending me to my home screen on my phone... Doesn\'t give me a error report or any messages just closes the app. Id really like to continue playing please fix . Galaxy S8+' ],

Sent off request to support a number of times with proof and no reply, and after a week still no reward.   So if you are downloading this to get reward from another app don\'t bother as you won\'t get it',
       'I like the game but it is hard for players who can\'t buy a lot of packs. Some slight tweaks to make it not so slanted towards big spenders.  Maybe make some exchange rate for silver to gold without changing the silver availability or price. Someway that gold can be acquired beside the little in the ground. I understand the game has to make a profit and so you should but more people would continue to play instead of giving up Anyway just a couple of thoughts. Got plenty more on just general gameplay  that I think would be useful. Again, not hating as I like and play the game.',
       'Pure pay tto win. You will either pay or quit out of frustration. Build times are hilarious. Seriously, our Earth\'s sun will die before you max out your hero\'s knowledge or most any other knowledge.  The Stronghold is worthless and a huge waste of resources. It\'s more of a trophy.  Sure you can join a clan, get some bonuses and buy some shields with points, but you will be destroyed by the winners. Me, I had a gift card and blew on this game, now I just start fights and make people quit.',
       'Waste of time. I started playing the game as an offer to get points for another game. Vikings is not a bad game on itself but I feel cheated when I\'m promised something and IronSource does not honor their part of the bargain. IronSource said the Plarium did not verify my completion of the offer, so I won\'t play it anymore nor try other Plarium content nor IronSource advertised games. The actual content is fine, but the business practices are deplorable.',
       'Great time killer, I love the interaction and concept of the game. It can get a bit laggy at times and at it\'s worst, it will crash on you. The wait times are unbearable though. No ads at all since the first time I played too!',
       'Too late to join this game. As soon as you lose your newbie protection you become a farm for higher level players, preventing you from progressing. Every morning you find all your resources pillaged and your troops dead or incapacitated. Maybe I\'m just in the wrong timezone.' ],

     [ 'Cross platform across Apple and Android and PC makes this game a fluid joy to play, without the feeling of a toned down mobile port - due to its 1:1 experience from the PC. It\'s the only Blizzard game u can play on Mobile. I\'m a legend (highest skill tier) ranked and totally F2P so the people who say this game is pay to win or random luck do not understand the game. Paying for is meant for helping you finish your collection fast. Overall highly recommended.',
       'Lots of fun over and over again. It doesn\'t get boring because of all the expansion updates that keep coming up. You need to readjust your decks to adapt with the new cards that get released. Didn\'t give it a full 5 because of the lag and graphic issues that keep coming up for me and others of the forums.               Playing on a Note 5',

But it just makes me do the tutorial and after I completed it, it just keeps on doing the starter stuff.

I\'m not sure its a glitche or I\'m doing something wrong but It just wont let me log in my account.',

This game is boring and is lagging so much on the cellphone. Shadowverse is ways better for a similar formula, has a really good storyline and a waaaaay more generous. When you buy card for HS you get mostly nothing. They had the chance to do something good, everyone love the lore of warcraft, but they BS it.',
       'What the hell? I played this game about 2-3 years ago and i really liked it (on that time). But now when i came back I just can\'t win anyone. I tried to win on rank 25 about 10 times. There always players with full deck of legendary/epic cards, 25 RANK, DAMN!',

Also, I like the items and clothing on the catalog, so that you can change your avatar - remember, you need to pay for the clothing with robux! If people call you noobs, don\'t listen to them. Just be yourself. There are some bullies of there: just stay away from them :D',

However, even though this game is made for all ages the filter can prevent lots of messages of such that not only are innocent, but friendly messages. I recommend this app for younger children under 10. Overall ok app.',

     [ 'I have been playing for a while now, I like almost all of the game, not too impressed that "the piggy bank " is basically held to ransom until you buy it... find another way to entice spending... reduce number of coins won or something but as the levels get hard if you dont spend money you get stuck even with team helps.. it gets disheartening and reduces interest after a while.. to the gamemakers: keep the game playable..the money will come',
       'Update...as I go though the levels Ill get stuck for a day or two...even 3 on a level. Gameplay FUN has Dropped significantly. Moved to 3 stars as a result. If it does not change I\'ll continue to move to 1 star. Games are many to be played...not just stuck on a level forever!  Other issue with the game is that there\'s so much clicking and waiting once you win. I wish that it would just go right to the next level and it wouldn\'t have to wait for the splash screen. I just spend so much time wasted versus playing',

The only way I could figure out the pass that level was to use the things at the bottom of the screen or the things the page where you choose what you want to put in there in advance. But if you don\'t buy extra coins then you can\'t either had moves or get anything that will help you along. Not to mention that 100 coins per item is a lot of money. When you charge $2 450 coins. I\'m taking this game off my apps.' ],

       'This is a wonderful, well made, fun game!  Also highly addictive.    Really enjoy it a lot.      With that said, the biggest downside, IMO, is that rewards are few, & far between, and there is no way to get gold bars without paying for them.  These become rather needed the further you get and for certain individual, and more difficult, "puzzles".  It can become too expensive to play (if one really want to get somewhere in this game).',
       'Why does this game keep freezing during play. I know this game has been on the play store for a long time now because I played it a year ago non-stop but now it is freezing. Come on dev\'s u have had plenty of time to work out the kinks. It shouldn\'t be freezing in the middle of play. Shame on u king dev\'s.',
       'I love the game, but i liked it more when the piggy bank had 100 gold bars. It was a fair price-amount report. Also, i would love to see more often the trick or treat and the win 14 challanges event. And yes, the new owl look is awful. Please change it back :-))' ],

     [ 'So far, I dig this game. Although, the individuality of it is scarce. I still play it and enjoy it. It\'s not identical to other games of this type, as the challenges are similar yet different. The scenario of the game is basic with the others. I have a variety when it comes to games, this one has similar sound affects to other games that I, personally, downloaded. (But they\'re also from the same makers.) This game is over all.... Good so far.. I would recommend, linked my account to this game and invited friends and family. (I only do so, if the game/app is worthy. I\'m a picky bull!!!!) Overall, you\'ll have fun! Cute toys and  unique power ups, with a slightly (10%) twist.',
       'Definitely addicting. The levels are challenging, the tools are fun to figure out and the reward set up is not unattainable. The only other thing is they grew more wise  for the latest update, you can\'t change the time on your phone to add lives anymore! Probably better that way, one (read: I) should pace themselves when playing....',
       'This is by far the most fun I\'ve  had with a game app! Its so cute and  colorful!  And each increase in difficulty  makes you want to keep coming back for the next challenge.  What also makes it awesome  is a no brainer,  its great for children and adults alike.  BIG THUMBS UP!',
       'Really enjoyed the game until I was entered in a two week tournament.  Now, the boards are incredibly difficult and I can no longer earn prizes on a regular basis. Of course, I suppose that\'s by design so I spend money. Which I won\'t do. I just want some "bubblegum" to past the time.  Now, it\'s making my blood pressure rise...  Also amazing how many 5 ⭐ ratings they get in one day without the user giving explanations on why. Seems suspicious...',
       'I  love this game but why does it take 30 minutes for a life to refill and also why does everyone who plays the game not receive ten lives only some of your players this needs to be fixed it\'s not fair I\'ve been playing for years and only receive five lives at a time when others receive ten lives.I play other games and the lives refill every 7 to 15 minutes. Can you please make changes',
       'Nice game challenging to think ahead. But, basically this game is cheating on you. Levels are far too difficult to complete without boosters. So, after failing several times the not so random appearing tiles give you a lot of boosters. That prevents to uninstall (at least until you master the highest level and you enter the Legends Arena) !' ],

IGG is still unbelievably money hungry for their newest released things - but I guess it\'s better to wait for everything or pay for it upfront. I chose option 1.

     [ 'Hey supercell,no doubt your game is awesome but I didn\'t like the supercell id technique in the new update...why did u removed the Google play login system? It was easier to change coc account in it...but in the supercell id it takes a lot of time to change the accounts plus we have to write our email then wait for the password....please fix this issue..... Probably I m not the only one who is facing it......    So I hope that your team can fix this issue..',
       'This is a very good game and I highly recommend it but there are two small changes I would make.    1) I would make it so that you can move the object in your village i.e. trees, rocks as there are afew seasonal decoration that I would like to keep but they are getting in the way of my village.    2) I would also make it so that you can put more then 1 builder on a construction to cut down its time or add more builder.    But other then them 2 changes I think it\'s a great game and I\'ve had lots of fun with it.',
       'The heroes should be for all players from the lower level. They can make their own choice to choose the hero or switch them. If you provide the better or strongest hero for the strong one, it means the stronger is still the better and even the best. The weaker will have no choice,  but accepting the unfair attack from those strong ones. Please think about it again. Be fair for all players. Otherwise, the stronger or the best ones are still the stronger and the best ones. How about the weak ones? Do they have a chance to use their strategy? It\'s the strategy game, not for only the big or strong players. Thanks!!...',
       'Super game my favourite game really nice guys download it .I have A small request if we have got any bonus in war or Multiple battles it automatically goes in Clan Castle ,and when we want withdraw it give whole treasure comes out. So if U keep a device ,in which we can type how much  amount of  treasure we want to withdraw. It will be great honor if U put it in next update.',
       'It is a good family game and it is a way to play with lots of friends and even make some new friends in your clan. It does not take lots of money to complete they game it only takes skill and dedication. I have played this game for years and have had many different accounts on it, but you just have to dedicate your self to one on those accounts to get a good high level account',
       'Its an awesome game. The new concept of supercell id is cool but switching is little time taking. I Would request you guys to make it easier or add some shortcut to switch accounts. Because it is really difficult to change if you are in poor network zone. Plz consider this. Otherwise the concept is really good it saves RAM of phone as u dnt need play games and services updated. 😀' ],

     [ 'It is  great game, for ages 10 and up even 9 is okay. It is cool that we are building a town from scratch, like from the prehistoric time, and building our way up. Not like other game that start you off with big present day buildings. It doesn\'t cost a lot to do things like building and removing things, some object are free, they give the right amount of money and you can always win some more diamonds. In other games you would have to pay to remove object and buildings are ridiculously expensive.  It is hard to make money in other games and to make diamonds. I personally at night put my hunters too make things that take 8 hours and in the day things that take 5 to 15 minutes but sometimes 1hour. It is a very good game, it is almost as a real life city town, empire.',
       'Although FoE is very enjoyable, it can get very complicated, especially for new players. The biggest drawback is the lack of instructions...new players, unless taken under the wing of an experienced player, have to fumble through at first, many times guessing or using trial and error to accomplish the simplest things.',
       'At first I was a little unhappy with the amount of stuff I can do with spending diamonds, but I now find it refreshing, not to spend active hours on a game in order to receive a reward. I\'m glad they reward patience.',
       'This is a really good solid game that you can play at your own rate. You don\'t need to spend money and someone can\'t attack and wipe you out in a night. Many faceted play that will keep you busy and entertained from start until......well, ever I guess.',
       'Loving the game so far customer support helped me out quickly when I needed help this game is a fun mix between city building and fighting I\'m enjoying the game if you like this one Elvenar is just as good it\'s made by the same developers',
       'It\'s,........AMAZING I LOVE IT RATE IT FIVE STARS BUT THE  problem is that I got 50 diamonds and the story said research the pottery but I need 100 more that equals 150 diamonds so I need more diamondsBUT I LOVE IT ITS THE BEST GAME!' ],

     [ 'Alright, I was experiencing bugs before but now they are fixed, thank you. But my other problem is now that when you get things with gold in the game it always takes away more gold than it was priced at, this usually happens on the hero wheel because once it took 213 away from me when I opened ONCE. And the hero wheel is always gives me things I don\'t want since I have opened it about 20 times',

       'Do not waste your money people...the game has a cheat that will not allow fair fight between the sitting king and the opposing king and the sitting king will never lose.   Game is very unfair and a waste of money.   I am searching for new game to spend my money on',
       'The game has terrible bias towards the Asian markets and worse of all is the ignoring of cheating. Accounts have been hacked and deleted with evidence submitted and little or no support from the game.   Already you need to pay to get the best results but worthless if cheats can hack and undo your hard work or money spent.',

Alot of game content is not usable on the computer game via FB .. Rewards and such can only be collected on mobil app. And some content is there but don\'t work on computer.',
       'Overall the game is pretty good and is a great time killer. It\'s really laggy after it loads. Which really screws me sometimes when I get attacked. Also recent bug came up where it won\'t show the daily event anymore.

       'Had trouble restarting sit and go. Returning to lobby and reentering addressed problem. Pretty good app. Challenges are obviously based on bankroll making it more of a player\'s game instead of a winner\'s game because poker is not a winner\'s game. Long play on shootout can be annoying but why you buying in at 2k? You get to play daily if you like to play for free and can even complete challenges when you went bust.',
       'Expect to see a flush 35% of the time. This is so unrealistic. Watch out for bots. Do not download. If you contact support they just send out a form email stating that "Help is on the way..." but they will not fix the issue of bots. They deny that bots are exploiting their app but when told of evidence, they send a form letter denying the existence of bots. They still have not stopped the bots from ruining the fun of trying to advance to higher leagues because they allow bots to exist on their app.',

     [ 'I never write reviews, but this game really deserves a high one. I got this game because my friend Emily adores it, and I have been playing NON STOP. It\'s so beautiful and high quality for just a dress up game. It\'s absolutely wonderful. My favorite thing is that you can really enjoy the game without having to use real money on in app purchases. Yeah, you can if you want to, but your experience isn\'t less if you don\'t. A high quality and fun game. I adore it',
       'As much as I really love the artwork and gameplay, there is still an issue: can you please make all of the current and future makeups compatible with all skin tones? It\'s not really fair for those who aren\'t of pale skin. Thank you for all the progress and work made so far, & I really hope that there\'s a way you can make this happen. Thanks!   (I would give a full five stars if everyone could have equal ability to wear different makeups)',
       'I never write reviews, but this game deserves all the praise possible. Downloaded it for my niece and turns out I am the one addicted!! I\'m a daily player now and love the fact that you can start your own group for 300 gems and approve applications and interact with your stylist association members. That aspect took the game to a whole new level. The clothing is beautiful and the attention to detail is great!!! Give it a shot and you just may become addicted like myself. I do spend around 20 bucks a week, but it was just as much fun before I was spending money, I just wanted the special clothes for events.',
       'In depth in both gameplay and attention to details of awarded items. Continuous hours not required but with once a day of incentive activities. Controls are  sometimes unstable. If a glitch does happen, its fixed fast and your also awarded for time spent. Very happy customer. Enjoyed the best dress up game I\'ve played so far. Thank you makers!',
       'I\'ve been playing this game for about 5 months now, it has amazing graphics and wonderful gameplay. My only problem with it is a lot of the times its very difficult to obtain the events suits. I feel like the only way for you to complete a suit is to spend some sort of cash. I get that you have to make an earning but it just makes the game annoying to play. I would also like more skin tone options and would like the makeup to be compatible. Anyways thank you for creating a wonderful game.',
       'Lovely game! Gorgeous clothes and gameplay. A little cheesy in. The story but fairly creative for a dress up game. Plus it can be hilarious with how wild the lore gets around fashion. Design can be a little overcrowded sometimes but everything is coordinated so it still looks nice. Backgrounds are gorgeously painted. Tutorial is easy to understand but isnt too tedious. I am officially addicted' ],

     [ 'With an easy guide, on \'How to play\'. Once you get going its great fun. Dare I say quite addictive. Fantastic animations. Amazing back ground music. Plus, no app freezes either.  Its an \'A☆\' from me at least.  Only, what would be a great idea. Is all the piggy bank jewels you build up, should be awarded for your hard efforts. Should not have to buy them back.  Only purchase jewels when desperate.',
       'Ok.....we need an aquarium just for the holiday\'s.  I cleaned out one aquarium and that\'s all I have in there is the holidays.  After this session I\'ll probably save one just for Christmas itself.  Love the unlimited times! Keep the surprises coming!! I don\'t like so many clocks in one game and the "timed" games are insane! It is definitely challenging.  I play several times a day if possible.',
       'Great game but would love it more if it kept track of when you bought something . Like a little quantity number in the corner after you purchase a fish or decorations. Hard to save up to buy things for guests, sucks when you buy something you already have when trying to complete a task. Other then that it\'s a great game lol I enjoy playing it.',
       'Great game. Challenging, fun, and addictive lol. I\'m 32 and play this often so it\'s not just for kids . Give it a try it\'s very satisfying . Just wished you could add friends ... People that play whom you may not know so we all could help each other. That would make it more interactive and a lot more fun. No one I know plays so it would have to be other fellow fishermen 😉',
       'Fantastic game! It\'s great fun decorating the aqariums and the game board is very clear. The recent move of the boosters to the right hand side of the screen was a VERY bad decision, as I have accidentally used them when my hand has brushed against them - this has happened many times already. A good addition would be a marker indicating a purchased item.',
       'Because you only get 5 lives and you make some levels with too few moves. It would be nice if you could interact more with your fish and tanks. The whole point of beating levels is to build up your tanks...but you can\'t do anything with them while waiting for lives. It would be a fantastic game if there was more to do within the tanks!' ],

     [ 'This game needs the ability to gain more township cash. I have spent way too much real money to buy township cash and im not doing so again at this rate. Farmville isnt this bad and hard to expand.  You cant expand the barn without waiting on products by train or paying in township cash to expand. And that costs over a couple hundred township cash for each expansion. Getting a dollar or two here and there takes forever to collect. Plus the expansion makes small expansions so it doesnt help much.   If something dont change i may quit the game. I enjoy it and would like to continue but at this rate i dont see much point. I cant afford to pay more money to play.',
       'The VERY best game EVER..so fast to level up... Never boring.. Always SO much to do!!! ... it NEVER asks 4 money !!!!!!   NO pop ups or commercials. !!!. . the inventors are genius... i Love this game..  thank you for making this game.. Graphics are Amazing!!!   Best farming game ...Bonus Zoo !!!...and breed ur animals ADORABLE BABIES.. with a splash of Cityville  ..Gold digging..making ingots to use...  So many optional tournaments if u want to win more money n prizes in the Regattas... Township friends make it SO much easier n fast 4 everyone  .. and so much more You just HAVE TO Try TOWNSHIP ❣💞',
       'The Best!  But not Great my suggestion is please add an option to chat your friends privately this is important!.  Also add an option to search anyone by their township name so we can easily adding them.. Last one add an option to change your profiles photo from our gallery if you can~ instead of using our Facebook photos or township original photos.. Please make it happen',
       'Great game very addictive, and I don\'t know if I just found the right Co-op or what but the team work on this game is amazing. I love my little town although, 😒 you need to be able to expand faster! I have NO ROOM for any more buildings, and they want me to expand my population so I can add more buildings. Thats\'s kind of ridiculous. That\'s the only bad thing I have to say about this game.',
       'BEST GAME EVER! It\'s my biggest game but even though I have an old phone the game still runs really smoothly. There\'s always something to do, it never gets boring. I\'ve been playing for 8 months. Super easy to use and learn. It\'s addictive. You also don\'t feel pressured to make purchases like other games.',
       'I\'m not a game player, but this game is a lot of fun, AND, you never have to spend a dime! Of course, unless you want to spend money!  I do wish the direction went into a little more depth. It would make it a little easier for new people to understand the extra things, like the snow boarding and the regatta.' ],

     [ 'All i see is language i cant understand from the chatting menu. Can you make an auto translattor so other people can understand each other. Even all the member of the house use chinese, brazilian, its better if all language translate according the language we choose in game from the option',
       'A great game and extremely addictive once you really get into it. Well thought out. It can be very time consuming but that is what makes it great. The grind to level up Heroes makes me want to come back and carry on, unlock other heroes and further upgrade my Kingdom. My only issue is the fact that resources are hardly able to be kept. Being under constant attack from other groups and unable to allow my Kingdoms walls to regenerate properly before I am able to move again seems to be a recurring issue and one I do feel needs to be looked at and tweaked. Nonetheless, I\'m impressed with the game. Continue with the good updates and this game could be one of the best mobile games out there.',
       'This game is destroyed by money. Every realm has at least one player who spends thousands of dollars and just skews the gameplay away from a fair contest. Wouldn\'t hesitate to give a 5 if there was a cap on spending',
       'Made for Chinese people only. Only 1 or 2 kingdoms are strong others are suffering Everytime. You will see all Chinese on top where ever you go. No chances of getting higher rank or position as it\'s under control of few players only. You can\'t make some special troops without a position of Duke or Prince.',
       'The game was pretty nice, all the ones who are speaking different kind of language they can as well translate, but there is one problem. I can\'t edit the message for the clan, i wonder if it is a bug or not. Once i became lord of a clan because a former lord turn me into a lord then he said to me to edit the message of the box. I tried to edit then it cannot edit, pls. fix this problem',
       'Great game.... but Chinese ruining it. The play to win is out of control and the Chinese have a pay advantage. They are ultra-nationalistic and team up against \'foreigners\'. They need to have their own servers.' ],

     [ 'I enjoy this game a lot for their variety of games. I will say the starting bonus is very generous. The clubs are fun if you find a good one to be a part of. My only issue is the payout system... It seems when you make a decent win, your chances of winning anything are greatly reduced for a period of time,on any game or slots. No jackpot yet. The ads are not bad.. At all. I won\'t give up.. And I\'m not the only one who notices the payout system.. I won\'t put my own money into this game just yet.. And if I run out I\'ll uninstall. But definitely give this one a try if ur looking for a good Casino Game.',
       'This game is very well choreographed. I like the theme music it plays . I like the fact that it give lots of hi winnings. The backgrounds are nicely colored. Very  adictive games. My favorite"ZEUS SLOTS". Not fair, I\'m not getting some of my winnings. I will take off a star for that. But I still love this game. Although I have been playing this game for a while, and it has improved alot. Now my favorite games are HERCULES, THE MUMMY, and the DIAMONDS SLOTS, and the FRUIT SLOTS. Now I LOVE this game. Some of the game slots needs to up beat the music. Some games are slow, sleepy music. I have always loved this game. Its a lot of fun. It keeps me motivated. My newest favorite game yet is" WILD STARS"  . However, "ZEUS" I feel that it need to update its amount of pay. And add different characters and music. Love the action😄. This is always an exciting game.😉Ah, always an awesome game.😆This is a wonderful game to play when your on vacation. Just awesome. I love this game, exciting wins. This will always be my favorite game.',
       'Enjoyable game, lots of freebies.  I now need to change up my review.i had made a purchase in the game during a "Spin and Win" promotion, that purchase stated that I would receive 10m chips for every 2k league points, at end of promotion, I did not receive any of my chips as promised per promotion advertising. I followed the process of getting in touch with Huuuge Casino and was told once that someone would be in touch with me, as of this listing I still have not heard back from anyone.',
       'So i liked the game enough to over look the constant in app purchase ads and advertisments that are timed perfectly to get you to accidently tap them. But what just made me uninstall this game was this: Twice now i have hit raise or bet in texas hold em\' and instead the game folds my very obvious winning hand. Whether it is a technical issue or not, i dont care. There are better games out there that dont have this issue, and i suggest you play those instead of this one.  Phone Specs: Galaxy S7, fully updated OS, apps, etc., Verizon service provider.',
       'DO NOT BOTHER  playing this game. IT IS PAY TO PLAY. It used to be a really great game. Have met some really great people. Huge makes constant updates and each time they do, they pay less. People are leaving in droves to go to other games. YOU BLEW IT HUUGE!!',
       'People are losing alot of money in this. This game no fun no more. And all u say are im sorry to hear....blablabla....it is imposibble to win and when we win some we lose a alot. Huuge dont care about our complain as long they make money. More player hurts, more player lose, they just dont care as long peoples make them income. Very very bad game.' ],

     [ 'I recently switched to mobile gaming only, and I have a g stylo phone and a Nvidia shield k1 tablet. On my phone I get network error (I\'m data only) and my tablet says the game isn\'t compatible. It\'s marshmallow OS on the shield tablet and the thing can run borderlands 2 natively so I know it\'s not a hardware issue. This game looks cool. Wish I could find out for sure. And no, I\'m not running a speed test.',
       'The features of the game are cool.. i like all the pvp dungeons.. but most of the dungeons with event goes in certain time and limited.. if i miss them..then i hardly get the purpose of installing this game meaning.. nothing else to do.. it\'s getting boring for player like me who wants to spend hours online but no more rewarding pvp dungeons available overnight.. maybe create some entertaining 24 hours pvp features? I can tell many players tend to be inactive for more than 1 day...so hope for more crowded and better LOD..',
       'I just realized this evening that this game uses the microphone feature to spy on the players and listen to their conversations without their consent. After joining one event I could clearly hear conversations of other players (not about game and I\'m sure without them even knowing that they were being listened to) while I was having my sound turned off, even after leaving that particular event and when having my game in the background the sounds didn\'t stop until I turned off the game. This game should be called Legacy of Spies, nice try 👍🏻',
       'Love the game, would give 5 stars, but lost 2 high-level characters and quite a bit of $ due to lack of anything resembling customer service. If you have to reinstall for any reason, and can\'t remember your password, be prepared to lose all progress because if you can\'t sign in right the first time, there\'s no way to sign out, or to contact someone to help recover your character.',
       'I love playing the game but there are so many updates all the time. And when they do their bimonthly update you have to download new package and then some gameplay features dont work. I have had a couple things not work from last update. I tried to contact support and they havent replied at all. Its been three days now. Im an everyday player who spends real money in game. Would rate higher if someone would help me out..',
       'I Love the Game itself. But the reason I give 4S only is their Support System. It seems that they dont really care about their Players, And also, The game itself is Great from its Interface to its gaming experience. Its all good, but when new updates comes, the game has Always Bugs, and Developers seems so slow to Fix them.' ],

     [ 'The game is alright. Still too early to give it a proper review. Only here to say that the timers are way too long in the early stages of the game. Waiting an hour or four for thirty seconds of gameplay. They need to work on scaling the progression timers. A game like this is okay with long timers in late game when you have more than one thing to keep track of. But for these pay to win games to be profitable it helps to bait the hook a little harder before making you wait hours for more content.',
       'GG easy. everyone whining being pay to play this that. i never bought anything and I\'m loving this, just need a little patience and you can do many things untill one thing gets done or upgraded. I\'m high in ranks, have a clan dedicated to non buyers. its all cool. been over 4 months and i still play this its amazing! great work guys, keep it up and keep adding new stuff.',
       'I love the game.  The thing is, this game just gets boring.  For example,  all you can do right now is to vanquish invasions. That\'s basically it. The portal is not always open.  The tournament? Well the match ups are way too oblivious.  My in game friends already have started quitting coz of these problems. You have to add something fun soon. Well it is still a fun game tho.',
       'Would be a great game if it wasn\'t blatantly pay to win.  Everything in the game is designed to push you to pay.  I enjoyed it at first and usually toss about $15 since it was decent.   But then, the system pairs you with opponents you can\'t defeat which then hampers your progress greatly which then means you either pay or hope you don\'t get attacked too much and lose all your resources.',
       'Been playing since early access relese. Game is very well built. But like all other games. The ads now bugged. The daily quest for the ad has never worked for me. Starts ad restarts app no credit. Oh well its an ad right. Well now your forcing me to watch them. Please fix So can i atleast finish those 2 daily quest?!?!?!  Also since update my androids menu buttons overlay all buttons on far right/left hand of screen depending on tilt. Phone is an LG stylo 3. Please address and i will rerate later.',
       'Everything is pay to play. The constant need for microtransactions is absurd. $10-$20 at a time. If you don\'t pay, you have to wait days to upgrade resources. If you want to compete, no matter how much you level, you are just under supplied to win, unless you my for resources. Game play is awesome, but setup is garbage.' ],

     [ 'l was enjoying the game a lot and would have given it 5 stars. l spent a long time to get enough bricks to  build a level 7 home so dragons only needed 7 mins sleep.. NOW    only  the same 5 of my 30 dragons get out and this is making collecting bricks and healing power very slow. l have not seen all my green dragons and moon dragons( the hardest workers) for 2 days now. developers please help or l will stop playing. TY.',
       'I would love to give this game 5 stars but 99% of the ground I\'ve uncovered is covered by "treasure chests" and there\'s no way to get rid of them or contact the game makers for help. I\'ve completely run out of space and can\'t play anymore. The chests should disappear after 3 - 5 days if they\'re not opened.',
       'Love this game. Graphics are great and so much to do. Keeps me going for ages. Main concern and the reason I\'ve not rated 5 star is the time it takes to get each token. When some levels take 7 and it takes half a day to fill up it\'s a major pain. Then you do a level that needs 4 and the next also 4 it takes the p*ss. Would be great to have a higher limit without getting charged or for them to fill up quicker. If this was done I would rate 5 star all round.',
       'You can earn a Max amount of 7 chalices at one time, and it takes a long time to re-accumulate chalices (some levels require the max amount of chalices in order to play level), and do not like the timed levels at all. I am on one now, and don\'t even want to play it, as I have run out of time, and it uses chalices up each time I play, and lose. Please remove these, liked the game a lot more before the timed levels were added. Otherwise, love the game.',
       'Playing this game makes me lose track of time. Wish we could buy the dragon egg chests with game coins.  That would be greatly helpful. Please consider this. Also would be great to transfer items from other levels back to the camp, like eggs, flowers, etc. Plz have this feature.Thanks. Plus would help if there was a set button to hit to exit the game. I am finding it takes between a few to about 5 times to hit the back button on my tablet. Plz fix, would make things alot quicker.',
       '2/5 stars because the only way to play the game is by paying! You can either pay to remove "pay to open" boxes or they don\'t go away taking up all your space! It takes 1 hr for your chalices (energy) to refill only 1 and you only get 7. Love the concept of the game and it is very unique but make it so that people can actually play. Get sponsors, play some ads, have the boxes disappear after a certain amount of time, ANYYHING! This is b*lls*it and not everyone has money to throw away on games. Fix it or I keep the rating low.' ],

     [ 'I love this game!! "it helps a lot" with my shopping addiction because I feel like I\'m buying real merchandise. I really enjoy the updates and how you guys added more room to be designed!!!! Also the 2d & 3d option to view products is awesome!! and if your  studying for interior design this is the app for you! I love the voting of others designs, you get to view everyone creativity. I really love how you guys never ask for an rating....like some apps by the 1st go you get popups please rate our app you guys never asked for an rating I choose to. Thanks for getting me addicted :))',
       'I really love this game. I love voting and seeing what other have also come up with. I love that it is really world design where you can actually shop for pieces and not cartoon rubbish. However, I have had a number of issues where the game has had to restart and have even lost diamonds and cash after trying to collecting daily rewards when it re starts, watching endless adds and not receiving rewards for them or downloading other useless games I have no interest in and actually playing them to generate rewards and not receiving them either. These are my only issues with the game. Other than these it would be five stars.',
       'Great application. Very enjoyable. Only complaint wish app had more international design furniture to match the themes and settings. Also need to fix the bug so that the design loading screen appears.  This is the only app that I have to reset my tablet to get my results, since the last update I have had this issue. I have made an inquiry adressing this issue and it still has not been fixed. I have changed my rating because of this issue, once it has been addressed and fixed I may change my opinion.',
       'I love this game.  The only home design game there is. Glad that that they have added items to the shelves more realistic.  Sometimes I feel it is over designed.  I wouldn\'t always add that footstool or bench.  It is also difficult to play without spending money and I cannot afford to do that.  Keys are required to decorate properly (plants, decor) and can take a long time to accumulate.  This is my favourite game though and I will continue to play and patiently wait just do my best with what I have.  I do watch the videos to gain more keys but woe is me...',
       'Great game! Love it! Only voting system is not accurate. I think  designs that not reflecting the theme should not get  5 stars. It would be nice to have experts inside the game who will review designs for THEME and reward those who follow the theme and get great result  in designing. I suggest to  give one point for those who is following theme, and get one point out if someone not. Fairness is important.',
       'Entertaining, enjoyable and inspiring! Brings out  your creativity in utilizing your available resources and in maximizing your limited funds. The game makes you travel around the globe.  Hope to seeing homes from less popular countries. Sad to note that there are times that free diamonds don\'t add up after watching the videos and there are items not found in the warehouse.' ],

       'Minecraft is an intelligent game that I love to play. I think it helps children learn about animals and what real things there are in the world. Minecraft is such a great game and I think you should do more updates and if you could put a Furniture update or furniture mod in the game. That would be great because there are so many fake Furniture mods for Minecraft that don\'t work. I\'ve at least downloaded half of the fake Furniture mods. I love Minecraft forever.💖💘💗',
       'I\'ve got this on my PC, Ps3 and now this, but you could make it better. If you could add redstone items, such as pistons, repeaters, and other things in. Also a food bar, sprinting and crouching. I have found I can\'t use infinite worlds too,  but that could just be me, as I\'m my phone runs on Ice Cream Sandwich. Keep on goind with these games, they are amazing, mojang you are awesome.',
       'It\'s awesome, because it\'s cool because it is MINECRAFT...   But why did you make it compatible with xbox? Now xbox eddition sucks! And you can get the same forty dollar console game for 6 dollars on a phone or tablet! Sorry about the rant, but realy. PLEASE fix Xbox eddition! Where\'s my flying in survival! Why does a chat box exist in XBOX!',
       'Mindcraft is a attractive game. I like how you can get addons. Plus I like how you choose between survival or creative. Please try the game. If you have any problems thats okay. Also I think it is a great time killer. You may play for 15 minutes and it feels like 3. Just try the game out and see if you like it or not. I personally think roblox is better only because it has more games. This is my third favorite game. I hope you do decide to try it. Im guessing that you will like this game even know the update is a little more  difficult. Every update it brings more bricks I like that. But can you make more swords and armour so its more like terraria. Terraria is my second favorite because you have more stuff to do.',

I\'m crying because of this plz make my day and I\'ll give u 5 stars! Again it\'s on my Playstation 3 not minecraft PE!

     [ 'I never had to pay a single cent for this game, and it\'s working out perfectly fine for me. Sure, you can pay for more coins and items to level up quicker - but you can enjoy the game without paying anything. I get raided too but on a fairly acceptable basis. I love this game. Only thing is, I don\'t like my non-responsive faction members and I\'m worried once I leave my faction I couldn\'t join another one. Ah well. That being said, 5 stars for the game.',
       'Game is really good! Currently level 10 & I am doing pretty good. (For what I think) It\'s a fun game to play you can get free coins which makes it more fun and fair for players that can\'t pay for anything, except patience. I do wish it\'ll be easier to level up characters. But it\'s pretty easy. Just so difficult to get more characters to pay for level ups.',
       'This game is a treasure! It has kept me entertained for about 1 year and a half so far! I love the story parts and maps and I want to congratulate the developers! Good job, Nice graphics, Great game. Although, I lost my save file because this game doesn\'t make any easy whatsoever to load save files. Please fix that! Thanks!',
       'Company is a joke. Never play their games. Dont not install this game unless you expect to spend alot of money to even try to be competitive. There is massive amount  of hacking and cheating and support as no ability to help at all. I would never recommend this game to anyone. The cons far out weigh the pros. Scopley does not care about gameplay or its players at all.',
       'No one from the support team will respond. My game was unistalled and reinstall and I lost 2 years worth of data. Can\'t remember sync it and I know scopely can do it for me. I\'ve provided everything they need and still nothing via email or in-game support. Will change my rating if this is sorted',
       'Awesome game based on the comics. The only set back is that I can\'t seem to be able to download the content for the third chapter on the story map. It goes so far into the download and then stops.   I have already uninstalled and reinstalled the game three times. And I have even deleted unused/unwanted files from my phone to free up some extra space, and it hasn\'t made any difference.   I don\'t know what else I can do.' ],

     [ 'I really do love the stories this game offers. I just wish the key and diamond system was better. I feel like I\'ve purposely passed up some great stories just to play through them quickly so I could get back to the current story I\'m really hooked on. Not to mention I\'ve put money into the game as well. But being on a budget, I\'m limited with what I can do. Sadly I think that is what will eventually make me stop playing such a great game. It\'s just too expensive in the end.',
       'I love this app! I just wish you could collect more than 2 keys at a time. Sometimes the chapters feel short and to only be able to accumulate 2 keys feels like its not enough. 3 to 5 would be way better! Its already a bummer to not have enough diamonds to unlock cool stuff. (unless you want to pay more.. Not everyone has money to spend on phone app games)',
       'I actually really like this game. It\'s fun, it\'s time killing, all that good stuff. But the diamonds are what really kill it.  You get one free diamond at the end of every chapter, which would be nice if it didn\'t cost 25+ diamonds to make a choice. So to get all the options required to have a truly full game play experiance you must buy the diamonds, which also wouldn\'t be a problem if they didn\'t cost so much. (For 5 dollars you get 60 diamonds which is ruffly 2 choices and really they should be lasting longer then that.) There isn\'t even the option to watch an add for more diamonds. Buying them is the only choice if you want to have those certain experiances. I understand that the company has to make money, I really do, but charging out the ass for something is not the way to do it. In short, I would love this game if it didn\'t cost an arm and a leg to play.',
       'Addicting, but the makers are greedy. You have to spend money if you really want to play. Unrealistic cost of diamonds, you get one per chapter but it costs 30 diamond to get the dress or 25 diamonds to go with your friends. Give more options to get more faster. Illbwatch adds or rate things to get more diamonds.',
       'I love it the most exciting story lines. I need you to write one more book about  Love Hacks it just ended suddenly. I have to know what happened to everyone if some of the other couples got married, had kids. Is some characters just single forever. YOU HAVE TO DO THIS SERIES JUSTICE. I FEEL SO HEARTBROKEN.',
       'Everything\'s smooth. Except the keys and diamond. It took so long to get a single key and it would be better if the choices will only cost 1diamond since you only give us 1diamond each chapter. Please update and think about it. Read ur feedbacks we all say the same thing!!! Please' ],

     [ 'It\'s a pretty amazing game, like league of legends but what makes it amazing is that you can play it on your phone. The only problem is the prices of the heroes and skins. Most of the heroes are 32k battle points.. So it would be fair if it was at least 5k cheaper than that. Also the game lags sometimes which interups gameplay which can cause you to unexpectedly die.  For anyone who is reading this, I highly recommend this game to anyone.  It\'s amazing and extremely addictive!!',
       'I think this game is great! I play It Almost Everyday And My Mum Always Has To Scold Me For Playing Too Much! Its Addictive And Fun To Play! Just A Few Things You Guys Could Work On. 1)I Hope That You Guys Will Let Us BE ABLE To Sell Hereos And I Bet Others Agree. 2)I Also Hope You Guys MAKE IT EASIER For Us To Get BP\'S I Really Really Hope You Guys Get To Fulfill My Request! Its a good game!',
       'I gave the game another chance after my last review because the game is fun but it is my last time.. I am uninstalling and never again playing mlbb. I got afkers on my team in 4 consecutive classic games, and I still get feeders even though my rank is quite high.. why do I get paired up with feeders, I have no clue.  Goodbye mlbb, was great when I acually got a decent team and is actually capable of winning instead of having no chance at all and get trashtalked by opponents thinking they are all that.',
       'Not enough with unskippable tutorials now you want us to level up till lvl 8 to be able to change account? Here\'s some suggestion, make a button just before the tutorial, for login purposes for those who have old accounts. I mean, people sometimes reset their phone and you want us to play till level 8 again just so we can play old account? Be realistic developers.',
       'I like the game. My low rating is because I had to reset my phone and now have to go 8 lvl again just to reload into my account. It\'s bad enough you are forced to play the practice modes over again but lvl 8 is almost to ranked again. Why put that time in again. Lvl 5 maybe/understandable. But you\'ve made me not want to play this game anymore and it\'s sad because I enjoyed it',
       'Quite simply a super fun game. This game does exactly what it is supposed to, which is provide a fun portable moba experience condensed into short bursts of fun. This is one of the few games where even losing is a fun experience for me. Pros - wide range of heroes, fun over the top cartoon graphics, multiple game modes, great community and incredible speed of matchmaking that still some how retains quality of matchups. Cons - I am personally not a fan of the joystick based control system, the heroes require quite a bit of time playing before you can get enough in game currency to unlock them. So if you haven\'t already started playing this game then you are definitely missing out' ],

Also golden Crystal should drop more than 2400 minimum. Tier 4 class catalysts need to be easier to obtain  Awakening gems could be easier to get aswell. Also odin, beta rey bill, fantastic 4, more xmen',

       'I love the game and the vast amount of playable characters, however the sound effects overall aren\'t great but the gameplay is very good. One problem I do have however is that there are in models (such as thanos and Kang) but you can\'t play as them. Personally thanos is easily my favorite marvel character and the fact that I can\'t use him is a little upsetting. But overall its a great game with monthly updates and great new characters! Can\'t wait for more!',

       'Aftwr the last update I can\'t open the application. It goes to a black screen and thats here it stays.  If this should go on and I lose my rewards because of this I will no longer invest or ppay this game, because wht is the se to play a game 6 months or more just to just lose the one thing you really wanted to get.',

     [ 'I rather enjoy the game a lot. It feels balanced for the most part,  leveling takes a while which wouldn\'t be a issue if it didn\'t take so long to go place to place. Gets sort of annoying to go back and forth trying to get resources and the game goes from fun to grindy quickly.   My main issue is the battery life of my phone. While charging my phone and playing this game but battery was being drained.  Graphics are good, I enjoy the crafting and base building, the combat is nice, and the auto harvest feature is a life saver.',
       '**UPDATE** Is an awesome game. Could use a few more perks (ie. Weapons and hard to get items) in drop boxes and yellow zones.Now the down side is if you die in a level your last position is no longer there to try and recoup some of your items. Players killing you as you open trunks in inventory. Oh ya and the free spin box...give random prizes instead of coins and rope. People will get really into it if perks are awesome. Great game could be the best with a couple tweaks. Awesome job.',
       'Alright, so I don\'t normally write reviews, but I feel like this one is deserved. The games concept is great, as with most post-apocalyptic zombie games, surviving and building a base is the main goal. Great. However, it is a micro-transaction based game, meaning you have to pay for packages if you actually want to enjoy it to the fullest. Am I saying you can t enjoy it otherwise? No, I do and I don\'t pay for the packages, however, my house constantly gets destroyed, I\'m killed by other players who do pay, and my game progression is massively slow. So, I don\'t really recommend this game, if you actually want to "play" the game.',
       'Just another game that either makes you wait to play it, or pay not to wait. Why? Don\'t make me pay not to wait. Entice me to pay with cool things, otherwise it\'s an instant uninstall. Poor business model. Imagine paying double to get them to make your food faster at a restaurant, or just wait a long time. Would you really keep going there, or somewhere else that makes something just as good but in a reasonable amount of time?',
       'Anyway i edit this review... The is nice and graphics are cool. But there is the problem on the game. Could you pls remove the energy bar so i can still play the without waiting to fill the energy bar... Cause otherwise i less play this game in days... that you know you must wait your energy bar to fill again in a couple of minutes if the energy is gone?. Pls Remove it so we can play all day along.. Thank you.',
       'This game truly amazing with beautiful graphics, decent yet easy controls, a large amunt of items and okay customization. The only reason i give this a 4 star rating is because one thing. The hoard mechanic. I mean it\'s a good concept. The only problem is that there\'s a hoard every 24 hours. And since wood is kinda pain to get it sucks to come back after work to come to a destroyed house. If it was like every month or heck even every week that would be fine just please give more time than 24 hours for a hoard' ],

Once i played against 98 ovr player. He had 2 great and 6 good chances, i had 6 good chances and 0 great. It isnt ok.',
       'At first when I down loaded it I thought it would be a cheap version of real FIFA that you often have to pay for. I expected bad graphics, crashes and lots of bugs. I WAS WRONG!!! This game is literally the best ever. 01.03.18 Although in the new update I went to type something on leagues and the game just crashed, it also made my phone spam so I had to shut it down and reload my phone up, please investigate this.',
       'Hey fifa, it been like this even before the Toty event Almost 2 months, no adds, no stamina for me, this really unfair, all of my friends are getting adds stamina, TOTY, Carniball, and now Lunar year Those eventy went extremely terrible and useless to me with no stamina!!  Please help me and fix this, my app is up to date, and i even re unstall it a few times desperately trying ro get adds back! But it was no good 😔😔',
       'You\'re fucking shit EA. Your A.I. is overpowered like shit. Our "chances" in vs attack are full of bullshit. Money never lasts long when you\'re playing this shit. Your rewards are pretty crappy too. The "chances" when we\'re opening packs are not chances, it\'s "open as many as you want until you have no money left and still haven\'t gotten anything". If you\'re reading this (which you probably won\'t give a fuck about because you get this everyday), you better make some changes. If you\'re just hell-bent on making money, then you should go fuck yourself.',
       'So many bugs and the match making system is so stupid, I got matched with the same guy twice in a row and then got matched with someone 9 ratings higher than me. Another weird thing is that this game disconnects soooo easily... I was playing it then I got disconnected and couldn\'t join back in. I then tried playing my other games and my Wifi was just fine. EA why did you update this game the fucking shooting is so messed up... You\'ve fucked it up so bad',
       'How many packs to you need to open to get ONE envelope!!! I need one to get a lunar player. I opened nearly 70 packs, yes 70!!! And got absolutely nothing. Waste of your time. Spend your stamina where it\'s worthwile because Lunar New year is rigged' ],

     [ 'This game was great until about 5 days ago, that is when it started to take 4 to 5 minutes loading time for each game mode to start. Now my attention span prevents me from waiting that long to play one game. What happened game developers?.... !!UPDATE!! Okay it must have just been the servers. Because they\'re back up and running at 32 seconds loading time for a war. This game is great. I can dig it can you dig it',
       'They have fine a great job with this game. The dynamics, the playability, the graphics, and it feels as if you could never stop growing. Every bot is beast with a certain load out and play style.  Update! After playing for over 3 years, and over many different platforms this game rocks. It\'s definitely not the mech its the pilot kinda game. The balance is good so if you spend money and level quickly you\'ll be placed on your mechs rating(mech level + weapon level) so take your time and learn some tactics. Every gun has its purpose but it takes a good pilot to make them work.',
       'Game is designed to milk money out of its players. Fun to play. But $200 for a pretend robot or $100 for a single gun. Lower prices. You might be shocked more people can afford 20 than 200......reply- you think giving someone 15 pieces of a random bot that takes 2 games to earn if you place first out of the 10000 you need. Only real option they give is purchas. Don\'t be fooled. This is a pay to win game.',
       'A great game that brings back the old Mech warrior days. One of the few good theme fps shooters on this platform that is "FREE". You can pay to win but it will cost you alot. Investing afew tens to smoother the growth? But you can still have plenty of fun without spending a dime.  Until it slowly draws you in deeper.....',
       'I like how the game has gotten better over past year in many ways.. But could you guys quit making the puzzle peice stuff to get newest goodies? I get you added lots of cool ways to get extras that\'s cool and all.. But who wants 7 puzzle pieces out of 7,000? Not worth the effort. Keep it gold and silver guys!!',
       'Game plays fine. No ability to choose mode is a major letdown. I did the $20 test to see if you can actually buy anything valuable. The answer is no. The game is geared towards the have money people. Update 2/23/2018  The queing is under 10 seconds. After Lunar New Year update you can earn upgrades better.  Discounts on purchase items is better.' ],

     [ 'It started great and I was so looking forward to exploring all the rooms in the mansion. Unfortunately, after a short period of good progress it started putting in lots of delaying features: Read a letter, meet the neighbors, give the neighbors tea, read a book, look for another book. At this rate I\'ll never get to see another room. So now that I reached the level where I would have to pay them if I want to win any more games, I\'m just going to uninstall.',
       'I have not been able to play for 3 days now. Everytime I log on I can not click the play button even after I go into the app and force stop. It is hard to level up and the power ups don\'t always work. I have also lost items after winning them. I do not recommend this game sadly because I did find it fun at first.',
       'I really like this game.  I would give it five stars if you change a couple of things.  We should be able to create our own character,  there should be a player code that we could type in to go to a friends mansion.  But other than those things this is a great game that is a lot of fun for all ages!',
       'Haven\'t been able to log in to play for two days now. It\'s like the game is stuck. I\'ve tried to force stop, restart my phone. Nothing works. I\'d hate to uninstall because I\'ve put a lot into this game. Please help!!',
       'I really like the game but some of the tasks are so annoying (take a nap, read letter, open book and stuff like this). Still playing it and still enjoying it. Will suggest more options for the furniture and definitely options if we don\'t want to put some of the things, to can take it away. Because the game is obligating us to put things yes or yes even if you don\'t want it. So for me would be nice to have the option for "new" one or "take it away".',
       'Finally found a game I enjoy  so I thought.  I like each level is competitive until you get to levels that are impossible.  Like an idiot spent real money for extras guess what still stuck at same level, has been over a week same level.  Just another game will be deleted.' ],

     [ 'Seriously i have been playing this game since 2014. This time round after the lastest update the game its becoming more stupid. Its so so so difficult to change players during games. Changing players it take time  and very sensitive. I perfer the previous update on changing players. Just imagine to change a player during game time 67 min it take me till the game end and i cant get to change. I keep putting the player on but it keep not happening. Please fix it! I keep losing points just because of the update.',
       'I have been playing this game for over two years but I am losing interest. Too many changes to encourage you to spend money. I am currently sitting near bottom my league getting beat by teams that are significantly lower rated. Game mechanics are all wrong and the transfer system should revert back to the old way',
       'Biggest problem are managers who purposely tank every season get rewarded by keeping a stronger team while managers who try to play as the game was intended get "punished" every new season. No need to spend any money on this game, just tank on purpose. The only "fair" competition is the league. Cup, champions and association tournaments are a joke infested with tankers. Worse part of all is Nordeus does nothing about it. Players lose morale regardless if they win a match, they even lose morale overnight. I played this game for over 2 years hoping it would get better. It is time to let go.',
       'Its not the best football manager game an enthusiast would like to try. The game is designed to make a win or loss based on ensuring in-game puchases ..called \'lucky\' apparently . Plus you really dont have good gaming controls while you are inside a live match. Needs improvement to make it more real and fun to be indulged in.',
       'I don\'t understand players morale policy in this game!?! When I beat opponent with 4:0, some of players drops one morale point, even if they had excellent stats. Shouldn\'t morale rise after good game. Most annoying is losing morale overnight. WHY????',
       'What bullcrap is this. You make a downgrade. Substitution doesn\'t happen for an entire half. I play with 10 men. Screw you, you stupid idiots. Spoiling the game. And what garbage graphics are those. Money hungry people run everything for tokens. Be it the challenges or anything else, they are just greedy people. Shame on you. You spoil the game in every update. Will uninstall this garbage game.' ],

And I was about to uninstall it..     2_one of the question was you can play with other users offline. This is not correct!...     3_ need to add "Edit and changing names"     4_Game rated with 5 star.. Than you all 🎱',
       '"Cusion shot on 8 ball" games are great, woukd be cool if one was created at a lower buy-in though.  I think its currently like 8 million needed to play a bank the 8ball game.  I personally like the No Guidline 9ball games,but would love a cheaper bank the 8 game.    Also, well done on adding the upgrade-able cue sticks.  That alone, i think, has made this game much much better.',
       'I realize y\'all gotta get paid but why make the playing experience for those of us that don\'t pay cash money.  Not allowing a player to select a pocket when shooting the 8 ball and allowing your opponent to shoot and win. I guess I\'m pretty good because nobody has been able to get rid of me playing pool. Instead I seem to get strange lock ups or no response from game. I always seem to lose 100s of thousands. It\'s a pretty good app and I\'ve sent many people to download your app.',
       'Best pool graphic wise but the game is not fair what so ever. Game is Controlled you don\'t decide if you win the game does. Your win percentage and rank don\'t mean squat. Cues length and force controlled to games advantage even when reloaded. I had 6,991,000 and my win percentage was 61.3 and lost 1 million 5x in a row. How do I have a 61.3% chance of winning and lose so easily by these 40-50% players like nothing. If you don\'t actually buy stuff with actual money on app game will treat you poorly.',
       '8 ball i have been playing it for sometime now and I spend alot of money on the specials.. great specials.. but I noticed whenever I buy coins I don\'t win any games until those coins are over and I\'m only winning recently 2 games maximum in a row and normally my win streak used to be 7 and above... I don\'t know why this is happening but it sucks because it\'s putting me off the game.. it\'s like 8 ball is making sure I\'m losing hence the rate 3' ],

After spending +400 RL dollars to get one character it did not even drop the character and show how cheap and money hungry this company is.

     [ 'Best Drag racing game in Google play store. If you have a addictive personality don\'t play it. I do suffer from that first race was on Dec 312017 as of Feb 22, 2018 I have 208 hrs on the track 23 in the garage own 22 cars and spent over a Benjamin on it in less than a month. Ya gotta have some smarts to play and win. Money helps with extras. Only time I\'ve had a issue with it was this morning a season ended I was upgrading a Tier 5 car and paid with game money and didn\'t receive part. Still a 10 star game... Great job Developers!!',
       'Really really addicted. Yes you know when your good. Yes you do.  Ok honest? Expand on the shop.  Tweaking the appearance and performance of the rides.  Everyone has their own way of saying, yes that\'s how I would if I really could.  You end up creating a bond or developing a relationship  with it.  Take it to the next level!  Gear ratios and n02 pushezes and grip are all good but let\'s envelop.  I know I would play more if I could truly express my kickass whip that represents  me that I have to drive!  You have a clean and immersive game. Less is more.  Thank you',
       'Game is really great! Amazing graphics, amazing cars, lots of continuous fun! A few bugs and connection issues which can be frustrating at times especially when your team depends on you for points. Though I believe they\'ll eventually fix these issues as this is the BEST racing game out there and it\'s only getting BETTER!',
       'Love the new updates where you can carry on the trials without having to go back to the garage. It would be nice to able to trade up your keys i.e 500 bronze for 10 silver or 100 silver for 1 gold. And the stage 6 upgrades be not double up or get stage 6 upgrades relevant to the cars you have.',
       'Best onlin3 mobile racing EVER!! IM A VETERAN GAMER AND THIS GAME IS HANDS DOWN TOP OF THE MOBILE RACING GAME. Great detail and graphics. Precision tuning. REALISTIC CARS IN ALL ASPECTS. PLUS an added Bonus is it features FAST AND FURIOUS AND CARS FROM THE SERIES. I need access to more cars. Its so hard to get more silver or gold to get newer cars updated.',
       'Customer support has won me over. They have literally provided the best resolution can think of for the game removing all my fusion parts. Hopefully I don\'t have many issues in the future but this one time moment has definitely filled me with confidence that in future, zynga will fairly sort things out.' ],

     [ 'This continues to improve.The original variety was fun, but each new game just seems to get better.  The graphics were always good, but the new ones are truly impressive, and fun.  The way they are combining multiple features of earlier games offers more play options and payoffs.  Almost impossible to put down. Bad luck suddenly reverses and is FUN!  Mini games add surprising excitement.',
       'I like the games but.. I would rather go to a real casino if i wanna spend and win REAL money, so buying coins with REAL money just for innocent playtime is a Big turn off for me. You lose coins fast like the real slots, unfortunately. I just start playing the game for the first time and I\'m already out of coins. I believe they start you off with a low amount because I\'m already out of coins in 30mins of play. The games and the graphics are fun though, which makes it attractive to play. My only complaint is paying for those coins..',
       'It is obvious this game is set to minimal wins. And if by chance there is a big win there wont be another win and you will lose ALL your winnings. It is also obvious the bonus wheel is set for minimum payout and if you do hit the big one the wheel will either suddenly stop b4 or regain momentum to move to the next amount. Such a cheat!!!!! Money hungry cheating tightwads',
       'At one time this is my ultimate favorite app.   Today I just took my five stars away and gave you two. You\'ve turned out to be a very very expensive game. The only way a person is able to win is if they purchased of coins from you it\'s not very cool or very fun.   And with a heavy heart I had make it two stars. Such a bummer cuz I really enjoyed this app at one time.',
       'I have played this game for a very, very long time.  I even have my husband playing.  We have fun competing against each other!  My coins go up and down.   Lately it has been down.  I have purchased additional coins on several different occasions.   I wish I could say it benefitted me.   Unfortunately they went quickly.  Without any wins to show for it.    As I said, I truly enjoy the games and will continue to play.  It depends on the app,  as to how long I will play at  time.   Keep up the great work!',
       'I\'ve been playing House of Fun every day for more than 6 months now and I haven\' t been bored once. The graphics are amazing and being able to stop the reels when you want to is a big plus over other apps of this type. New games are introduced regularly so there is never a worry that you\'ll grow bored with the same old lineup.' ],

I would like to see mpre options for alliances in the future. Perhaps a deceptions option list where you can try to steal from other players without fighting. Stuff like that.   Otherwise enjoyable.',
       'This game favors the higher level players or those willing to pay. You\'ll get top level 5 or 6 and get attacked by someone at least twice your level and lose all your resources. It\'ll take days for your forces to be healed cause it takes resources to heal them, which were stolen. Anyone you attack won\'t have much resources for you to steal cause they\'ve either given up on the frame or too low of a level to have anything, so it\'s a huge waste of time. You can get a shield, but you have to buy what you can\'t get for free. It\'s a shame cause it\'s an okay game.',
       'Game crashed and I lost all progress including $$$ spent. Developers will not reply to my repeated requests to resolve the issue. Many other players have had the exact same problem. I would recommend people stay away from this game',

     [ 'Hate the new update. What\'s with you and all these chibi things? You\'ve done it before and based on the review, your players love the Mature and Realistic style much better. So why you changed back again? You have totally Lost your Identity and Uniqueness as LoA game.  If you planned on doing this, why don\'t you do it in the first place? so we don\'t have to waste our time and money!',
       'What\'s with the chibi hero icons? 😭 The artwork was so good and everything works smoothly before the update. Also, during battle, it\'s lagging. In my  opinion, the previous one is way better than current. I\'ve been a fan of different LoA versions, please don\'t ruin this one. 😟',
       'I *HATE* the new style. The reason why I liked this game in the first place was because there were no chibi characters. Dominion has no instructions and seems rather useless - but could be developed into something cool. The team formation doesn\'t have a way to sort your characters (I wish it was ordered by BR). I can get used to the new layout but for right now adjusting is hard. Thanks for developing the game more but please go back to the original character designs.',
       'I started playing this game few days ago and I liked it so much. The graphics, controls, story all we\'re very interesting and addictive. Until the developers decided to update this game and completely ruin it and making it just like other mainstream RPG genere with ordinary graphics.   They just completely removed the story of the game and now every stage looks like I\'m playing some Angry Bird infact even that game has some story to every level.   In conclusion, this game was more fun before the update but now it\'s like ordinary RPG.',
       'Update on 2/23 made the game worse. Originally i gave this game a 5 star but with this update it feels more like a 3 star if not 2 star game. I get that you have to update games to keep it fun but sometimes you shouldn\'t change something just for the sake of change. Why not add content instead of trying to fix something that isn\'t broken.',
       'Over all a good game! Heroes are very expensive to work on and it\'s very hard to work on any other hero apart from main 6 without spending real money. Plus there is to many players using hacks that take the fun out of it especially in arenas and dominion game features. Graphics were way better before last big update and easy to use screens but now it\'s childish looking to ons and not screens not as intuitive as before but  If your willing to spend money it\'s definitely worth a try!' ],

       'The game has a lot of bugs, some make combat unreliable. Every update slows player progression by removing or reducing resources you can earn, pushing players to spend more time & resources to obtain decreasing rewards.',
       'The game is on general okay, however I think it\'s made just for fancy phones. On mine it crashes by any fights. On other actions in game it functions ok.  Btw it\'s the only game that crashes on my phone all the time. I\'ve formatted my phone, deleted all photos to make more storage and memory spaces. Nothing helps. I think you might enjoy this game more if you have a powerful phone',
       'The only thing that\'s not great is the load in process. I can have perfect Wi-Fi connection and it\'ll lag horribly and kick me from the game costing me keys energy and arena tokens like I went inn and just left.',
       'All the worst mobile mechanics packaged together in a half baked fantasy world: RNG "summoning" heroes, stamina used to limit play, auto-play battles.  It\'s yet another mobile game made by casino lobbyists and not game developers.',
       'Fun little game with plenty to keep you busy. The characters are a little repetitive in terms of race and class, but understandable considering the dynamics of the game. There are a few mechanics I\'d like to see added (such as a collect all function on incoming mail, an easier to find help/tutorial on the UI) and of course lowering the ridiculous prices in their store, but there\'s plenty of freebies to make the game enjoyable for everyone and not just for the rich few.' ],

You can only get so far, then you a required to spend actual cash to continue playing. If you want to max out your base you better have DEEP pockets. This is not a joke, if you want to be a serious player, it will cost you around $300 a week just to keep up. Only the rich get anywhere in this game.',
       'Mobile Strike has reset game.   Nothing below cyber troops are being supported , no RSS .   Also.  One cyber Titan can zero anything that has highest normal T52 troops and best bio titans...... without sending a commander Once u reach building level 1100 offered for less than 19.99 USDyou will have no access to packs less than $100 USD and no access to RSS for older troops',
       'I use to have one of the strongest bases in MKST.. Mistress Vixen..nickname Vix.  Anyhow i have spent easily around $3,000 us dollar on this game. And one day my shield lapsed and I got zeroed after about 40 plus hits. I quit playing. I started back and spent  littke money cause I missed my alliance people I started to consider family after almost a year of play.  Anyhow now they came out with cybernetics and the packs for that are $99.00 everytime. I\'m sorry this has went to far. This is a pay to play game 100%.',
       'Lots to do to increase your power, tons of new buildings giving massive power boosts, just wait a little bit & you may get lucky with a $99 pack being reduced to $19. Make sure you have plenty of money for this game. If you don\'t have the money, then starting out new, you\'ll be at a stand still around HQ level 20 & commander level 50, with only increasing power by researching, training more troops, & building traps for your wall. This game has been slowing down a lot lately though, not sure if it\'s the game or my phone causing it.',
       'Some comments are exxagerated ... yes to be a top player you need to spend some money. But you can be plenty strong to play against the top players and only spend 20$ or so a week. Inventors have a gold mine for sure, but I enjoy the game very much so.   --&gt;InSightFull',
       'It is a good game but if you don\'t like going around hitting empty bases. Or waiting on shields to drop and hit somebody it is pretty boring . alliance chat can help pass the time. Always somebody bigger and hour after shield drops I get wrecked at level 310 so if you not willing to put some money into the game to try to keep up then it will be a waste of time.' ],

Direct private message with a city from within Game.   4. Make a city tagged as favourite city or liked city.   5. Want a clean viewing mode of own city without those construction hats and other info symbols on top of  building being constructed.  I think they are massively missed. And if you can provide these facilities then it will be the best game of it\'s class.',
       'The movement and the ability to delete structures for refund could be better. Trading HQ could be so much better, my main concern are the loading screens. Perhaps instead of loading the whole city a separate map viewer could be opened that shows general statistics and layout but not the entire city. That way trading could be done faster between cities and there would be more involvement with the trading community. As it stands its a real chore and is deterring me from trading as much as I\'d like. Another idea is if the stock market could be integrated somehow. I think that would be cool, and it would add an element of realism.',
       'Thanks for new upgrade . Even when the game was slow i didn\'t stop playing. I love this game. It\'s not only a game for me...i am a President of my club and i have to lead my members... in less than one year i reached level 50 and almost all land expanded...just  you have to understand how to play... be smart... some advice for beginners  start participate in mayor competition...this way you will grow faster',
       'Addictive & fun.  In a perfect world: more land expansion is needed. Also, variable prices at the GTHC based on scarcity would be better than fixed ones based on difficulty to produce.  One important thing.  There is premium currency in this game.  It\'s very easy to accidentally spent it, as there is no confirm button on premium currency purchases.  Fix this and will give 5-stars again',
       'I would of rated this 5 stars if I didnt loose all mt progress I tried logging in to google play but it said sorry mayor this city is linked to another device. This is the same phone I\'ve had it on so im really really ANGRY about it so yeah. Help me get my old city back ELECTRONIC ARTS . My city had over 100,000 population I had the airport Dr vu\'s tower and the port and everything else apart from the building so yea. Im so bummed. HELP ME PLZ',
       'i like the quests to earn gold keys & platinum keys. other players can see what is in my storage & i hope EA can block/fix that. there are still video ad problems; a video will either play or not; and it will not return me to game; and/or it will not offer the three choices. 02/20/2018. how many times do i have to rate game?' ],

     [ 'I love this game. Just like other reviews say, it is addicting and because there are constant tasks to complete. Plus!..unlike other games, there is no way you ruin out of coins/money. The cities bring in alot. I can\'t agree with one reviewer that megabucks are hard not come by.  I began with 25 I believe (now at 32) and some of the tasks to complete give megabucks without spending actual money to even purchase some.  All in all, try this game and you won\'t run bored of it.',
       'Great, but really needs "sell all" function for dealing with store house and "pecial buildings" components.This is a really quality game, looks amazing, works well and has good timed construction projects. However, as others mention it takes SOOOOOOO long to accrue the assets for construction and the mega bucks for expansion. You have to be VERY patient if you are not willing to part with actual cash. An idea might be to offer a conversion of coins to megabuck, maybe get 1 buck in excahge for eg 5,000,000 coins?',
       'Best game!! Very addictive, Been playing this game for over a year.. although, there are still alot to improve!  I hope the developers will include edit mode in the next update so that the players can rearrange their city..Also, I hope they will also include a 360 rotation of the city and add factories that can also create materials needed in the game like the railroad materials and steels. I am looking forward with this updates!!',
       'Been playing for more than 3 years, i lost count. But this is a wonderful game which encourages teamwork and neighbor support. There are barely any paywalls in this game and  if you have hundreds of facebook friends who have this game you can easily get the materials you need to expand your city. No limits so far. I give ★★★★★s',
       'lnstaII \'VEARN\' App Enterr (CRETA) to Start Earning So far so good.Fun way to get money. Won\'t make you rich but the extra cash is helpful. It\'s also the best exchange rate on points. McEarn points equals mc instead of like some of the others where it takes VEarn points to reach vc etc...Also, lnstaII \'TOYOCASH\' App Enterr (TRDG) very reliable in paying you when you redeem to toyocash. You can choose assorted giftcards as payment or transfer to Walet for cash. Your choice. I love these guys thanks for addingsome fun to my day.',
       'The new update is great! Really appreciate the chat system. But it could be better... maybe add some functionality to the capital buildings and states.... maybe bonuses to taxes nd pop, loans, and coop science and military missions.

There are many aggressive players that assault you early on in the game and unless you pay money it becomes difficult to maintain a stable civilization. I believe it would be better if there were cheaper or easier ways to gain resources for those whom don\'t pay to win. Thank you for the amazing game though! Love you guys and I will never quit playing!',
       'I like the game but there is some bullying that happens. No limit on how many times a player can attack you. I was attacked 60 times in an hour by the same player killing every troop I had, cleaning out all my resources and destroyed one of my bases. It is just plain malicious. I have brought it up before and no one cares to do anything to fix it.  Update: I sent the above message months ago and received no response. This is classic "pay-to-play" tactics that promote bullying to get you to pay for upgrades. I won\'t be playing anymore.',

You have to constantly keep your troops hidden and protected as there is always a higher level person out there that will injure/kill every single one of them.   Training 100k+ troops takes MONTHS and they will be killed instantly the moment you forget to protect your troops for an hour.  I don\'t know how this game is rated so high,  it must be from all the initial reviews submitted by early new players.' ],

     [ 'It feels like it was a soccer game that they changed a few thing to make it a hockey game.  That said it\'s not too bad.  I don\'t understand the finance part and there is no where to explain it.  The transfer portion is odd too.  The player got way more expensive with the last update.  It is irritating that I can\'t afford to sign my prospects once they are fully realized.  If I develop a 71 rated prospect it will cost me $700000 to sign him.  That is approximately 300 coins.  I could just let him walk and use those coins to sign 2 73 rated players... It makes no sense.  I have to forgo upgrades to afford to sign prospects.',
       'I like the game. You can do good if you put some thought into it. My only  complaint, is that I didn\'t make it to the next level at season end which is fine but why did I get reset at the minimum for that level and I check the standings and there are teams that already have enough points to make the next level?  I\'m 15-0 in my season and still 100 pts behind the leading team and not even in the top 1000.',
       'I\'m really confused as to why I can only win games if I\'m 10+ overall better than my opponent. If we are even close to the same rating I get my butt kicked. It\'s absolutely ridiculous and seriously makes the game not fun.',
       'Abritrary garbage.  Great concept, poor execution.  Built a solid team and still lose even when ratings are better then opponents consistently.  Out shoot the opponent 97-8 and still lose.  Recommended if you need an exercise in futility in your life.',
       'Not a bad game, but I\'ve noticed lately that the "reimbursed" money from voided contracts doesn\'t get added to my in-game wallet. Which is annoying since I need it to sign players.',
       'Game updates hurt you. Increased value of players to sign yet, left my teams wallet short. No fun when, updates cost me more money.' ],

     [ 'Good game if u liked the bleach anime. I don\'t recommend buying orbs price is ridiculous.  And packs misleading. Says $80 for 585 orbs .( 490+ 95 bonus orbs) . That\'s means only 585 orbs. If u thought that was gonna b over 1k orbs. Ur wrong. They got me lol. And no compensation :(',
       'I can\'t even play the game I spent 3 hours making space for it and it won\'t even correctly finish downloading all the additional data. It want from getting to at least 46% done down to .4% before telling me there was a error.',
       'Great game for bleach lovers... But come on... Just spent around 5000 orbs trying to get a grimmjow and nothing... Just a bunch of repeated useless things... And every time there\'s a new upload I just spend hours trying to get it... Kinda losing patience here',
       'Drop rates for 5* could be better. I\'m not saying give them away, but 3% ? For veteran players who have to buy orbs, that makes for a lot of discouraging multis. Gameplay is awesome , and the guild addition has brought life back to the game',
       'Love the anime? Now love the game! Only issue is it\'s a bit hard on older phones as I get killed in raids being unable to control my character due to frame lag and complete freezes, which dont allow me to dodge or use strong attacks to avoid damage. Plz allow.for this in future updates. Moto G3 running latest android',
       'I had to lower my rating for this game.  At a certain point, it\'s extremely exhausting grinding for Spirit Orbs(the in-game currency for those who don\'t play).  I hate to put them on blast, but there is a handful of characters that are very overpowered that are nearly impossible to obtain.  KLab is just another selfish, cash-grabbing company.  I used to love this game.  I completed the daily missions everyday, but now there\'s no point.  There\'s no point to this game.  No matter how much skill you possess, you will not defeat certain characters unless you have them because Brave Battles are out of your control.  I\'ve been loyal to this game.  I\'ve endorsed it to my friends.  I\'ve invested time and money.  All of it was for nothing.  It\'s not fun anymore.  KLab is trash.  EDIT:  I\'ve officially stopped playing this game.  It\'s ridiculous.' ],

     [ 'I think this game is brilliant. An absolute pleasure to play and I never get bored. This game should be voted one of the best games ever. Obviously I like other games but this is a whole different story. I just wanted to say please make it so u can join lower levels friends? I can\'t join my sister and were only five levels apart.',
       'Absolutely great game ,but you made some far too powerful guns too accessible early in the game, so I went down two trophies after I ran into a bunch of wallet warriors. And for God\'s sakes put a more powerful gun at the end of the campaign, I worked my ass off and it wasn\'t worth it. Other than that large rant, I love it so much and play it every day. Make exp,gold and diamond easier to obtain though.',
       'I LOVE this game My only complaint is in campaign mode it\'s said more worlds coming soon for YEARS!!! If they\'re not going to add a world eny time soon  they should at least change the coming soon part. But overall this is a good game and it seems like Cubic Games really care about what the consumers think.',
       'This game is so good! I have played this game when it was in its early stages, and it was pretty good. Now it has gotten even better than before, with lots of multiplayer game options and lots of weapons and gadgets to choose from. There is one problem, which is when I got this game about a month or two ago, the prices to upgrade guns were pretty low for coins but ok for gems, but now they are ok for coins and WAY TO MUCH for gems, so I ask of you developers to please decrease the amount of gems it takes to upgrade gem bought guns.',
       'I don\'t like this update. Why does it cost so much to upgrade  weapons 2 more damage higher. And I don\'t like the fact that all the weapons that have low stars are nerfed. When I was on level 6 the hellraiser was a beast. Then when I got to level 7 I it wasn\'t as good, so I tried to upgrade it. BUT the price cost 120 coins. I am really disappointed about this. I played this game for 2 years and it sad to see how hard it is to win. They only want money that\'s it. Make your game better and fair. It\'s so unbalanced.',
       'It\'s a great game.... until you reach level 27, then there is a REDICULOUS difficulty curve. I was steadily climbing the tornament leaderboard, I was good, then I kept getting destroyed after hitting 27 with OP items and no gems to get the new weapons, because I had spent them leveling up my weapons and was out. What are you thinking? Lag, not double jumping, not firing when I need to, occasionally. How rediculous.' ],

     [ 'Players are bailing from this game like crazy. My clan has lost nearly all the higher level players, most from leaving the game. So the clan is all low level players who can\'t contribute as much. Arena player\'s list shows everyone but the top 3 not playing all week. A ton of other issues that you can find in any ABE forum and even in the comments on posts on the ABE Facebook page. I think Rovio\'s stock trend shows it all.',
       'This use to be my favorite game. Have spent alot of money playing. Due to the "white out" have not been able to play for 3 months. Even after several updates, nothing. Tech support claims to be on the issue... Very frustrating!!!!',
       'A very simple yet satisfying game. I also like the "time decay," the ability for advanced users to skip over routine aspects of the game. This way the game hasn\'t become tedious although I\'ve been playing it for quite awhile.',
       'OK. So, it started off fun. But, now all I get is lost connection, slow connection or some other BS! I\'m not going to be able to get any further because I won\'t pay for stuff. So, it\'s going to be uninstalled. Of you must, play for a week, then ditch it',
       'More or less meh, can do with or without. Asks frequently if you enjoy the app, if you say "no" then that\'s it. However, only if you say "yes" will it ask you to rate it. Pathetic that the developers don\'t actually want feedback. Needs some smoothing out on a few things, but Rovio doesn\'t care.',

     [ 'I\'ve been playing this game since shortly after launch, and I love the gameplay and nostalgia it has to offer. However, the company has lately been predatory with low value bundles, which at first glance, might look like a good deal to a newer player. I would warn new players not to buy anything in-game until they get their act together.  Also, the game has been more buggy than usual lately, but I\'ll let that slide and hope it gets better.  In short, this is a 5 star game run by a 1 star company.',
       'This recent GUMI bundle offer really put a bad taste on the game for me. It really was not a favorable cash bundle for loyal customers in my opinion. I wish the banner was only 20 dollars or less or provided the loyal customer the choice of which 5* character they wanted guaranteed.  GUMI, please change this business practice and take care of the great community instead of continuing down this path of bringing the game down in customer loyalty and fun!!. The quality of the events, rewards, etc have dropped.',
       'After all the previous issues of bugs, hacking, etc, the game has really picked up its slack. The game is so muchs smoother now and seems like more effort has gone in to it. Drop rates still seem low, since the 3x boost I still receive basics, but that\'s not a huge issue as theres always a free giveaway every week. Overall the game is finally enjoyable without constant issues',
       'This is actually one of my favorite Final Fantasy titles. Graphics are gorgeous. The story is pretty deep and well written. The number of playable characters is astounding and most don\'t recycle moves. The devs update it regularly and are active in communicating with the community. A few things are kinda "broken", like the arena. And Microtransactions aren\'t overpowering, but they\'re there... 4/5',
       'I like the game but the summon rates are just messed up. My friends sat down with me and watched, on multiple occasions, where I would do like ten or 11 summons all at once and Id get 10 or 11 of the same unit. Ive summoned enough gokens to get 2 of his tmrs, same with yuri and conrad. While these tmrs are good, I would like to have more than a pool of ten units to summon from, Im just sayin 🙄',
       'Dropping my rating from 5 to 1. While the game content itself is pretty fun, over the past several months the developers have really started releasing more and more offensively priced bundles. As a player I\'m fine spending some money in a game, and have spent plenty in this over the time I\'ve played, but with the latest 10+1 cash bundle, I feel like they\'ve gone a bit too far.' ],

     [ 'I used to love this game, very addictive but recent updates have made the game have too many elements (clubs - who cares???) Ads all over and money disappears quickly due to cost of each game.  Not easy to complete games it feels "fixed" with random cards plus drains the battery on my phone.  Uninstalled.',
       'This is my 3rd review. Love the game but had issues when ads were introduced. That was rectified, then had issues with new Android version. That was fixed and game was going fantastically for about 3 weeks and now they have reduced the amount of free treasure to $1000 instead of $5000. This means I need to come back 3x more often without playing a single game just to be able to play once.',
       'I would like it more if in the perk levels it showed how many club points were needed for each level and how many more are needed to finish the perk level. The green filling up the bar doesn\'t really accurately show how close you are. It looks like you are almost done, but then it takes forever to fill up so you don\'t know how many more points you need.',
       'This game has many issues! It continually freezes and shuts me down. I can no longer play on my tablet, which I purchased just for games, and have to use my phone. I don\'t like using my phone because it drains my battery. I am so ready to quit this game and return to candy crush instead. Latest updates have rendered JP and other perks useless.',
       'Originally I really liked this game BUT the further you go the  more it costs to play.  That was ok, but you add more and more ads in there, they are on the "boards" they are between the games, between the levels and NOW you have Tri Peaks Solitaire brought to you by, yet another game. I like it, as a game it\'s addictive and was  fun but I think I have had enough.  It\'s becoming not so much fun and headed for the uninstall list.',
       'I don\'t know if a review is still available  after a game has been deleted. The game was fun to play I\'ll say that. I didn\'t need 5 push notifications coming @ me in the middle of the night however. The one that came through @ 3:17 a.m. was it for me, I\'m out.' ],

     [ 'I love this game. Every game I\'ve had, I played for a week or so, and uninstalled. But this one? Ive had for almost 6 months. Been playing every single day. Finally reached legendary 32, I\'ve unlocked everything. I love the VIP subscription and upgrades it gives you. I would like atleast one new vehicle option every month or so. Or at least a new adventure spot. Making a modded version of the rally car would be fantastic. Also, an upgrade on the formula car where it doesn\'t almost dead stop after it lands from a big air.',
       'I enjoy the game greatly. It\'s slightly different with  the chest and stuff but it is sure nice to get bonuses every now and than. There are new adds though which I\'m not super stoked about like the brake time adds but they keep them short and can be skipped quick if you have already watched them. All and all great game',
       'If you don\'t want to give away free stuff from the chests, don\'t. But stop wasting my damn giving me these "free" coins for watching a video only to have the ad freeze %95 of the time. The are plenty of other free games out there, might be time for a change.',
       'Well done with stealing the boxes idea from clash royale wow you didn\'t even Change the opening times, I think the next thing you should do is offering legendary and epic chests with legendary and epic cars. I have loved the first part of this game it was funny and doesn\'t make any pressure on you, the second one should be blocked from play store, shame on you..',
       'Superb game! Too bad, the elements of hate like to hack good things and cause frustrations. For this reason, constantly run constant updates. I wouldn\'t mind paying through my rather expensive data to diffuse the damage by these bored, small prick nincompoops! Africa😝😝😝',
       'Pretty good game the Ads are insane and they want a ton of money per month to get rid of them. Seems to be the way all the games are going. For the Chinese new year could have mad a tuk tuk I think it\'s called a mini taxi. Or something cool for China.' ],

     [ 'While there is some advantage to buying packs, it is not so huge you cannot defend. Packs are much cheaper than Game of War. This game is pretty well worth it.  The best advantage you can give yourself if you\'re going to spend money is definitely the diamond mine.  You can get free gems and everything from the game as well.  Make sure you\'re in an excellent alliance.  I play on server 70, my alliance is Strength and Honor  I can teach you to play for free.  Remember, if you\'re going to change your name, open your growth packs.  Then tap your monarch, tap details and the green switches allows you to change your picture (nothing worse than being a chick with a dude avatar) and the quill and parchment allows you to change your name.  If you\'d like to join me for more helpful info, come to server 70, you get two migration tokens for accounts less than 3 days old and below keep 6.  Have fun and enjoy the game.',
       'I\'ve been locked out if my account since February 15th I\'ve written customer service everyday.  Members of my alliance have written them trying to help me and received answer in one or two days.  I received one reply on Feb 23rd asking what happened.  They sent my friends what info they needed to supply in order to get their account back.  I used that information and sent them what they asked for.... To no avail. My account was hit, is now half power, I missed the previous event in which I planned to upgrade and buy generals and I buy the gems package every month so I\'ve missed 1500 gems per day. I want my account back....I want compensation.....I want a response',
       'Customer service is not responding, I have played for over a year, and they don\'t help with any problems.  I have had a ticket in for over 10 days with no response.  Many players are quitting and they don\'t care.  Once a business quits supporting customer service, the writing is on the wall.  I will not spend another dollar on a dieing company.',
       'What a fun game. I put up a 24 hour shield which disappeared after 7 hours. When I went to put up another one, my city buff said I had 17 hours remaining. So I was attacked, all troops killed, oh and then my city was force ported. An additional fun feature is help and support. When you contact them, they don\'t reply, but delete all trace of your complaint. Unfortunately for me, I had already paid for three packages. So if you\'re looking for glitches, being ripped off and being treated with contempt, this is the game for you.',
       'The app has glitches. This glitches will make you lose troops that you spent lots of hours or money to train, but when you report it get no response back. They only care about your money. The only good thing I got out of this game is the friends, but there\'s others way of communicating',
       'Awesome game, fun time killer and is extremely addictive. Only downside is those build times man, they take forever and I\'m only half way to the highest keep! Other than that, I haven\'t had a problem ever!' ],

The favorites is a good way to let folks focus on building certain characters.  The transition points are still frustrating, especially when you get a run of bad luck with tokens.  Tokens might work better if they scaled instead. Biggest issue is progression awards',
       'The game is really fun. You collect comic covers, which are heroes/powers, to battle in a match 3 style game. It\'s great for a Marvel fan like me. The only down side is the high price to expand your roster. You can earn hero points in game to expand the roster but the price climbs higher, making it impossible to collect new covers without spending real money. This issue is strange because it prevents you from collecting more, even though the idea is to collect more. The price to expand should be a lot lower',
       '[If this game doesn\'t grab your attention; I don\'t know what will when it comes to puzzle strategy games.  This game grabs the game players attention from the get-go. The controls are very smooth and have stream lined over the past few updates.  The graphics are prestine and put you right on the battlefield.  Far superior to this gamed Nintendo predecessor.  Keep up the good work!  Tah... Tah... for now!]',
       'It\'s a really fun strategic game with great art, lots of stuff to do and grear updates all the time.   Thank you for finally adding more mutants.  The last standing online Marvel game not affected by the ban of the X-men and the Fantastic Four',
       'Poop, poop, poop, poop. The game is a standard matching puzzle game, but when the opponent goes they get multiple chains of matches from the falling crystals. Then you make a match and no falling chains. It\'s pretty lame, plus you have to purchase new hero slots with coins that you rarely get without paying real money for them. There\'s so many other things won\'t that just make this game a total cash grab. It\'s not even that fun.',
       'Awesome !!  battle against the evil and. Build your team to be an unstoppable force. Keeping it fresh with heros from the movie, and with new heros added all the time, you need more chess type strategy as your hero collection grows,  pairing heroes against hero, or hero against monster, and vice a versa.added a new twist to keep it fresh. New cover, new revolution to keep up with the times, yet the core is still fight for the right. The refreshed animated covers are Amazing, my favorite so far Dr Banner. BTW watch out for traps!' ],

I don\'t really know where else to write this but I have been having a problem with the evil emperor of the universe event. At the end of the event it says it gave me medals and in inventory it says I have more than enough medals, but when I go to awaken a character it says I don\'t have any. Please help',
       'I\'ve been playing this game since it first came out I even have a jp account this game is by far the greatest of all time that I myself have ever played. With this game I get to use some of my favorite characters of all time and one of my most recent acquired cards Goku Black rose which is also my favorite villain of all time. This game gives great experience and fun to whomever is the player. Spectacular Game Bandai! I can\'t wait to summon on the new super vegito banner wish me luck:).',
       'Somethings that would be nice LR reverse medals that revert LR\'s to thier base form so you can unlock thier potential easier. More ways to unlock medals like maybe some kind special treasurer where you can juts buy any medals. More LR\'s. There are far to many borly\'s so plz stop adding more. These are just a few nitpics but I like the game',
       'The Game is amazing . No glitches. ,story line fits perfectly,  there is nothing wrong with the in game and the gameplay of it. The only trouble I am having recently all day is that the downloading on the recent update is not workibg. Im standing right next to my internet box and it says my internet is Excellent. But every time i try to download this game it is just saying. "Download Fail" Please fix',
       'I\'ve been playing on and off since the 2nd year anniversary. All around this game is awesome.  I would love more ways to grind for dragon stones tho. I\'m happy to pay for them when i can but working for them is always better.  I have a couple requests. Since you\'re bringing back old events. Can we have the one for Epic Battle! Arise, Otherworld Challengers medals. I would love to finally dokkan awaken super saiyan goku (angel) (super kaioken)  Also, is there a way we could get notifications when certain items like medals are on sale/ in Baba\'s shop?',
       'Dear bandai namco i hope you read my review. Recently a new data was available for loading although my network was stable and the app was updated instead of using 800 mb of data it still requires much more data.

     [ 'Very addictive and always checking on my base, upgrades etc. Strategic game play, however too much pressure to buy diamonds as it takes FOREVER! !! for some things to upgrade. Seriously. ..2 days for an upgrade??? Only other issue is the limited time "special abilities"...they\'re fun but it makes it far too easy for someone to raid your base and take all resources needed to get the upgrades. Lots of fun and love the graphics',
       'This is not another Clash of Clans clone, but definitely pushes the boundaries of the clan genre. Good graphics, fun gameplay, and balanced in terms of units vs. defences for your island. While diamonds can be purchased by real-world money, the game doesn\'t trap you into needing them. The weekly mini-game missions help keep things fresh and assist in moving your base up the tech tree if you\'re patient. SuperCell is continually expanding the game to keep it interesting. Definitely worth a download!',
       'I have played this game since it has come out and I have seen all of the changes and they have shaped that game for better over the years the game has been out it has improved and is one of my best games I have ever played. But the down side is that it is really hard to get resources at first but then before you know it you are full and you have nothing to do about it. Also when getting the heros they should make that base a bit easier because the lower level people can\'t attack till the have a lot better troops.',
       'I like the game, but i dont like waiting so much for upgrades or even re summoning troops. Diamonds are ok, but upgrades should go faster if u make an upgrade with Diamonds. That way donations become more useful.  There should be a better way to match against players and viceversa, Im tired of higher levels raiding my base without the proper protection.',
       'Great game, but too slow. While I love the lack of pay to win, I\'d wish for a way to speed up resource gathering: I\'ve cleared out every similar level player in my area, and spend days waiting for RSS to build up so I can upgrade. Which is necessary before I can access a larger zone. No point buying speedup gems, as I\'ve never anything to use them on!',
       'Fun game to a certain point, but it starts to get annoying when you are trying to save up resources and everyone that attacks you is 4-5 levels above you and destroy your base without a problem. Every person that I attack is a level or 2 above me. Need to work on leveling the playing field.' ],

     [ 'Well, I still liked Duel Generations better, and wish that that game would work again, but I have to admit that visually and game play wise Deul Links is pretty amazing. Especially for a free game. I haven\'t gotten very far into it yet, but so far it\'s intuitive and just really slick looking. However, there is one reason I still would prefer Generations, and that is because I loved the inclusion of ALL versions of Yu-Gi-Oh, not just the first series. I grew up with 5DS  and Zexal more than anything, and I wish that those series could be incorporated into the game somehow. I\'d love to be able to play as Kite or Astral or something.',
       'Found Yu-Gi-Oh on Netflix last week and decided to rewatch it. A few episodes in, and my love for the show rekindled, I got eager to play the game myself. I used to play with Yu-Go-Oh cards when I was a kid but it\'s been about 12 years since then and so all my old cards are in the loft, not that I know anyone IRL anymore who would fancy a game anyway, and not accessible right now... plus I had forgotten most of the rules too. But this app is just what I was looking for: a way to relearn the rules and have a bit of fun. Perfect for whatever skill level you\'re at with the game!',
       'this truly an amazing game, there\'s really only a couple of things, why reduce the monster and spell/trap zones to only 3 cards? I wouldn\'t say it\'s bad, I just don\'t see why you\'d need to do it.. plus the average deck size of yugioh is between 40 and 50 cards, why limit us to only a max of 30 cards? (not including the 5 for extra  decks) but all in all its a great game! Finally got my six samurai deck!😄 also, I think it\'d be an awesome idea to put in a way for duelists to redeem the codes on the cards they\'ve purchased IRL. I bet that\'d get even more duelists to play! Just a thought though😊',
       'My app is not opening. I love this game wish you have have out more different cards in the packs. I would like to see swords of reveling light. A bunch of rare magic and trap cards. You should not be able to use Odion\'s chain reaction duel sense in the PvP duels.',
       'Never played Yugioh this is the first time in this game and it is easily accessible with this game to get into this card game. I liked Yugioh better than the other TCG game like Pokémon,Hearthstone,Magic etc and I thought they are kind of more complicated for me because of their sourcing system like mana and energy while its all about monster cards, traps and spells etc. Very good card game and newbie friendly in general both those wanting to get into Yugioh and card gaming in general :D',
       'Trash, true fans would never say this game is great. Only 3 monster and spell/trap zones and the person that goes first only starts with 4 cards? Really? Not to mention the terrible camera angles and rigged matches. If you\'re a competitive player that doesn\'t like to get bs, don\'t play this.' ],

     [ 'So I am a major mobile gamer.  And I must say this game is awesome in a number of ways. My cons however is: arena battles are way too long.     : more clarification should be emphasize on "finish daily or unfurnished daily", I can\'t seem to understand when my daily is completed by looking at the daily chart.  : too much pay to play going on. Mix it up a little plz.   Pros. Great story line.            Epic fighting styles.             Awesome mounts.             Super clean graphics.              Will keep u entertained.',
       'Its a good game. One of the nicest mmorpg on the market right now. However, my only nitpick is the lack of customization of the characters. You get new armor but your actual appearance doesn\'t change except with outfits, but everyone has those so at the end of the day your character does not feel unique at all. The combat and navigation are on point though. Overall a good game but just lack of personal input.',
       'Man I gotta write this again &gt;~&lt;... The only thing u need to fix is the bug that doesn\'t allows you to see the characters... It really anoys me b/c I\'m a girl and only the boy characters are visible so please fix tgis in the next game update! That\'s the only bug that I have experienced! Anyways everyother thing is *AWESOME* btw my character is the puppeteer if that helps in something',
       'It sucks! Idk why it seems force close playing for 1-15sec and I got out if of game! FORCE CLOSE ALWAYS HAPPEN. First day I play the game I got no problem. But since 2nd day till now ALWAYS FORCE CLOSE! AND U GUYS SEEM DONT GIVE ANY RESPONSE TO THE REVIEWS. SUCKS!',
       'This is actually a very good mmorpg game, i\'d like to say it\'s the best mmorpg, but, the bug isn\'t fixed yet, i can\'t see my character when playin, also the puppeter and bountu hunter. Fix this bug quickly, i want to play this game so bad. I can\'t enjoy the gameplay if the characters are invisible.',
       'The last blessing event is a scam!! I spend a lot to get rank 1 and my point was 2x rank 2, but never get the reward til today!! The first message from the CS was to be patient and wait but the last message i got from the CS was maybe someone else got rank 1. Really? On a dead server?? Rank 1-4 was won by all by my guild moron!! My point was 2x rank 2!!! Someone else my ass!! Its a scam, ill report to google!!' ],

     [ 'This game is the only one of it\'s kind that I\'ve ever really gotten into. But I fell in love with it and have gotten some real cool friends out of it. They really have thought everything thru and keep improving the game play consistently. Other than not explaining a few parts of the game enough I really don\'t have any complaints.  You really don\'t have to spend money, as long as you are an active player an devote enough time to it. And from what I have heard about other games it\'s not quite as crazy of a $$$ spong as some other games my brother plays. Over all I think this if a great game and I would recommend it to anyone who is looking for that new game to occupy your boredom & spare time. I give it a 9 outta 10.',

     [ 'Love that you can now earn gems from reading.  However part of the fun of games like this is the outfits and personalization of your character. Outfits and style choices should be free to choose the best one that advances you in the story. It\'s not fun playing a game that forces you to fail/have a negative outcome. Big decisions/game altering choices should cost gems that makes it fun spending your savings but ultimately free outfit/style choices please',
       'Love this game! The only part I don\'t like is that all of the best options cost diamonds and you literally have to pay for them. It makes sense for an app, but it happens to often. It ruins the story because I won\'t buy any diamonds. I\'ll rate this 5 stars if they at least change it to not as often.',
       'I like the game but waiting three hours for two passes is terrible.  And we have no other option to get free passes it is either wait or pay. I feel like I\'d we got more than two passes I would be okay with the wait. But waiting three hours knowing I am going to use those two tickets in less than a half hour is crazy.  Then I will lose interest in the story and forget what had happen, it isn\'t okay. But other than the wait for passes I really like this game.',
       'I really like the idea of the whole game.  And the episodes are pretty good in length depending on what story you use. But I think it is completely ridiculous that you have to wait 4 hours for more passes.  Overall,  if you don\'t mind waiting and are a very patient person then I do recommend this app for you.  However if patience is a virtue you don\'t have then you should find a different app.',
       'Great app, just too many of the same type "romance" stories over and over again. It feels like only one person is writing stories on here, when It claims to have over 55,000 different stories. Each time i try to search for a new book to read a new, the same twelve pop up over and over. Fix that please. I very much enjoy supporting community made books but it seems like it\'s just a popularity contest on here, with the same story line and plots being used far too much.',
       'I love the idea of this game. But think it\'s absolutely stupid that everything costs so much gems and it ruins the whole game. You can pick any food choice bc you need 20 if not more gems and it happens so often. Would not reccomd this game TO ANYONE' ],

     [ 'Should be more opportunities to pick up extra coins.  Buildings should not require high numbers of colours that have had little or no play or a player should be able to move from previous cities what every they want not limited to 1000.  All in all I enjoy the game but it could be s bit friendlier.  Thank you',
       'Love this little game! I wish we had five life\'s, Three just gets me started. But overall, it\'s a great game. Getting like Candy Crush the higher the level the more impossible it gets to finish. Please don\'t make it so hard to win. I keep having to use coins to buy lives. Can never build up enough to amount to anything. Also you can give cash on the scratch off card. PLEASE !!!',
       'I love this game. It is the only one I have on my phone anymore. There are a few new issues though. When the scratch tickets come through, I can\'t send to friends. It freezes and the only way for me to get out of it is to close the app. I think we should be able to cash in the travel vouchers, in not for coins then at least boosts. I think I\'m on day 93 of the treasure chests, and like the fact that I don\'t have to pay for the chests anymore. What I don\'t like are the rewards from the chest. If for reaching the milestone on days checked in, like day 90 I am given less resources than the level I just played, I might as well just play the level and not bother with the chest. I do love the interesting facts given about the destinations though. I do think it would be beneficial to have a button where we can contact you within the game instead of having to post on the review platform.',
       'FIRST OF ALL THIS GAME CAN KISS MY HAPPY ASS !!!  I had completed Sydney & was almost finished with Tokyo.  I went to play the game & all of a sudden my game cleared & it  took me back to the first play on Sydney.I have no Sydney no Tokyo.I am pissed about this. I really enjoyed this game but, if this is the way  you operate then I am over this game for sure.....',
       'I like playing it very much. What I miss is the possibility of getting more of the real interesting facts  about cities I\'m in. In other words -I would like it to be more educational together with the fun of playing. I like as well that I can play it offline and then it is synced afterwords. I have non FB friends who play it and would like to  connect through this app- but it\'s not possible, is it? .Thanks',
       'Not enough lives....3 is mean. Don\'t know what the gems  that you win, or the student hats do. I haven\'t even cleared Sydney and levels are too hard to clear. Shame because I like the concept of going round the world. Sadly I will probably uninstall it over next few days. Life is too short.' ],

Please make an update where you can move these things while pets are out, or get my pet unstuck for me. Otherwise I won\'t be able to continue the game due the the inconvenience it\'s making.

Story part gets way too hard to manage keeping up with the difficulty even when you pay the subscription unless you spend real money to move along. It\'s a kids game, people don\'t have the money to keep up with the difficulty. I will be unsubscribing, subscription doesn\'t justify the price, everything costs too much and can\'t progress in the game because of price. Great game, shame it\'s destroyed by greed.',

     [ 'Two big parts of what I love about this game are its inclusivity in terms of skin tone and gender representation.   There are four different skin tones available to everybody in every situation. While there are many more variations in reality, it\'s refreshing to have more options than one.   Some items have gendered words in the their titles, but that doesn\'t restrict their usage at all. It\'s possible to mix and match anything and everything, regardless of each item\'s implied target gender.   I\'m not sure if these positive aspects were intended or not, but they make me feel included, which is more than I can say for most games.',
       'No trade system, Why!?! Plus the reply on boards doesn\'t notify the person you\'re replying to; you may want fix that eventually. But that aside this game is great it\'s very inclusive of plenty of different styles. They are lacking a bit on male items but they\'ve gotten better over the years! It\'s hard to get a high rank unless you slave over the game but you don\'t really need the events to get good items.',
       'WHAT THE HELL?! Why the hell don\'t I never get last day bonus- you know, when you\'re supposed to get 5 premium gacha tickets? I swear to god this game sucks more each time I see it.',
       'Fun app but I wish there was more interaction with other members. Also, there is a bug that doesn\'t allow the last 48 ticket to load and skips right to day one. It\'s a bad bug, so please fix it. I log in daily and still don\'t get my items',
       'Played for years and saw how much more unfair it is becoming, little by little.  If you\'re a free player, accept the fact you\'re probably not getting anything you want and definitely won\'t be at the top and maybe you can have some fun. Yes, apparently new players now get a lot of tickets and free stuff, but don\'t get used to it - that\'s just the bait to reel you in.  You\'re not exactly guaranteed to get anything if you pay every event/gacha//week as well, so keep that in mind before installing. This is the greediest game I\'ve ever seen.',
       'Good game, but I have a question. Whenever I try to purchase coins, it is telling me there was an error. I have tried redoing the information, and the card is fine, but the app will not allow me too buy any. Help?' ],

    description: 'Eternium is an amazingly fun and beautifully crafted Action RPG, reminiscent of the great classics.Eternium stands out from other mobile Action RPGs by its effortless “tap to move” and innovative “swipe to cast” controls, and its player-friendly “no paywalls, never pay to win” philosophy.With the exception of a couple of online-only features, the game can also be played offline after the content download completes.Drawing signs to cast spells is easy and rewarding. The tap-to-move control is more natural and relaxing than thumbsticks, and it’s also truer to the vintage point-and-click Action RPG experience.The game can be really played for free, as more than 90% of our players do. Purchases are completely optional. Gems, the game’s main currency, can be collected from enemies and quests. There is no limiting stamina or energy. The best things in the game are obtained by playing, not paying.Eternium has been launched in 2014, and is actively being improved by the original development team. Through years of polishing, and feedback from millions of players, the quality of the game has steadily increased, making it now one of the highest rated games on all app stores.As of fall 2017, major new features are in advanced stages of development, including real-time multiplayer, town portal, and a fourth world.Enjoy the visceral satisfaction of responsive, fast-paced combat, with spectacular special effects, pleasing sounds, rewarding damage numbers, all set against immersive backdrops and atmospheric, inspiring music scores.Play as a Mage, Warrior or Bounty Hunter, wielding a sword, axe, staff or gun. Level up to learn new abilities and increase your attributes.Battle skeletons, zombies, automatons, aliens, demons, dragons and many other creatures, across three beautifully hand-crafted worlds, or in endless generated levels.Venture into dark caves and dungeons, explore forests, villages and graveyards, lay siege to demon controlled castles, brave snowy mountain peaks, travel to the moon to slay strange creatures among craters and canyons, and beyond, to the deserts, pyramids and jungles of the red planet.Open treasure chests to loot gold, gemstones and battle gear. Equip shiny breastplates, menacing helmets and hoods, spiked shoulder pads, mysterious cloaks or capes. Protect yourself with a shield, or choose to wield two weapons as a warrior.Rescue your tank, healer and ranger companions who will join you in battle. Use their abilities together with yours to create rewarding and powerful tactical combos.Experience a refreshing storyline, filled with interplanetary intrigue and seasoned with funny characters. Hunt your arch-enemy, Ragadam, across the worlds, while trying to uncover and undo his twisted plans.Progress from common to rare, epic and legendary gear. Find gemstones that fit in your armor’s sockets. Craft socketed rings and amulets, and fuse three of them into a higher quality one.Unleash awesome offensive abilities, such as Whirlwind, Shockwave, Arc Lightning or Blizzard, control the enemy crowd with Frost Nova, Vortex, Silence, or sneak and assassinate with Smokescreen, Traps and Snipe.Each hero class has access to about 20 abilities (skills or spells), and each of your three companions has four more. The game starts simple, but culminates in a flurry of tactical possibilities at high levels.Once your hero reaches level 70, your experience points go into Champion Levels, which are unlimited and yield steady stat upgrades. Champion Levels are also inherited by your new heroes, so they will have an easier time growing up.Aside from the three story acts, an endless progression of beautiful, randomly generated levels awaits in the Trials of Valor game mode.Eternium is crafted with passion by a small band of old-school RPG fans, who love making the game they always wanted to play.',

     [ 'Greetings Making Fun,  Let me start off by saying that I absolutely love this game. It\'s entertaining, challenging and addictive. The storyline is engrossing and the graphics are spectacular as well. You can easily tell how addictive a game is by the amount of time you spend playing it at a stretch. Let me just say that I\'ve been playing this game ever since I installed it. Whenever I sit down with my device, I start playing it and I keep on playing for at least two hours before I divert my attention to other matters. It\'s a really lovely and delightful game. Making Fun seems like the most suitable title of the developers because they\'ve made something that is really a lot of fun. Well done. I highly recommend this game. DOWNLOAD IT TODAY.',
       'The gameplay is the best ive seen for an android RPG Diablo type game. Slick graphics, awesome sound track and effects, no slowdown and you can play offline!! Absolutely love the game. Only down side is the worry of repetitivness of the game but i guess only time will tell',
       'Incredible game. Very intuitive and unique with the swipe to cast system. The graphics are quite nice and the amount of memory the game uses is very acceptable for the quality you get. Music is very relaxing and well done. Level and NPC design are great, really feel like I\'m playing an old school medieval RPG. Absolutely 0 need to buy gems, the game gives them to you for just killing normal monsters. My only gripe would be to maybe add a fourth class? If not more in future updates. Otherwise, fantastic game, well put together, well written story, great opening scene and whoever did that voice over should be looking to do more! Thank you for making a true RPG for true RPG fans, keep it up!',
       'The game is addictive. I was hoping to play it offline all the time but you need and internet connection to upgrade skills and craft its annoying because I don\'t have wifi and I use mobile data. Still it gives me the feels of Diablo all over again.',
       'Nice game, but with little variety. The graphics are nice, the authors have a very honest approach to the game, making it more of a donation game than a greedy one. If you want to play without paying you can do it but you will spend a lot of time watching videos. Honest again, but it makes the levels a bit to long when you see all videos and ruins the game pace. In fact this is a 4 star game, even with the two negative points, but I give it 3 to lower the overall rating which I think it\'s a bit to high...',
       'The game itself is quite good. Control is so-so. I wish they had a control pad. But 3/5 the gems system force you to watch 5-6 videos in a 10 min run. If you don\'t you can\'t unlock team or spells etc. It remove the fun of the game after some hours. Can\'t recommend. Btw most ppl rate it 5 stars to get 50 gems. You see the pattern' ],

     [ 'I think this game is really good. I just have one problem. Even though it says my energy is full, it feels like I have nothing. And also the mini game 100 energy seems to last longer than the initial 300 you receive. If you could fix this taht would be great. And if it\'s designed like this can you make energy spending more efficient?',
       'Interesting story so far and great art but the energy runs out far to fast for you to really get very far, even at the beginning which is when the story needs to be able to draw the reader in so you want to come back and read more. Which is why I almost didn\'t continue and was thinking about just giving it up.  Not to mention the ads completely break up the flow of the story and you don\'t and can\'t even get energy from them.  So for these reason I give it a 3 even though I want to rate it as 5, but it\'s just to irradiating to ignore.',
       'This game really addictive!! The only problem is they don\'t give you enough energy.😒you either have to buy energy or play a mini game to get more energy. The highest energy points that you can get is 100. Plus the 30 points if you watch a video. Other than that the game is AMAZING. The graphics are realistic. It has a lot of romance too. You should definitely download this game if you\'re not bothered about the energy points.',
       'I m so excited to unveil what happens next, the energy drains hell too quick. I would love if the energy is increased to a lot more because that is effecting the gameplay and annoys me a lot personally. Leaving this issue, the game is fantastic. I have always loved choice games and this current gameplay is the best of all experiences . I wish to read more through your stories..... ❤',
       'The story-writing is really well done and the art is gorgeous. My only problem is that if you don\'t plan on spending money to buy energy, the story moves really slow even if you get full points on the card mini game and watch the offered video ad. I guess that\'s the idea, though, since it tempts one to spend the money to keep reading. I also get really confused with the plot, itself. Sometimes the direction it goes doesn\'t make sense to me and also, the choices sometimes do something I wasn\'t expecting at all given the wording.',
       'I love the game and the mystery. But I hate that I have so little energy and that I don\'t get to create how I look or see my reactions in anime. The energy thing is my main problem though why not let us gain more energy with more videos and games. I wanted more time. Really bummed 😔' ],

       'This game isn\'t so scary. Like u get scared when u nearly espaced bumping twice by any train, wall or signal and when u escape from death\'s hand. Rather than that it is game is very addicting and a fun game. Best part: 1) U get the interest of unlocking new characters. 2) It is offline. 3) U can buy the missions and skip them, if u can\'t fulfill them (only if have money). I love Subway Surfers.' ],

     [ 'The game is addictive it has nice communication between players and is over all fun. The only downside is how long it takes to get a combiner, and if I\'m going to spend money of coins on a crystal then it should be a guaranteed bot that you dont own',
       'It\'s a perfect game for people who love Transformers and all of it\'s different universes. It combines continuities like Beast Wars and the IDW comics into one game. Even with the game\'s amazing features, the game doesn\'t crash or lag when you play it. I am so happy that it\'s works for older generations of certain phones. One thing I am ready for, is to see the Shattered Glass universe to make an appearance.',
       'I enjoyed what this game has done with the RTS category. I really want a Trasformers game but in the playstyle of Halo Wars, which I find to be really enjoyable. I love the graphics and the though I have to say when you get better Transformers it can take a while before you can battle again. I would recommend this game if you like Clash of Clans and other games of this type. I also really enjoy the little events that this game gives along with a trial of the new Transformers to test. This is a great time killer and with Optimus or Megatron sounding off before you attack it just makes me that more determined to win the fight. Overall fantastic game and a great dev team thank you',
       'I am changing my review of this game. It is fun to play, but very disappointed in the amount of duplicate bots I get after earning shards. I am almost to the point of stopping play of this game because of not getting new characters on a regular basis. Very frustrating. I will give 5 star again when this gets fixed. I am lacking many characters and shouldn\'t be getting duplicate 3 and 4 star bots.',
       'Decent game.  Robot abilities grant surprisingly deep combat tactics.  Loot box system is skewed to make you spend money on a crystal 3 or 4 times to get the bot you\'re paying for.  Otherwise would be 5 star.  Don\'t spend cybercoins till you but a 3rd builder.',
       'Your duplication rate is ridiculous. If I\'m spending money on it, I should have a better chance of getting bots I need than someone on free to play. Also your events are meh. Way to club us over the head with a carrot dangled from a stick of things we will never see like 5* bots or the new Prime cores.' ],

     [ 'COMING SOON: The Power of the Primes is here! Channel the awesome abilities of the ancients using Prime Cores. Each Prime Core is unique and contains the essence of a particular Prime, resulting in new powerful capabilities for your bots that go far beyond what can be achieved with a normal Power Core.',

     [ 'Great game. Loving it. I noticed when you go into the Alter, there is a note telling you your capacity limit at the bottom but in the Mana gem screen it doesn\'t tell you. Are you able to add this feature? I can never remember my mana creating limit.  If you make more mana than can fit in your mana storage line, you lose the excess.',
       'AWESOME!!! Originally, I was very reluctant to download this becuase I though it was going to be where you just sit and watch your character do everything for you. I HATE those types of games... This however is actually how I was really hoping it would turn out to be! You can move freely! The levels are linear and its not very open, but thats okay! You see each piece of equipment on your character when you wear it, which is absolutely essential to me! I will not play a game where my appearance does not change, so this has all in all met my expectations! Another RPG worthy of my collection! Thank you!!!',
       'I have a problem I like you guys to look at I have (very strong 72mps wifi) and I got an error code:93 that why I put 4/5 because this is a big issue I can\'t turn on the app! I like this app but I can\'t even play now I tried restarting/wifi,my device nothing is working what can u do to fix it myself if possible for me to do anything to make it work?',
       'Save your money.  This game is FAR from free.  It\'s repetitive and too expensive.  When you try to do the side tasks to earn diamonds (in game currency you\'d otherwise spend way too much cash on) they find ways to not pay you. I\'m owed over 800 diamonds and they\'re telling me to contact someone else.  Absolutely not worth it. Like I said, this game is FAR from free and the ways to increase game play currency within are false advertising, which the outright refuse to take responsibility for or correct.  Trust me. Save your money and play a different game from a different developer.',
       'Every time there\'s an update you get thrown backwards X 10! I was movin along at a steady pace but now since the update I havent been able to advance 1 area! Even the arena battles arent winnable. Not fun at all anymore. This coming from someone who played religiously every day for 6 months or longer 👎',
       'It was bad enough what the update did to players characters.......but after your patch to supposedly take into account players objections about how their characters statistics were lowered,  my character lost another power level and 2 million in power after the patch. Absolutely pathetic how you have treated the players who have played this game. Perhaps I should contact some of my friends that are Bratva to represent me and voice my complaints. Have a nice day!' ],

     [ 'There really isn\'t anything negative to say about "Moe! Ninja Girls" the story is great, every character is deep and likeable, even if you\'re a free player each chapter is long enough to keep you coming back and paying is definitely worth it,too. It looks great and sounds great to boot. I honestly don\'t like mobile games at all but this is amazing and would be even it were a console or pc game. To me this is THE perfect app on mobile so download it now! And devs: I hope you continue to support the game because if you guys keep making seasons,I\'ll keep playing. Love you guys! &lt;3',
       'The story is really the best part of the whole game. The ninja fighting seems to be arbitrary , as you can have high stats and still lose a match. Collecting new gear is fun but you don\'t get as much new gear as you would like. Sometimes the game stretches the abilities of my Amazon fire eight and crashes under Google Play add in. This story definitely makes it worthwhile playing though it\'s funny and titillating!  ;-)',
       'This is an updated version. My last post was from I think September or maybe October, but this game is truly AMAZING!!! The story line itself is great as well as the side story\'s that you can read as well. This game has changed so much from when I started playing this game in August. The events are great but I think the developers can give a little bit better rewards then just XP juice and more jewels as well as heart stamina, but other than that the game is perfect no glitches and non of that stuff. The one year anniversary was amazing thank you for that!! I can\'t wait for season 10 and the future seasons of Moe Ninja Girls!!!',
       'Amazing story! Great characters. Other similar apps dont compare. Im playing completely free so far, just finished Season 1, and many awesome event stories. Well worth my time. Yes you have to wait 4 hours between chapters, but who cares. Its actually a nice pace.',
       'Cute anime girls. Only things is that the gameplay was really simple. I\'ve played some dating games before and usually there\'s more options or they appear more frequently. And the ninja fight mini game was also simple. I don\'t know. This game seems to get good reviews so maybe it\'s just me.',
       'This game really gets me. Everytime something happens without having to choose an answer it still makes me feel like it would be something I would do. And all the characters have their own type of characteristics, unlike other games I play that are like this that have all the characters acting the same way.' ],

     [ 'My only issue with this game is that u almost have to end up purchasing tix to continue to play. The further u move on in the game, the more tix each card costs & ur only given a certain amount thru a daily reward. App should provide ways to earn more tix, either thru a daily spin or higher rewards. *(since app developer replied to this review, I changed my review to 4 stars)',
       'Just played my first 4-5 rounds and this ROCKS! Not too fast. I love it! Fair Payouts but 1st, 2nd, etc same as others. Graphics work!  All Around impression... Awesome-ness. Update: I\'ve been here atleast  5mos... long enough to know this still ROCKS!',
       'I really like this Bingo  game.  A few upgrades and it will  be better than all the other Bingo games.  I love the amount of tickets it gives you to play.  I love the extra stuff you can earn and not have to pay for.  A couple of things that would  make this game better would be all 4 cards on one screen in tablet mode, the power ups being applied automatically  and being able to daub that last number that\'s  called cause usually that\'s the one needed for Bingo.  Otherwise its great.  I hope  you find this useful.  I understand  if you can\'t  fix all three of these but the first 2 are more important  than the last and i understand  there can only be a certain amount of bingos i guess.  Thank you.  Real close to being a 5 but those 3 issues really hold me back as I\'m  sure it does others as well.',
       'I like this game VERY much. But my tickets keep disappearing! I just earned 200 tickets for feeding the dog. My tickets got added on. Then i clicked on Candy Crush. Then i clicked on 4 cards. And it said i didn\'t have enough tickets! It cost 240 in Candy Crush. I had almost 300 tick. When i looked at the top, i only had 131. What happened to all my tickets that quick?!?!? I\'m about to uninstall now. Its not the FIRST time this happened. But it will be the last! #GoodbyeBingo',
       'This used to be my favorite bingo game and then they updated it about a month ago (give or take a few days). Before the update, I was able to level up daily or every other but, now, it takes me a GOOD week or more to level up. That was my ONLY way to gain more tickets to continue playing without purchasing. I barely have enough to play 2 (4 cards each) rounds each day! REALLY stinks! Guess I will be uninstalling and going back to playing Bingo Blitz!',
       'It\'s been nice...I\'m happy to share: they heard us. We can earn power now, the games are fun, excellent pace. Thank you "Dataverse", I appreciate your changes 💯 ☠☠☠☠☠ UPDATE: n again 1/11. again: I ventured and came back. I can buy credit in January. Cuz we HAVE to have boosts to play long.

     [ 'Having to factory reset my phone of course deletes the game. So I redownload and sign in with my email as usual. Only for my account to be gone tried the facebook method plus redownloading the app and nothing happened. 2 years plus  down the drain how especially if it was linked to my email and play games account, I don\'t understand. Sent the dragon soul support team a email with all requested information and got an automated "we\'ll be reviewing your the matter and thank you for your patience". Umm hope so I spent to much way to much time with too much to lose. Dragon soul please fix this 🙏 I LOVE THIS GAME IT\'S LIFE!!! *If issue is resolved I will put up a great and positive review*.',
       'changing my rating. dropping it lower due to the length of time ive been playing this game and the very frustrating rate at which rng effects a pay to win game.  this game at high end game levels is more rng than anything and not worth spending another dime on.',
       'Infuriating exploit. One of which is when you encounter a 2 roster team in expedition mode that is maxed level and tiered. The overall power of such team is lowered, due to only have 2 heroes, thus allowing you to encounter them. However their maxed level and tier make them unbeatable vs your team of 5 non-maxed heroes.  Please fix this by implementing a mandatory requirement of having 5 heroes in every expedition team.',
       'I had this game rated 5 stars. I have been playing for 2 years. I spend about $100 or so a month on this game (by choice, to support development). On the last update, I had $200 worth of items bug out and all I get is the runaround from the support staff. When my items are replaced, I will go back to 5 stars and a positive review. I love this game and it\'s unfortunate that I feel slighted. I\'ve never had to write a ticket in 2 years until this issue. And all I get is a cut and paste response. For those of us out here legitimately trying to support this game, you figure that there would be a better sense of urgency to please your customer. It\'s not like I am asking for something for free or trying to scam you. All I am asking is that, I open my mail one morning and SURPRISE, find that the company has replaced the items that were lost in a glitch/bug, that were paid for. When that happens, I will go back to spending money on this game, because it is worth it.',
       'The game is impossible. They keep up grading it and you can\'t maximize your hero\'s. Don\'t bother wasting your time with this game. It\'s senseless.',
       'A great game overall, but crashes CONSTANTLY. I send the crash report plenty. I do want to put time into the game, but if you have no patience for this stuff, I highly suggest not playing it.' ],

     [ 'Very easy laid back excellent game. Love playing any time I\'m free. Wish I could play all day. Plus it gives you plenty of smaller things  to do to improve the islands. Just wish yoou could use the store on more than the love island. Would love to see the island\'s stay open until finished. Hope they add more special items and get upgrades to specials. The name is cute, and so are the little characters. Would love to see more water wells on every map. I am addicted already. Can\'t wait to see what spring will have.',
       'I love this game. I am always looking forward to the challenges of the new worlds .I am so happy to discover the new worlds. I am very excited to see the next world . But it  leaves you wandering when my zombie is going to find his true love . and when does he become human and in what world 🌎 . for now i am waiting for a 🌎 to open up.I look forward to the new updates and I enjoy leaving the world completely empty .The updates are fun new worlds. I enjoy this game and i don\'t get bored.',
       'Another greedy game developer, who makes it impossible to get anywhere,  with out spending real money. 15 min into It, out if swords...guess what??? Gotta buy them to get any farther!  I never download games anymore, because the greed of you people make me sick. Don\'t download this if you don\'t wanna spend mad of your hard earned money to play some game you will eventually get bored with.',

All the updates are terrific. you just keep making it better and better. Way to hooked on my little zombie guy. Can\'t put him down.',
       'I love this game. It\'s my sons, but I play it more than him! Tech always helps quickly with any issues! I wish there were more ways to get tools without buying them. There aren\'t enough tool wells etc. Still not enough free options for tools! It takes too long to get them. I think the new levels like grotto use too many tools and too many resources. Takes forever and i tend to not want to keep playing now as much',
       'Very entertaining.  Perfect for stress release. Love to play. Added 12-16-16, one of the most original and most of all no technical issues like I have with New World and Westbound.  2/2/2017 continues to be the best game around,no errors  or glitches. Excellent graphics and very entertaining. 4/28/2017 this is truly THE # 1 game. 5/31/2017 continues to be the best and #1 game around. 3/1/18 Still the best game around.🤗' ],

       'Until an update like 3-4 months ago everything was ok, you could chose between battle mode and stage mode, both were equaly rewarding, you wanted gold you went for battle mode, you wanted crystals you went for stage mode. Now stage mode is a joke, it\'s so hard that is not worth it. Please fix this, either increase the rewards or reduce the dificulty.  Also a good idea would be to add a market where you could sell/exchange materials for other materials.',
       'Game is completely balanced around p2w. Takes forever to get anywhere or do anything.  The world bosses are a joke,  they are once a day for a couple of minutes.  So basically hard to catch.  It\'s beyond a grindfest. Moving up and doing anything becomes more of a pain than in game fun',
       'In world raid dragon keeps hitting me all good then bang out of nowhere hits me again with 4000 health and I lose. What\'s up with this? Before the update its fine now I\'m dying like crazy from 4000 health to 0 in one hit doesn\'t make sense. FIX THIS PLEASE was lots of fun with new mode now dying real fast for tons of health lot less fun :(',
       'I loved Defender 2, but this game did not live up. They made it way more complicated than it needs to be for the kind of game it is. Feels more pay-to-win too than the other ones. Stick with Defender 2. Uninstalled by stage 11.',
       'I love this game and have made a purchase or two, but it drives me nuts that the game keeps crashing on me.  It turns the screen of the game and locks up, sometimes it comes back and sometimes I have to restart the phone.  I don\'t know what causes this but it\'s infuriating.

Im also becoming abit bored by the game because the cars i have left to by can only be acquired via tokens or cash. Not everyone can afford to pay continuous amounts to get further in a game. Scrap the cash and reward good driving. By the way, this is the best game 🇿🇦I\'ve ever played',

I got a offer to buy a car in the game, limited time offer it said only 10,000 tokens, so I looked up how much that was out of curiosity? $149! Are you for real? Someone must be on drugs to come up with these prices. I just feel sad for the ones that do pay for these so called offers. May Gameloft be cursed until you take away your greed.',

Maybe every 40 levels add a mill purchase option. When selling on the market, we need an option for a blind add or a neighborhood only sell or trade.. make these upgrades and so far game would be perfect!',
       'It\'s great to be able to buy from other farms in theory. But there are WAY too many times that you click on something and it\'s either sold or not even in the roadside stand at all. The for sale paper needs to update quicker.  Also, it\'s very hard to accumulate any \'west bucks\' in this game and you need them to do almost anything, so the game is a big money suck too. I\'m deleting it.',
       'I love these type of games just like hayday. I have noticed it freezes and takes ages to load the newspaper. Also would be helpful if it could tell you who needs help in the newspaper would help filling orders quicker. Also I have noticed alot of people selling the same parts and harder to get others and it\'s extremely rare to get the land parts without paying',
       'Update......I have learned there is a chat feature AND a neighborhood group you can create.....so excited to get to level 19!!!! Would give it a solid 5 stars if we could have an actual chat option with friends. Looking for a new game to get away from FV2, but can\'t find one with the same chat availability.  Add this and I am hooked!',
       'The game doesnt give enough case vs things to buy or fix.  Also have issues with getting product into the alloted spaces.  I thought it was my screen but had it cleaned thoroughly and it still happens.  It takes several attempts!!!  The story is cute.  The graphics are cute as well.  Ive noticed it has a couple of choices from other games Ive played on older phones. I would suggest the game to others but get the issues fixed and itll be a 5star game.',
       'I love playing these games. I\'m not sure why we are rating gameplay they offer apps not a game. It\'s crazy how they ask us to rate game at the beginning of game. We haven\'t learned the bad points. This game makes us pay for treasure chest instead of giving us to them free like most games. Which means we have to pay for everything. Totally not fair. Takes the fun out of game.' ],

I would have liked if they had subtitles to the songs so we know what they are singing. Also give us a chance to earn more gems and scouting tickets.The scouting I think is also not fair. I would scout single ten times and not get anything but a rare. While my friends do single scouts and get ur and SSR. YOU won\'t get goods cards unless you pay or do the 11 scout. The pricings also could be improved',
       'Warning! This game is freakin\' addictive. Good graphic with cute characters. Recommended for anyone who loves idol genre ... Suggestion: please fix the lagging.

One thing I\'m really picky on is that you press the circle on the beat and this is the only game so far that has stayed true to all the notes being on the EXACT beat. Other games don\'t do that and it bothers me to no end bc I don\'t know when to press but this game is great and I love it dearly. Also cute girls.',

Thirdly, SRs and URs is also supposed to be hard to get too, because there wouldn\'t be any fun without them.' ],

If you could positing each operator where you like, would make the game very good. The developers need to sort the bugs out and the black squares with software freezing.',
       'To anyone having the "already logged in on another device" issue: I fixed this on my Samsung Galaxy S4 Active by going to the app information and hitting the "clear cache" and "clear data" buttons. Apparently that worked. Can\'t guarantee it\'ll work for everyone but try this if you have an android! :-) This game is awesome!',
       'The game is really good. To spend your time, it\'s kinda addictive. The only drawback I found with this game is that the cost of upgrades when compared to the payouts after the missions is way too less. This is good game but needs improvements on this. Hoping that you\'ll will work on it. Also the wait time between missions is way too much time. Needs improvement on this as well.',
       'UPDATE now I keep getting connection error....!! Awesome game. New job wait time is a little too long but I understand they need to make money. The game is very playable without spending money still. Haven\'t had a forced add yet so that\'s alway a plus.',
       'Cool game in general, you don\'t have to spend real money to play or advance, but it helps. My only real complaint is constant "Connection Error" messages. One after another, sometimes in the middle of a mission or right after completing one before it saves. I\'ve had to stop playing before for over an hour, error code after error code after error code. Close app and reopen, error code, even when on Wi-Fi. Next time I\'m deleting the app.',
       'The game is too good bt has a lot to improve. First and foremost ....the game\'s new mission take a hell lot of time to appear. U shud better do away with time gaps for mission. N the other issue is the sudden termination of game at times. It stops suddenly while start of a mission. The gap in new missions really lets die doen the interest in the game. Hope u see to it.' ],

     [ 'Oh my god, this is definitely the best game on the appstore. I thought I was never going to see another game that was not a arcade or a god awful clicker game ever again. Ponos if you\'re reading this thank you so much for bringing something new to the appstore. It is based on strategy which you rarely see. It\'s not as fun or addictive as other games, but it still deserves a point for being fresh. The title speaks for itself, you make cats battle. And the aren\'t even there which is proof of how confident Ponos is with their game. They clearly have experience and if I\'m wrong I would be blown away. Overall I believe it\'s good to see something fresh and I want this to continue so keep it up.',
       'Can you make a way so we can save our progress on face book or google. Also add battle cats pop features like an option to make the death animation splating on the screen and also custom pvp modes that you can play with friends or a random guy who has a similar amount of trophies or whatever? That would make the game fun and exciting!',
       'It deleted all my stuff I almost  beat the stupid chapter 3 moon! I had all my cats upgraded to level 20 all of them! This game is stupid don\'t  download it this game is stupid  I want to like it but they deleted my account i want my account help me ponos I want my game. Back',
       'I love all of the units and levels! However, I do have one issue, and that is that there is no cloud save. I had an account where I had beaten all cyclones, main chapters, and through ururun wolf stage. I also had 6 ubers and all rare cats hyper maxed. This account was accidentally deleted, leaving me back at the start of the game. Even with this one flaw, it is still probably my favorite mobile game.',
       'PONOS I LOOOOOVE THIS GAME. I have played since 2014, and I have not stopped(switched devices). I only have one thing I wish you guys could do.  Please collab with Regit. Thanks for an amazing game which never disappoints.  Togelan my boi',
       'I love this game. It\'s very fun and very addictive. There is only one gripe I have with the game; there\'s no multiplayer. I would really like to see co-op and/or pvp options. I love this game a lot, but it can be so much better with these multiplayer options.' ],

       'This game is complete trash, the mechanics are not balanced, the skill pairing is not properly compared you constantly get matched with players that have 3-4 tiers higher than your equipment, this game almost makes it impossible to play unless you spend $200-$600 a month just so you might get something worthwhile.',

     [ 'This game is very fun and addictive but should have offline mode so we don\'t have to deal with a hacker every game.  Also after new update I\'m having issues getting into the game. It says "check comnection" and my connection is fine even tried uninstalling it and all. Other games work on my phone and so does my Wi-Fi. The game just worked last night for me now it doesn\'t! PLEASE FIX!!',
       'Could you please add an offline mode...would be nice to practice on the go. Also please please please add more guns. I have been playing this game for a year and still no new guns but glad you are keeping up with the maps. I have this HUGE problem, it says check connection when I have good connection. I tried to restart my phone and reconnect but still doesn\'t work. PLEASE FIX.',
       'Just good. This game is great. The controls are completely customizable so you can make it work the way you want it to. Graphics are on point, better than 2nd Gen consoles, lesser than 3rd gen. If this game came out in the age of the PS2 I would have bought it. Also, buy a box because this game couldn\'t have been cheap to make. This game should cost like $25.',
       'its a great game. i loved it , but old brewery map was better than the new one ,that was my favourite but after the latest update it had  been altered and this "new brewery" is not liked by gamers, all of them want the old one brewery ,old one was awesome ,so much fun , i wanna request you to please. change the new brewery with old one we all commented to u and complained about this. many of my friends uninstalled critical ops  we all are waiting for the old brewery i wish you will make a read at all the comments and take the required action against it with in time ..........',
       'I loved the game before. It was one of the best fps game I have ever seen. But after the ban in pc you guys have lost a lot of players. And I too now hate the game. It was moreover greater than counter strike go, but after the ban you guys made all of us disappointed. If you would have continued with this game on pc I am surely telling that this would be known as people\'s choice game. So please consider to it and bring back this game on pc.  Thank you,  Your great full player',
       'I love this game....  But I would like if there we can play offline....  And there is so many hackers!!!!!!  Try to band them..... And please Change that there is two missions in a day so we can open chest.....  So we can get skins...... Please..... Thank u of u guys change....  Love this game....  It\'s like counter strike...... And one more old take off the lag I can\'t take it......' ],

     [ 'It takes too long to train players up. Training facilities are not really as effective as they should be and it takes an age to increase even young players by half a star so they might as well do away with training and increasing players rating cos u never keep a player for longer than a season or so before they become redundant. Other than that one aspect of the game it\'s actually really fun and I enjoy it.',

     [ 'After playing now for a while, I really like the game, but cost way too much to be able to really play and advance, only given 4 free rolls an hour, cannot do anything with that, rolls should be free. I have spent a lot of money buying gems so I could buy rolls in order to really play the game. I think it is unfair to your customers. Should be set up better for people to be able to enjoy the game without costing a small fortune.',
       'I like this game a lot and its fun but  it\'s a little more on the pay to win side,  the amount of time you have to wait for rolls is so annoying especially during events. I understand why some apps need to be pay to win but I just think it needs to be toned down a bit.  Another issue I have noticed is that 80% of the time ads freeze in the middle of playing so I end up having to close the game and try again.  Other than that it\'s very fun to play in my spare time and the graphics are very cute and vibrant.',
       'I\'m having 2 problems with the game. 1: whenever my bunnies have rolls to give me, and I tap to get them, I don\'t actually receive them. They vanish. 2: When im visiting someone else\'s board, the game crashes and I lose everything I got into that board such as money, conquered buildings and gems.  It\'s driving me crazy. Also, I would like for the rolls to recharge every 30 minutes, 1 hour is too much time. I love this game, so addictive.',
       'I bought a deal in the shop and got extra coins as a prize since my coins spiked to around 1million. Never got a notice saying i got these coins i just happened to notice and was like what the heck, is this a glitch? Then realized it was probably the prize i could get with purchase. 800k was then stolen before i had a chance to use them. We are talking the window of 20sec or less without ever logging off. So I spent actual money on this game and didn\'t get to use the stuff i spent money on. Poor design that you can have something you paid for stolen within seconds of the purchase.',
       'You\'re stealing money from our board! I have 2 accounts, one facebook and one gmail. I am playing with my gmail account when I got 86k+ from my facebook account because i landed on steal. Upon checking my facebook account, 127k+ was stolen from me. There is such a huge difference from the money. We spent gems to buy rolls for the upgrade yet you\'re stealing our money. Explain. I have screen shot on my facebook account notification on 127k deducted to my account. Too bad i didn\'t take one on the 86k because i didn\'t think that this will happen.',
       'The game is decent, the idea is wonderful. But i have one prpblem, the wait time for moves is horrendous, it would be better if you got more moves per hour or if the time was just shorter in general. You wait for and hour to blow through your moves in 5 seconds. Please fix this' ],

     [ 'Overall the game itself is pretty good and worth the download for a good couple hours of fun even with a few friends. However I would highly recommend not spending any money on the in game purchases. I got ripped off, luckily with in game currency only and the "game team" is adamant that nothing went wrong. If that is the type of support they give I wouldn\'t want something to go wrong with my actual money. So long story short as long as u don\'t spend money u should have a good time playing',
       'Love the game defiantly 5* just a couple of comments I hope get read it would be nice to gain some coins through friendly battles with people in your clan. Also if you could see when your group member\'s were last active it would be easier to sort out our clans. Thanks',
       'Pay to play, unplayable if you don\'t pay. Got to level three and could no longer match against anyone lower than level 8 so I never had a chance.',
       'I fall in love with this game !!! Amazing combination of card and strategy game. Very nice, quick and enjoyeble gameplay. Customer Support is very reliable and very helpfull. Do you really need money, or Legendaries !? No, you dont !!! I got to castle 8 (3000 Trophies) in 3 weeks with no money and no Legendaries !!! The only thing you need is to have a reliable, supportive clan !!! Dont miss any chests, create consistent deck and have a good decision making in game !!! Have Fun Guys !!! xD',
       'Game is addictive but i feel that some time mana comes fast some time not also game is providing some cards to some special zones person only so decreasing my stars from 5 to 4 by editing..... Sorry growth in game after level 6 becomes slow not happy with that',

     [ 'It was a great game until they introduced Deathstroke. Now you either need to have him(I do but it takes the fun away) or have people specifically to counter him. They made him way OP and arnt nerfing him anytime soon. So if your just starting you will want to spend money to counter death stroke.',
       'Ok, maybe this is a minor nitpick. But some of the legendary costumes look really bad. It is worse on characters that look good before the upgrade. The detective Batman and comic Harly Quinn are the biggest examples. I would rate higher if they gave us the ability to hold the apperance. Maybe add another level and costume and let players choose which they like best.',
       'Had to change my score after playing this game for almost a year. For more than a year this game hasn\'t done a single update. We still playing the same tired and boring game modes. No character rebalancing, no new gamemode all the do is introduced new broken character every month to get you to buy them and completely nerfs them the next month\'s just to introduce another broken character. Do not spend money on this game EVER.',
       'Very frustrating:  NO customer support at all - nobody checks or answers feedback infinite fights: you\'d better not end up in a fight with batman dark night vs green lantern hal jordan at similar level - cause nobody can win - you can only give up and lose your ressources!!! Update: they changed Lobo again. The most helpful one against Deathstroke. Now his revives are limited to 3. Additionally: the new heroes are unusually strong and frustrating against the old ones. Frustrating for old players.',
       'So i love this game. But it\'s strict. I deleted the Google Play Games app cause i needed space and thought it was useless.

My biggest gripe is that the "read more" section states that it comes with unlimited practice deals but this is not true and each practice game costs a "deal credit".

Every time I would submit for help I would get a generic answer. Once I threatened to quit the game for good the answer changed. The problem hasn\'t been resolved but they are "working" on it. If it isn\'t resolved soon my time and money will find a new game!  New update as of 2/15/18. I invest money in this game but I am not able to utilize the upgraded hero\'s...they have disappeared. I complete tasks with no rewards. I submit help tickets that get ignored.

     [ 'This is my new favorite game. I love the heroes and the quests. It\'s fun trying to get the best heroes and build the perfect team. My only issue with this game is that it sometimes shuts down while I\'m building a team for a quest or right after the quest before I can collect the rewards. It has shut down at least 4 times today alone. I hope this stops happening after the next update.',
       'Game is horrible,everything is rng based,and i mean everything. Gacha is the worst compared to any game released and i dont mean spend 30$ and complain,spent over a thousand in 2 momths to try for 1 of 2 main healers and still nothing combined with regular diamond income,meaning none of the top connects are doable. Arenas and events are all pvp or ranked vs top players where you stand no chance what so ever. Overall this games horrible and not worth your time or money.',
       'Too much for F2Ps! The first time I installed VC, everything was fine. No much competition and less people are salty. But now, with ATeam\'s surge of incoming *better* units... F2P players always feel left out. Could you try at least giving us an exclusive 5* unit again for free (like your Anniversary Ticket) or least make a 5* appear in your Star Party guaranteed pull? Hehehe.',
       'Very money hungry game.  I play sw. Which was bad nat 5 rates but this one take it to next level making new heroes op and rendering old heroes obsolete  while takes 200 dollars or more to get new heroes. At leaset in games like sw they balance the heroes',
       'It\'s a fantastic game. The only problem I have come across is the summoning function. When I was able to do my first summon, I got a few rare characters and I was happy about that. Then I saw this summoning event where I could get some special units, so I saved up the in-game currency to summon them. When I did summon, I got some of the same characters I had summon before. To back up my suspicions, I restarted the game several times to get the currency to summon again and kept getting the same seven "Super Rare" units. The game itself is almost a solid 5 for me but the odds of getting a promoted unit through a summon will probably disappoint.',

     [ 'Such a shame. The game is great, really enjoyed the concept however it is a prime example of how monetisation strategy can ruin a game. Gems too difficult to earn without buying them, and purposely easy to accidentally spend them. Too many ads too. I\'d rather have paid for the game. Deleted it after a  day or so.',
       'Not What It Used To Be  The second to last update I did for this app switched the aim of the ball to slightly off from where you point it. So now have to compensate (guess a bit) when you\'re aiming which makes play more challenging.  Likewise, levels beyond about 440 are becoming impossible to beat w/o saving like a weeks with of bonuses to use on each level. Beating one level a week is hardly fun anymore! I may be uninstalling this app soon.',
       'Game has so much potential and is a blast. I\'m giving it a bad rating because gems are insanely expensive and they have so many buttons to hit to "use 200 gems to remove 3 lines" as one example or another to lose 200 by placing the button right above the back button on a phone. Super lame move on devs to intentionally take insanely expensive gems from us by mistake. No confirmation or anything, just boom, gone. Lacks ethics to say the least rinow',
       'Games fine. I refuse to rate a game well when it\'s annoying ads start pushing political agenda against gun owners. Will go elsewhere',
       'Great game.   But one of the adverts is a virus.   The IG Academy advert wrecked my game and now my phone\'s being a pain in the ass',
       'I really this game, plenty of challenging levels, very addictive for sure. I just got a new phone and was bummed to have to start all over (had gotten to level 360) but my new phone came with an updated/better version so now I\'m stoked on it all over again. Sometimes I wanna quit this game but I never do.' ],

     [ 'I know the update on The Book of Dragons came out a long time ago, but I still can\'t make sense of it. The old book of Dragons was a lot easier to understand. If you filtered it to show only searchable dragons, then it would show in order what you unlock. I\'m not sure, but from what I understand is that the dragons are now arranged in time to search. That\'s neat and all, but could you please come out with a filter for dragon unlocsks by Lvl?  Dragons unlocked at a later Lvl is usually better. With the current filter, you can find a dragon which collect 14 mill wood/hour with dragons collecting 1.05 mill wood because it is arranged by time to search. Again, please release a filter option by Lvl unlocked? Thanks for your help!',
       'The new update is nice, except for the iron storage downgrade. Why the hell would you downgrade from 45k to 10k??? Rest of iron in mail, all 30000 of it!!! Why, thank you , it\'s good to know that I will be able to keep 5000 iron AND LOSE 25K WHEN I CLAIM THE PACK IN MY MAIL. Now I have to keep the mail iron and collect more over days on end to make the next iron storage upgrade.... seriously??? At least divide the iron into packs of say 3k each so that it\'s usable. The fact that the iron storage was downgraded is bad enough, but 30k iron in email when storage is reduced to 10k sucks!!!!  Update: claimed the extra iron. It ended up split into packs of 5000 iron in mail. Little happier now',
       'Dont bother doing any of the offers for free runes as soon as you go forward to complete any when you go back to the game they all disappear so you just end up wasting all your time pointlessly playing games you wouldnt be caught dead playing normally. In general this game just relies wayyyyyy too much on being a pay to play, but it couldve been actually a really fun game if it wasnt for those facts',
       'I really prefer  the old version of  this game like how you\'d have a dragon and you\'d guard a wagon and collect gold and fish and some time a new egg. And if a dragon attacked you\'d battle it and have to tilt your tablet to fly aim you fire blasts.could you add a dragon racing minigame',
       'I love it even if it\'s not real I don\'t care though and I think it could use an update about more dragons and more offers about coins and ruins but free ones cause no likes spending money on games unless they last forever so keep up that good work.  And one more update that the dragon and grand dragons like foreverwing and more but make them cheaper with ruins and what ever more .  And I love the game u should get it.',
       'Game is a good time killer, but getting anywhere in the Jerk at Work is almost impossible. 3 waves of enemies above my level and the only way I can even the odds is if I pay for sage fruit. That is far too stupid and dumb. Thanks for being impossible to beat. UGH' ],

     [ 'Got too allgegro madness. And got stuck with the no face cards. 14 cards is alot to get. In fairway blast the card suits stick until a new none face card comes up, or reshuffles them. I find with this game they dont stick when the next card is turned over. So your run ends. And the run cards you ave accumulated as returned back to one agan.',
       'I totally love this game, but there\'s always aye glitch and then it blanks out so I have to reinstall the app multiple of times so I could keep playing.. So maybe admin you could take a look at it for us please as I would totally love to keep playing this game as its a great game to play especially when your winning down after such along day.. Thanks',
       'It\'s a fun game!! can keep you very entertained only thing that sucks is if you have it on PC or iOS there are way more features and it\'s way better than the Android version!!😢 So the side note is for the developers at Big Fish Games....... So I think we\'ve all waited way too long it\'s time to step it up and come out with a greater Android version at least make it as good as the iOS version!!!!!?????',
       'People will tell you that it\'s good for your brain or that it\'s fun, but that really isn\'t true, especially since it won\'t even allow you to turn off hints. Immediately after you make a move, you can\'t even think for yourself and try it alone. It\'s annoying. Don\'t get it. Go to a different solitary game.',
       'I love solitaire games, but this game is impossible. The first rounds will be easy, and then you\'re hit with ridiculous difficulty and straight up unwinnable games, that is, unless you spend money to get power ups that shouldn\'t even be necessary. 100% pay to win game. Which I find very sketchy. I\'ll never download anything from these developers ever again.',
       'PLEASE change where the 5 extra card for 2000 bucks is! I love this game but when you\'re short on money and you accidentally press it.... aaaaarggh. I\'m pretty sure others don\'t like where it is either. Could be a perfect game. And I spend hours a day on it as I\'m bedbound. Please...' ],

EDIT: Playtika has opened all the games up again and my progress has been restored. Thanks',
       'Not bad game but payouts suck. When you start the new contest you were able get the hidden parts now after a few days they show up less and less and to get the ones you need to complete the levels it appears the only way is to buy they through the more expensive packages. Not a fan.',

     [ 'I love the game. Wish we didnt have to pay for every secret scene and had a little bit more energies before having to wait for more or buy some. Would be great if we had more options for free energy. Love the story and characters. Hurry with season two already!!!  Im anxious to see further stories on ryan and the character Lol ❤.',
       'I absolutely love the story line and I\'ve spent more on the game than I\'d like to admit. But spending money doesn\'t really get you much farther because the energy goes so quickly. I think you would get far better reviews and more happy customers if you got rid of the energy system and upped the ads for more revenue from that standpoint. Then you could keep the micro transactions for the secret scenes. This way you\'d still be making money,  but your customer retention would go up. I have so many ideas that would help this app out and I\'d love to share them as I love this story. If you are interested in what I have to say please reply',
       'It\'s really a good game. It\'s awesome! But that energies are my main problem! Don\'t you think that...... only 300 energies that means only 30 lines are not enough and too little for a day..!?..!???!.. and 10 energies per line isn\'t too much!!??! Please make it down to 5 energies for each lines...and only for dialogues.. And if you give 500 or 100 energies (if 1 line cost 5 energies then there will be only 100 or 200 lines. Not much for a whole day!!!!!) and take 10 hours to get free energies again then the game will be perfect!! Everyone can\'t buy energies (including me)! You know! Please consider this case sympathetically.!.!..  I beg you.....!....',
       'Lovely story line... love story that keeps you coming back everyday.... at times we are urged to buy energies.. however the energy provided gives sufficient dosage of the story each day... sad that it\'s going to get to the end...  And i wish I could go back and re read certain moments which is not possible.... apart from it.. this is amazing...',
       'It\'s exactly what I was hoping for. The 300 energy per day is just enough for me, since I don\'t like getting sucked into the story for too long. The controls are simple, and I like the game exactly as it is. My only issue is that the dialogue takes a long time to load sometimes. I wish the game would just pre-download one chapter at a time.',
       'I think there are lots of chapters and the energy for really slow. So I am practically making a tortoise speed progress through the story, when normally I can finish many pages in a book (reading). Someone should do something about pacing up the story. And not to mention secret scenes later on can only be played by purchasing the paid version of the game!' ],

Though one thing I wish you could add is the option to link your data to your Google Play account as well as Facebook.

       'I love this game.  Strategy, adventure, and story (once you get far enough) are all great!  Although it is a little pay to win, and they keep coming out with new medals (attacks) that are infinitely better than your current ones.  This can get discurraging, because your hard work doesn\'t really mean much in the long run.    I played for 6 month when a friend got a single medal that made him more powerful than me on his 1st week playing.',

I love that you all added a lower quality version this way I can play this game.] I like it and all, but when that very large download starts after the tutorial, it stops at 4/6 and restarts, even though my phone has enough room for it, I think. Please fix this, I really want to play it!',
       'I played this game when it first came out. I quit a couple weeks later due to repetitiveness and not being able to continue due to weak medals and a year or two later I come back with tons of jewels. I had over 30000 waiting in the mail. Used them all and got some really good medals but when new medals are released its really hard go earn them due to the slow rate and cost. Buying them is overpriced. Pretty much one draw of 3000 jewels is 30$ for a chance at the new medal. This game is really a pay 2 win game and prices are just too much.',

       'The translator needs fixing,  it\'s ok but could be a lot better,diamonds keep vanishing and there are other issues in game I don\'t like, it seems some legiins have preferential treatment regarding tasks and rewards. Other issues with the chat keyboard freezing or not working properly.' ],

       'Don\'t bother. Two words to describe this game: CASH GRAB.The game has lost its appeal. Servers crash and they refuse to compensate you for their problems. They make changes to certain aspects of gameplay, then claim nothing changed. They remove features of the game, then leave us wondering why. You\'ll never see a change log either with updates. There is only one thing they want. Money.',
       'Lately the game it\'s very slow. Sometimes it\'s freezing for minutes. After restarting with force stop cache  clearance of the game, can do up to five moves than it\'s freezes again.

Hey people try the link I was given  05.12.2017 My app setup it\'s on my quick lunch to do the force stop after every 3-4 game moves. Left the game for 10 min to get going still frozen.

       'I like space games, so I like the idea. Graphics are good in your town, but outside missions are lame because all your ship does is shoot  then its over and you lose troops. The idea of How? And Why? pops in my mind. Just a touch up on that and I would love the game. A little action outside your town besides other  players would be nice...',
       'I enjoyed the original version of Plarium\'s Total Domination on desktop, and have had a similar experience here. It would have been nice, however to have some sort of bonus connected to all the time I\'ve spent cultivating 70 levels and all the elite fixin\'s that I have on my original version\'s acct. But still very clean game with much to do, and the adjustment in build times is a good bit faster.',

     [ 'Played many times and game play is ok and its quick to connect to opponents. But the dice suck!! Not sour grapes but all to often when you are in an unbeatable position the opponent will throw 4 doubles or exactly the right sequence of dice to win. This im sure is to encourage payment of coins. Not the best because of this bit could be.  Its a shame it ruins the fun totally!! Edited as the dice really are pants! Ive played many backgammon games online and they do not re-act like these do. There is definatly an issue that needs to be resolved as they don\'t drop as they should. I am sure the other reviews are accurate regarding the dice',
       'Really?? Its absolutly riggged!!, cant believe people rate it 5 stars... first you win, they ask u to rate it and them you lose with impossible dice combinations... dont waste your time and money with this app.',
       'I\'ve been playing this on my computer & 2 other cell phone for months. Since Xmas update I have installed & uninstalled from my cell 35x & the screen locks every time at 94% & won\'t play. PLEASE FIX!  Game was the best I\'ve found & I really enjoyed playing it.  Almost Impossible to use skills against unbelievable - impossible rolls & Dbls. Some players know how to hack game.  I Played in clubs professionally 38 yrs.  When I\'m winning other players roll 6-7 dbls in a row & win with impossible odds at the end of the game. 14 dbls in 1 game - NOT in real life. Never in life rolled 10 dbls in 1 game.',
       'The game is rigged and they steal 25% of all your winnings... They\'re after your credit card like starved vampires after fresh blood! AVOID IT',
       'Game play OK but spoilt by too many "lucky rolls" which cannot be random. Too often only possible roll to change game is thrown.',
       'Ive had Backgammon Live and Playgem. This game seems a little better. Seems to help other players. Don\'t tell me the luck of the rolls!!!!' ],

It is both good for Iphone and androisld users. The only thing bad about it was that your profile picture takes super long to load, so I gave up on that.',
       'Very fun.  I wish I could just do the Party games though.  They are much more fun as I prefer competing with a number of people, not just one.  Too hard to get enough tickets, though!  I get discouraged when no tickets/videos are available.',
       'Forced closed every five minutes in the middle of a game. Slowed my phone down. And made it extremely laggy and hot. Said I would put a bad review if it didn\'t stop. Here you go!',
       'I hate it, I thought it would be a perfect game for a music lover like me but it\'s not. The game just keep loading and loading ( both practice and Normal mod), i wastes 30 minutes for nothing, hope you guys could fix it as soon as possible. Tks.',
       'I\'m a music lover and it\'s nice discovering genres I\'m not into. It\'s very challenging knowing there are songs that I dont know and you have to really listen to its lyrics and the voice of the artist. So much fun.',

     [ 'Worst performing app on ANY of my devices. Playing as a newly created acct lags more than than my lvl530 no idea why. Thousands of pop up messages ruin gameplay. Performance is the worst is all i can say. Not strictly pay to win but almost still fun while free and has been for years. I just hope it works decently on your device as performance has just gotten worse over the years on my dozens of devices. They stopped caring about the game and set their sights on money instead kinda sad',
       'The game since I have played the game is great no problem but now it doesn\'t let me log in it says so.ething about illegal start coin can you help? 3 almost 4 years of hard work leveling up',
       'I didn\'t receive anything for purchase, only confirmation email from play store thanking me for purchase',
       'Need to improve,for offline play for ppl who don\'t have much time or limited internet.',
       'It keeps me interested and on my toes. Great time passer. I enjoy this game totally and hope it gets better and beyond.',
       'Not up to todays standard in gaming (not even mobile gaming!) 100 % pay to win! Story mode, team-fights and some PvP (incl. empire wars), offer less than competitors do. Ocassional appearing events will bore you, latest when played for the third time! Graphics are average. Summing up: The game modes & stages are not attractive, fair or interesting! Tier 2 classes didnt bring more flexebility, instead further inbalanced wars. Since high ranked PvPs are rewarded per season, top boss-fighters should receive similar. One could see over all those gaming issues and still have fun with this game, BUT the aggressively hostile community & chat atmosphere gives this product the rest! A childish product that attracts childish minds! Be sure to protect minors from that inacceptable environment!!! All ranking calculations seem quite strange, as late entries always have unfair advantages. I dont get in what reality people live that introduce earnings and progression upon PvP-losses?!? - everybody knows that the high ranks are earned through purchases anyway, trying to be everybodies darling now? Maybe you should remove pre-selected PvP-lists, and stop rigging the competition instead! No game anywhere in the world rewards for loosing, nobody can take such actions serious, and therefore I still can only evaluate mobile gaming much childisher than real competetive console- & PC-gaming! My advice: You are better off with a competitors game! PS: spare me those ignorant standard review replies, this game is of such low quality, you dont need to outline this further by giving awkward suggestion replying to reviews! All regarding this negative ranking is all detailed, outlined and explained in this review, maybe read it before annoying me with an additional review reply!!' ],

     [ 'I found the game to be quite fun; the storylines were great and the characters were easy to fall in love with. The only problem that I have with the game is the lack of representation. When I played my first game "Prince with Benefits", there were choices of clothes, how to wear your hair, etc. But when it got to the skin tones, you could only pick four shades; and it was just a darker white. That made me extremely sad because I thought the game was really fun, but I couldn\'t really get into it because the character wasn\'t like me. If you could add more shades in your game, it would be a lot more enjoyable. Thank you :)',

Jumps to high expense too quickly. Consider changing that. Some of us are seniors on disability social security and really can\'t afford to have to buy more moves early and then the cost escalates after two turns. I really love this game, but have to keep trying same level because can\'t keep buying more gold.',

I could have given 5 star but i felt cheated and there are only limited heroes. It\'s hard enough to earn stones, coins etc on games so earning a reward is kind of a big deal. And if the game is worth it I spend money on it.',

     [ 'Now these days, to be powerful is cards. And it\'s really sad to see it in one of my favorite fighting game. I have a galaxy s8 plus and when I put the controls on large, it feels like there on medium. If your playing duel and your opponent has 5 power points ahead of you, just call it a lost. Do better. Battlefront 2 is about to be banned in Germany because of the card system. I hope you look into it.  Edited: it\'s still the same. It feels like a pay to win. I\'m going back to shadow fight 2. You know. The good one.',
       'The game is a lot of fun but there\'s one big problem the only way to advance in the story mode is by leveling up and getting better armor but the only way to level up is in story mode so your other option is spend real money on better equipment. So it\'s kinda just a money grab. If that was fixed I\'d give it 10 stars',
       'I really like playing the game. It has great animations smooth gameplay and isn\'t too easy or hard. The one thing I dont like is you can\'t sell your old equipment or skills. If there was a shop to sell them or add runes to them or be able to combine them to make either new or more powerful ones of the sane type I would give this game 5 stars.hopefully the Devs will take this and add this feature in a update. Speaking of updates, I just installed the latest one it was like 403MB but nothing changed! What was the update for then?',
       'Hey NEKKI i have the best suggestion ever. WHY DON\'T YOU add a grab button separately or at least give the option. Also make the side quest more satisfying. Just giving me commons just isn\'t going to work. Please nerf the herlad faction. 1 its crit chance is to stupidly high 17 percent is to much. Its also so quick and has long range',
       'The game has great potential.   One thing I hated are that the attacks have changed significantly... so much that I\'m having trouble controlling my character.  Another thing is that it requires network connection for starting the game. Many of my friends are hating it.  Other than these two, everything else is awesome.',
       'We all know about p2w in multiplayer but this game exceeds above all of them a p2w game in single player campaign!!! Wow!!! Nekki is leading mobile gaming in the age of Darkness.

       'Out of the blue... a random msg appeared on my phone. "I have a question. Do you want to come back to the clan?" What followed was a quick download of a game I had never heard of and after a very short crash course (1-100) I was joining my friends from days of old and blasting through monsters like they were made of cardboard. I agree with their F2P setup and after playing for the last 7 days (having some real fun) I have bought some packs in game to show my support (and for VIP) of this solid offering and hope that support stays as hot as it has been so far.  ElderWook (FMT) signing off.',
       'It\'s a pretty fun game, better than I thought it would be. There is one problem, you don\'t really need to buy "Flooz", but if you do. The prices are a little outrageous. Like 5$ for 100 Flooz, seems a little money hungry. And 100 Flooz for 15 days is 29$ is outrageous as well. I\'ve played other games with better things to do besides upgrading and usually 100 "diamonds" of anything would last 30 and would cost 10-15$. Seems like you\'re trying to rip people off. Besides the money hungry creators, good game to kill time.',
       'It has bugs. Like how sometimes skills don\'t activate right away, and on rare occasions, not at all. The currencies are pretty fair; I don\'t feel like have to buy anything (sucks for the devs, but it\'s not like I can buy anything even if I wanted to). Events keep the game fresh, and I always feel like I have something to do at all times, so it does a good job of keeping me occupied for 20-30 minutes at a time.',

     [ 'The game is good, but the multiplayer needs to be fixed.  It hangs on load and results in the player losing money or gems with no recourse.  It randomly drops ships, and when one player immediatlely gets the best ship and the other player doesn\'t receive any ship until 10 rounds later, it is impossible to catch up.  Fix the multiplayer, then you get your 5 stars.',
       'I was trying to take advantage of the first time deal. I purchased a deal and for some reason Google play didn\'t allow me to  complete the charge. The next day I look in my bank account and I have been charged for what Google play said I couldn\'t do and I was charged another $4 when I didn\'t even click on anything. I want my money back. That is real shady that you would charge someone for a service that didn\'t even go through. And where did a $4 charge come from. And there is no way to ask through support to get that back so I\'m taking this here where others can see. Don\'t spend money here or there will be random charged in your bank account.  Update: I do not want a thank you, i want my money back. There\'s no way to contact the developers except through Google play which already seems shady.',
       'Definitely not worth it. Was fun at first, but after the updated quests, the game took a serious nosedive in quality. Now you HAVE to beat the opponent in order to get anything, otherwise you\'re out 1000 gold. Before, you would get something just for playing. The new PvP just sucks.',
       'Pretty decent game, shame you need to pay gems for the second last ship. The PvP is fun but half the time reduces my gold when I win. Cannot see the devs replying to any messages so unsure if they care',
       'Th game is fun and addicting. Way to many ads!!! Ahhhh My gold counter doesnt always register after endless mode is over. Gives me dble gold if i watch ad but doesnt register after endless battle sometimes. Would gave better review but that sux when it happens. Fix!!!!',
       'its frustrating on the pvp. you get disconnected and automatically lose. and sometimes they put you against someone who has better ships and level. they need to make it even and offer each player the same ships and same power ups at the same time. sometimes I get no power ups until round 3 and my opponent is already on level 7 because he gets better ships and power ups.' ],

     [ 'Love the game.  Hidden objects are challenging and the story line is interesting enough.  I like that game play is tied to building up your island.  It makes for a more interesting and multifaceted experience.  Love the new storage ship.  Think that being penalized to use it stinks.  I can see a penalty for selling objects, but stored objects can still be used, so shouldn\'t lose their value to be in storage.',
       'Have been playing for a long while now and loving it. But a bit discouraged now. Spent a month basically trying to complete a collection. Was short one. You can\'t purchase with coins. It was a reward box for completing a scene. Could never get it and I play long and faithfully every day. You can buy the boxes but thought my faithful play would pay off. Not! No time left to finish yet another scene so I lose getting the grand prize. Just a heads up to others so not to get disappointed.  Putting that aside, I love the game.',
       'Beautiful & fun. The scenes are detailed and look amazing. The decorate your island feature is surprisingly enjoyable as well. They just added a new feature to store items, so you can use them later and avoid clutter as you expand. I only wish compasses were a little more plentiful so I could expand closer to when I hit the star requirement, but that is a tiny thing in comparison to how much I enjoy the game as a whole.',
       'Love the game. Like the new storage feature, except for the fact of loosing flowers. I should be able to keep them once I earned them. The storage feature should be to place items bought that you don\'t have room for or for redecorating. Just buying a bunch of items to get flowers make island look too cluttered.',
       'I really like this game. The only real complaint I have is that you can\'t flip the items you buy for the island so they are facing a different direction. You can move them around, just not flip/turn them around. This can make it hard when you are trying to some kind of fence or bushes to surround a certain area.',
       'Downgraded because I did not get my carriage or my factory. All was well until the Valentines event My 5 star wins do not send their two items. I bought everything to get the chocolate factory. The other items are frivolous, please send the Chocolate Factory.  Otherwise it is the best hidden object game , it is cleaver and causes me to think because they also play on words.' ],
    recentChanges: 
     [ 'NEW STORAGE FEATURE - The cargo ship has sailed in! Now you can store items there to redecorate your island faster. Prepare your island now for upcoming spring seasonal sets.',

     [ 'If you\'ve liked the first game you\'re probably gonna enjoy this one. It\'s more dynamic and there are plenty more content. Unfortunately it\'s built around microtransactions so if you\'re feeling like expending some money things might get easier. I just don\'t understand how they  screwed the controls this much, it\'s likely you\'re going to try placing a plant more than three times before making it.',
       'Great game. Lots of fun. For those who aren\'t aware: Some levels are super hard to beat BECAUSE THEY REQUIRE UPGRADED PLANTS. Level up gives you something to do in the game expanding its lifespan. Level up is not that easy. Don\'t expect to end all levels Ancient Egypt with level 2 plants; level 3 or 4 are fine!',
       'Free to play games are always the same formula: Starts off addictive, gets more challenging, starts encouraging you to buy gem equivalent, forces you to buy gem equivalent. At least most other games are fair with it though, giving you a chance. PVZ 2 does not. Levels go quickly from fun to I\'m done, and become impossible. I\'d love to see developers or game testers try to complete later levels without gems, especially Big Wave Beach. It\'s a shame, as the first game remains a classic. Buy the first game and Garden Warfare if you like it. Leaf this game alone, it\'s a sprout at best. Oh and remember, if zombies try to break into your house, throw your money at them.',
       'I was unable to launch the game for some stupid reason.....i sent several messages to the developers email seeking help,but everytime i get a same reply,asking me to visit the ea gaamjng website. It doesnt work,and seems like the message the developer replied is auto generated. Does popcap/ea rlly take time to fix it? Pls help me,i dont wanna miss out on speacial events. Thanks',
       'I like this game so much, but after the last update the game is a bit laggy, and I noticed that only the normal level music plays every time no matter what type of level I am playing. For example: the ultimate battle theme and the minigame music are all missing. I am playing on Galaxy A5 2017.',
       'EA doesn\'t care about the problems of the gamers. Im not interested anymore in this game after my profile has gone. 3-4 years of playing and buying stuff and most of my plants are in level 10 plus 4k+ gems, but with one stupid glitch, all of my achievements are lost. the game does not deserve even 1 star. I DONT LIKE TO PLAY FROM SCRATCH AGAIN & AGAIN. STUPID!!! u dont care about our feelings, all u want is money..' ],

However,  if I could make any recommendations,  I would ask the developers to put in a realm chat instead of a global one. I would also make the private messages shorter instead of long chains. Maybe a feedback option in the  menu.',

Having to building 20 resource buildings and individually upgrade them is a royal pain and also very stupid with the timeframe it takes to upgrade each. My device wouls literally be pinging all day.  The icing on the cake was them begging for a 5 star rating by offering reward to do so.',

Chief of resurgence got it back then on the 20th OTM gave it back to the scammer! That me me furious. Otherwise the game is great.',
       'If you are into getting better equipment all the time, then this can get boring quick... I was loving it at first but getting better equipment is based SOLEY on npc merchants and quests... Theres fishing and cooking, but you cannot make gear.. No magic item drops... The equipment system in this is very linear..',
       'I only just started, and the games itself is wicked cool, but even after the tutorial, I just can\'t figure out how to use the player chat. It sort of glitches out and won\'t let my type anything. Is this a game problem, or a mistake on my part?',
       'I usually don\'t do reviews, but this game definently deserves it! Easy to pick up and get sucked into. Good amount of classes to choose from and customization is very refined. And finally, an mmorpg that doesn\'t contain a bunch of anime freak characters and outrageous weapons and armor. Such an enjoyable game.',
       'The game is great but i have one major issue with the game, the CONSTANT buff management is beyond annoying. Buffs only lasting two minutes and consttantly having tk recast in my opinion makes the game just that much less fun. Also buffs,taking for ever cast is another very annoying mechanics. In this day buffs shiiuld be instant cast and at minimal last ten minutes. I\'m still playing the game but really wish OTG would address these little announces' ],

     [ 'Seems decent and fair at first but disappointment everywhere if you are a spender. 1.communication within the game is aweful. 2.troop losses during battles are a way high even if your research is good and commander is stout and healthy. 3.packs at 19.99 and under is where it\'s at. 49.99 and 99.99 NO.!. Why you ask? Because number 1 and 2 above will waste your overpriced purchase quickly. 3. The Global Chat has a news feed where you won\'t see any good news about yourself or your faction. Only the bad news. 4. You might place in the top ten of an event and you will receive a msg but again in the news bulletin about the event, won\'t see your name.',

     [ 'My absolute favorite of all of the Is it Love games. Colin is an amazing character with an equally amazing backstory, and the way he connects with the MC is just incredible. The twists and turns in each chapter leave me craving more of the story. The energy they give you is somewhat lacking, but I\'m used to it by now. Highly reccomend!',
       'Really don\'t like how the guy treats the girl, what a scumbag! Plus I\'ve been playing for over a week and the plot is unbelievably slow, the energy doesn\'t last long enough. There are much better otome style games out there.',
       'OK, so I absolutely agree with everyone that the energy you get for free is nowhere near enough & packages are too expensive for what you get. I know, I\'ve bought many. This story particular started bad, but now that I\'m at the end, I\'m hooked. Please continue to update. I have lots of bought energy going to waste!!',
       'Well the energy situation is beyond annoying. You only get very little for free and the prices for the energy and just WAY too expensive. I do like the story a lot though and will probably take 8 years to complete the story so I don\'t have to pay 50 bucks',
       'I don\'t really like the concept of earning energy every 24 hours. But I\'ve got to say every time i see that message when my energy runs out. It leaves me on a cliffhanger and it keeps me in the story. Even if the energy wasn\'t there i would still play the game to my hearts content! Overall AMAZING story and characters!!',
       'Decent game but I refuse to pay the amount of money they want once the energy for the day is gone. The wording is often wrong for the story and the plot could be better. Big issue for me was how overpriced and poorly written this game was.' ],

     [ 'Its ok. But can\'t get past level 530. Got my stats up to the 13 millions and still can\'t get past 500 with ease. Its like the more I level up the more it auto balances to my new stats. Getting tiring. Says it goes to 1000 but I\'m not seeing that anytime soon. Been working toward level 600 for weeks now.',
       'I haven\'t liked many idle clickers, but I love this one. The difference between the rings for the clicking portion and the variety of heroes for the idle portion is much more interesting and engaging than the genre often achieves. The best part is how attentive and invested the developers are--the game only continues to get better.',
       'Fun little progression game. Just one small issue, playing over 2 devices I have to keep reinstalling to get the progress to stay in sync',
       'make the option to connect with facebook so we can play on multiple devices, so far the game is good just installed yesterday and i am on stage 51, love the scene change in the background give the feel of arena, hope there are so many different backgrounds ahead, the only reason i am playing',
       'Addictive. Keep it up with the updates. We need more heroes. And maybe other stuff that you could add too to make it more fun and exciting. The only downside I see for now is the quest timer. 8 hours of waiting is too much for me. Please make it a little more time consumer friendly. Thanks!',

     [ 'Im usually quite picky when it comes to game and this game nailed it. I don\'t have much time for game and this seems to be the perfect game for me to pass time and no need to overly commit. The game play is pretty creative and if you really think through it, there\'s really a lot of depth. Also, the developer is not as greedy as other games, e.g. gems and enchant remain even if you change gear etc. In another games, they could easily force you to spend $ to buy protection. Overall a great game thus far.',
       'I love it especially how I haven\'t played RO for years. It\'s very simple and does not consume a lot of time to play. However it lack of items and varieties of things unless you\'re a cash player. (not much either) EDIT : can the problem where daily quest can\'t be claim be fixed? Usually it\'s the send friend a gift quest where I have to restart the game in order to claim it. Sometimes it\'s the gift box(honor)',
       'Edit: I cant login to game, it force closes at 80%.   Game is good, but never had I played a game that very much lacks game info/help details. Like what the hell are pet skills for? And no details on what those skills do. What the hell is pet polish? What is pet transformation? How are runes used? It totally lacks game guides/info and you have to figure out stuffs on your own. Good game, lacks substance. Im already playing for two months and i still dont know a lot of stuffs. Wow.',
       'The game is pay to win(to tell you the truth). But if you are free 2 play player absolutely it will take time and they put some limitation for free gamer, but actually it is a fun and cute game a good game to try. And actually I already spent money here so I am a VIP user. Good game to invest but its so expensive. Hahaha',
       'Signed up with an XD account I made when starting the game. Loved it day 1, so bought premium, and enjoyed that for ~0.5 days. Second day go to sign in, the password I used that it saves no longer works. I cannot log in and have emailed support multiple times with account info, transaction info, etc, and no response. Practically theft - paid for 90 day VIP and cannot access account and company provides 0 support. 0 stars.',
       'Really good idle game with great graphics and art. Plenty of stuff to do with lots of features and upgrades. While it\'s not required to babysit it all day you can if you choose to do so. Just be prepared to spend gems for extra turns if you get bored. That brings me to my one issue with this game. You are required early on to spend gems to progress your character, although there doesn\'t seem to be a shortage of daily gems I suspect it will get worse late game. In the mean time I give it four stars.' ],

And to only get a few tickets for every 10 Bingo\'s then having to wit for 22hrs....only 4 tickets and hr...and it takes way to long to get to the next level and when do reach it we get very little tickets!!! Dont have to many deals to get both tickets and special prizes... Also how does it when a game starts right after a tournament that I end up in the thousand plus  rank below the bronze??? As much as I love this game think its time to give it a rest until there re more incentives to bring me back!!!',

Thank you   I just played again and I played the whole game but when it\'s time to tally the score the game freezes. I lost 3 footballs and a treasure chest plus my points. Please respond to my issues. I haven\'t heard from anyone yet. But I still like the game. Just want it to stop robbing me....',

On the bonus spin they should add bingo power up\'s of 4. I need more bingo power up\'s. And would like to get power up\'s for daubing every number called each game. I need more power Up\'s. And the game should give you tickets when you get every number that is called correctly on each card every game that you play.',
       'The new additions of the outlaws was great, but then you added all these "special" days that serve no purpose but to make people spend money. I have spent plenty already but not for every game. Sorry guys, bad move. Too greedy.',

     [ 'This used to be my favorite Solmare game, but the pop-up ads have ruined it. They can pop open at anytime, playing loud music and ruining the experience. When they pop up, I usually just end up closing the app, no matter what I was in the middle of because they are so annoying. I will probably end up uninstalling this app because of them.  If this was not an issue, it would be a 5 STAR game.',

       'This game is good and the story was interesting. The reason why i give three stars is because the magic challenges sometimes need to consume lots coins or lunes. And everytime there is new event which need to collect bonbon... It is teally hard to collect it and instead we need to buy... i know this game is free for both pay to play and free to play... but all i see is pay to play since the bonbons need to buy and sometimes events that come back by popular demand also consume lots of money.... I actually liked this game but since you made this game really.... i had to give only 3 stars since the game had to use mk ey A LOT....',

When I have 2 cards and I Bingo on one and Im still playing card 2 why am I not allowed to Bingo on that one as well when that happens ? I have done that a couple of times. But wouldn\'t accept it. Love it now thank you for fixing it !!!!',
       'Good game. Difficult to get Bingo\'s. Bingo reward to low, you really only get the value of the card back. daily bingo chip allowance to low.  Would be better if more free chips were available for those who cannot afford to purchase them such as pensioners. Daub alert should be on all cards for those with vision difficulties. A lot more fun to play when unlimited power ups are active.',
       'I started with Bingo Bash and am now a bingo junkie! I really like the different ways they have made it more fun and challenging. You don\'t have to spend a lot to play and to win. I love it!! I haven\'t had any bad incidences,it has all been good to go...Bingo!!! Been playing BB for a year straight,now. I am definately hooked. The rooms are getting more interesting each  year! This isn\'t your Gramma\'s Bingo anymore. Enjoy, I sure do.',
       'So much fun and very addicting. Number one bingo game so far, only thing is there needs to be an option to take the auto daub off; sometimes like to go back and fourth between cards and keep track of the other numbers and select myself numbers that are called and are on my cards. It makes it challenging and I like a challenge especially the more cards you select to play at once. Also if there is an option to buy more cards great, but if not there should be an option/selection to buy more than 4. Other than those two things the game is way awesome!',
       'I would really like this game more if u took the rocket out, or have it as an option. I dislike that part immensely b 1/6 update. Getting bored with it. Obviously with bingo u have no control over numbers called. But so far and few do u get a bingo',
       'This game is cool, need to fix the near last calls of numbers to be able to press it for a bingo, doesn\'t give you a chance, game over. It\'s ridiculously hard to get buy cards and most duds. aside from that I like it, double up is cool. Need more game to continue to level up. Been playing awhile and I still enjoy bingo bash' ],

     [ 'EDIT: My main complaint was the constant downloading, but I just discovered that you can do a Batch Download through the settings! I recommend doing it after you are done rerolling (4000+ files), but it makes the game SO MUCH BETTER!   My other issue is a personal preference: I wish I could play this in portrait mode. Landscape only makes it somewhat less than a mobile game IMO.   That being said, the game itself is AMAZING.',
       'Good game. Lots of characters to choose from and they are obtainable for FREE. Which is different from FFBE. The only problem im having is its hard to get specific character weapons for each character in story. Specifically the 25 gear draw. I\'ve been obtaining only 3-4 of the 25 story character weapons and I still don\'t have the weapon I\'m looking for. Also it\'ll be hard to obtain the same copy of the weapon to limit break it. And it Cost a lot of gems just to obtain one. The Color stones that are locked, can\'t be unlocked using gems anymore. Didn\'t see it in update, please fix.',
       'Best mobile final fantasy game out there. You get all characters without money. The only thing you pay for is gems for weapons and armour. Haven\'t paid a cent yet and can complete the hardest content to date.',
       'Great game to pass the time. Love the nastoligia. I hope more variety of monsters come soon. Bat,goblin,bomb,wolf repeat....haha. there are more but still pretty lacking given how many are in game. I like the progression system a lot and easy to farm gems.',
       'Great Final Fantasy game. Though the combat is a bit more simplified than a typical FF (since it tries to emulate Dissidia\'s Bravery system in a turn based setting) it still requires thought in your actions and deciding when to hit HP or not. In terms of content, the story is an interesting take on Dissidia\'s lore and it seems to focus more on the mundane interactions between the diverse array of characters.  Story chapters are still being released (looked up what to expect from the current Japanese version and we still have a ways to go) thus introducing more and more characters. Overall it\'s a fun take on the FF franchise that brings together many of the characters that remind fans why we got into it in the first place. My only gripe is that chapters 8 and 9 can\'t get here soon enough (2 characters i am particularly looking forward to)',
       'I\'m so sad I missed out on getting Squall! Must have been an event-only thing. Oh well, I managed to get Setzer and Vanille, so that\'s something. Game is great, can\'t wait for the rest of the story. Also will any other characters from other Dissidias be in this? I\'d love to have me a Lightning or Tidus.' ],

     [ 'This game is perfect for anyone who loves magic, fantasy, collecting, and a whole new level of adorable! Dragonvale takes everything to the next level! I highly recommend it, as it is a amazing game, my most played, and I hope everyone else enjoys it just as much as I do. Five stars! 🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟 Edit 2: I was re-organizing my islands by Element the other day, and I had just finished the Plant Island. I put down a Oversized Oak Tree, and immediately, a image flashed through my mind: a young girl, sitting on a branch of the oak tree, a book in one hand, a baby Plant dragon sitting next to her. Stretched out in front of them was my Plant Island, the dragons freely soaring, the other islands in the distance. And that sparked a inspiration in my head. I just wanted to ask; can I write a Dragonvale book, which takes place at my park? Please let me know !  :)',

Now I don\'t have any roses and 25,000,000 extra coins i don\'t need. Please help. This is a very frustrating bug.',
       'I really love collecting all of the dragons and the fact that you can theme/decorate your park too. But the amount of types of decorations are unbalanced, the majority that you can currently buy in the market are just plant and earth type while there are very few decorations of the other types (such as air, cold, etc).',
       'When I first had it it was super fun. Then I saw a game I wanted so I deleted it I did that before and got it back I could log into facebook and go to my old island. But this time I could not. I was so far and looking forward to seeimg my dragons but it did not let me go to my old island. It left me im tears that I had to do what I did all over again. So I deleted this stupid game and gave this. If I could rate 0 I would',

       'Great game. Bt slight problem I am having. I cant hear commentary, tried everything uninstall n reinstall bt still same. Can someone help?',
       'This game always find a way to make me annoyed! I just relegated because I keep losing and drawing matches! It\'s impossible to win against team with higher OTR and when I play against teams with lower OTR, lose or draw the matches! My players are slow make wrong passes, miss clear scoring chances, won\'t release the ball for a runner, but dribble aimlessly and lose the or make the pass when the runner has strayed offside or has been closed down. Instead of passing to a player in scoring position in d box, it will pass it out of the box to one not even in scoring position! My players get bullied of the ball. When they make certain tackle is a foul, a they get booked, but when com makes the same tackle not a foul! This game has ju gone from bad to worst! And for the record, I have an OTR of 889. With 6 and 7 star players. I can\'t win against  OTR of 835, 845,887, 867, 888, let alone 898, 912.! I have tried all tactical changes possible, still the same out! Lose or draw! Com low rating players will be bullying my high rating players! I have had enough of the game, so I\'m deleting it for another! Thank you for your not so wonderful service!',
       'Nice game. But update is too soon. Always update. When this game is update, need to re-download from the beginning. This is not good.  So, need to update new division. Like World Class & Galactic.  Because there\'s only up to Superstar Division 20.' ],

Even if you hate tower defenses or suck at them you\'ll love this game, the only flaw is being paid and i guess having to use a mobile control scheme, but those aren\'t fixable and are ubiquitous so this game is perfection.',

     [ 'Not the typical build type strategy game. The no wait time for building is great, I have not felt over pressured to buy anything (tho it\'s there :)).  I love the fact that I can control each individual unit to go/ attack what I want.  Reminds me alot of command and conquer from back in the day.  The voice acting and story are very modern and well done. Seems fairly well balanced and overall I have liked this game way  better any of the others in this genre. (I have tried them all guaranteed) dismiss some of those 1* cry baby reviews and give this one a shot it really is worth it. P.s. in all honesty the cash shop in this game seems pretty fairly priced for what you actually get in the bundles too.',
       'This game sucks...I played for a year and now they took back my troop strength.    Nobody can attack anybody.    This is the worst attack game ever.  Every change just keeps making it worse.  Don\'t play this game.',
       'Game is perfect, there is no time build, just if u have money u r on killing spree... but, money for upgrading building is to high, that is little bit issue.. Put those prices lover and thats it! I love this game its fun and additctive! Cheers! 🍻',
       'Since the last update the game play has went to shit, getting really irritated with the the whole thing, game freezing up, just seems when you upgrade equipment it should get better not slower, nor should it take away equipment  was fun in the beginning, but not so much now uuuggggghhh!!!!',
       'I can promise you\'ll be waisting your time with this game unless you want to spend alot of money. Please take my word for it If that\'s the case then you might like it. I\'m very high in medals, but I\'m deleting it they\'ve made it way to hard and you can\'t keep up without spending alot of money. It also takes forever to load it freezes up 60% of the time One of the worst games I\'ve played. With each update they they change it so much it\'s like starting a new game each time. AWFUL!!',

What I mean is you know when your finger is not sync with character movement (uhh how do I explain this). Sorry my english is terrible. Idk if you get what Im trying to explain. Like 0.5 second delay when look left look right look up look down. Its very hard to aim at enemy and looting and stuff. All of this happen after the Feb 28 update.',

     [ 'I really want to give an amazing rating. But once you go out of the app, you\'re forever banished to the loading screen. I\'ve downloaded all the data and okayed the first five missions. I close the app and open it back up after a while. And I can never get out of the initial loading screen. It\'s very sad and disappointing to not be able to play this great game. Unfortunately, I have to uninstall because it\'s a literal waste of space in my phone now.',
       'It\'s fun and all but there\'s a bug out. I did all three of the limit break summons and I got Itachi twice. Ok no big. But when I went to the character list that says 2 new characters they weren\'t there. Please fix.',
       'I\'m a die hard blazing fun, so it pains me to give this review. Developers have let trolls take over PvP. Emergency missions are just repeated. Summons are still summons though lol. But seriously the PvP is taking out all the fun out of the game.',
       '*update - if you want any special characters be ready to spend 100$\'s. The summon you use is just a giant cash grab and never gives you the special characters. I wouldn\'t waste the money. * Update  pvp is a joke they predetermine who is likely to win by where they place the Chakra drains and who they allow to go first when attributes are tied. The game is going down hill.',
       'I like the game. All I ask is that you fix this glitch in the game where you complete an objective with the correct colored units and you still don\'t get awarded the pearls you\'re supposed to get for it. I got cheated twice by this glitch and it\'s really irritating to waste my stamina and not get my reward. Please fix this issue please!',
       'It is quite unfair in ninja world clash to play with far more strong teams than you!! Is it possible to match them a bit better ? I am 2 jonin and there comes one that is 10 and i cant even touch him a little more ....silly' ],

     [ 'WOW, great memories came back. Amazing graphics, and story is going good so far. Only thing is the controles, I mean you should have given the original TEKKEN controls with the moves n all. Its now like a small kid can play. Their is no fun n pressure of making the right punch or through as the good old days. If you guys can make a lit like that, then its will more gold in a gold mine. Otherwise is a nice game.  Thank you',
       'Samsung Galaxy S6... Alright, they went and fixed the release bug crashes within a day or two. I finally got to enjoy the game. It\'s pretty decent. I\'m enjoying the whole fighting/build your characters concept. As promised, I\'ve raised my rating. (Probably could give more on the post mission drops) other than that, I love how there isn\'t a limit to how many missions you can do and have to wait for an energy bar to replenish. Great game so far. (Give more on the drops though lol... seriously)',
       'First off, the thought of the game and concept of direction it went in for a mobile game is fair, I\'ll give it that. But... I will say, being one of the best franchises ever created, I expected more. Not another knockoff style of Marvel and DC\'s (and MK\'s) style of fighting game. I expected originality from an original creator. The having to heal and near impossibility of play at a certain point (unless you pay a lot...) steered me away from it, tbh.',
       'As expected, it looks and performs amazing. Fighting mechanics and modes are pretty innovative and thrilling. It is quite stupid to compare the console version with mobile one. Each one has its own unique style, so they should NOT look the same, cz\' each one provides the fans with a different gaming experience. This surely increases the already huge number of fans of Tekken. 5 🌟 game',
       'Love that tekken is on the phone I was a master at it when I was younger no one could beat me with my combos and counters. The game play is good but having to heal at every opportunity is not. The fight should be about the fight not having to heal before going into the fight. If I could go into every fight with full health I would probably spend money on upgrades and fighters . It\'s good but not brilliant as tekken should be. It yous would like to hear what I have to say message me back because I love and loved tekken on the PS and Xbox one of my top 3. Games off all times. Keep up the good work but yous are not just there yet for me to spend money on it but overall it\'s good but not brilliant as it should be',
       'I just download this game today and every time i open it  in 10 to 15 sec game just close automatically. I haven\'t even do the tutorial yet this game just dont even open i love Tekken 7 i play every time in ps4 but i hate android Tekken cant even open. I will hope they fix this game.i have seen the gameplay on youtube i will give this game 5 star but only if i can play the game so untill then i will give one star because thia game graphics were cool on video Thnks for the update it works grat now' ],
