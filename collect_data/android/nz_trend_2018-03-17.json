        "The game is good (played like 5 missions so far) but i feel like there should be a jump and crouch feature, even if its just a jump feature. Maybe make some levels where you gotta utilize the jumping, maybe throw in some jet packs during some missions/raids to get to a certain area to either continue the mission and/or find some hidden crates. Also, maybe add some melee weapons too?  Besides that, the game is fun, the graphics are beautiful, the gameplay could improve tho.",
        "Good game but I expected it to be the best.  No loading issues or bugs encountered so far. Game loading takes about 6 seconds so no big deal. If madfinger sees this please add new maps and skins and weapons in SGDZ and enhance the game experience at FB as playing the game at gameroom sucks. I promise I will bring you about 100 new players if you did that.",
        "Its awesome. Running smooth with maxed graphics on s8+ and I had no problems while playing it for 10+ hours.  May be starting area could be expanded along with more multiplayer features and interactions. More unique missions between lvl 11 and 15. Also smaller package (5$) could be added. P.S crashes when collecting contract rewards ...Puzzles sucks. Avoid multiplayer and arena untill is fixed",
        "This game has little bit inspiration from many big games like destiny (duh), titanfall, doom. The game does have similarities to dead trigger. All the random loot is cosmetic, guns are easily obtained through missions. Good performance on my S7, but need internet 24×7 to run, even during campaign.",
        "The graphic is awesome.But the game sometimes crashes when entering the casino full of people. Also, add chat system in co-op modes. It's hard to make people understand the puzzles without a chat. Add jump,crouch. It will make the game more attractive and the things are also needed for a game like this. I love the game. Keep adding new things, just don't turn the game into mostly pay to play game.Thanks.",
        "Giving the review after 24hrs of gameplay. Have to say that it's awesome. Cudos to the creators. Loving the gaming experience. Graphics rendering should be calibrated more. Make sure to do that in next update. Coins and slots are hard to obtain. Many of them don't want  to spend real money so better give some daily tasks to complete and earn coins."

        "I play the official release on the computer a lot (over 400 hours) and this is an amazing job! Shout-out to the team for redesigning the levels to be better suited for the mobile! The gameplay is so simple and we'll suited for a mobile phone game. There are some bugs that I'd like to report.  My first I game I played I won with 6 kills in a solo. Can't wait to get my friends into this amazing port! 5/5 stars",
        "Smooth controls and gameplay. No glitching. Amazing graphics. Running on Samsung Note 8 with the latest updates and no other apps running in the background. Kinda reminds me of Battlefield 3... :)   One thing I don't like is the option to either play as a Guest or sign in using Facebook. Not everyone has a Facebook and it would make me want to play it more if I could sign up using my email account etc. Just my 2 cents. Enjoy!",
        "Wow! Great job on this mobile port. In addition it's also free. Download it! This might be the best mobile game I have ever played, with the best looking graphics. It's absolutely insane that this will run on my phone, but I'm not sure if I can run it on my computer. This is impressive and super fun. The controls are fine, but take some getting used to. If you added Bluetooth controller support, I would buy a controller just to play this. Good job guys  :)",
        "Honestly I've always wanted to play PUBG, and now that it's on mobile it's a dream come true. Only problem I faced playing the game is keeping the items you have in inventory. Ex: Changing a recommended rifle to a pistol, then trying to get ammo for that pistol but auto picks up the rifle instead. With this minor fix, and others, it would improve gameplay big time",
        "The gameplay is so great so far! There are stil a lot of bugs though, like mic doesn't work sometimes, aim and reloaded ui is gone, and I don't know if it's my phone but when I use 8x scope, the frame rate drops; like a lot. Hopefully the game will get fixed, and get optimized for low spec phones on a further update, oh and also a suggestion make the hud mini map a little bit big and also make the map itself hd. Anyway you guys still did a great job and thank you for this! :)",
        "I think this game is really good compared to the Xbox and PC versions of the game. It also adds a few other options for the game that aren't on the PC/Xbox version such as distance from your marker, dotted line to your marker, and it tells you how many poeple are in the plane. The aim assist really helps balance out the phone controls to keep gun fights running smooth and everything works really well. There is the occasional lag spike and stuff but the game works really well for my 2 year old Samsung  tablet.  10 out of 10 would recommend."

It takes way longer and as players we dont have all day to play even if we used boosters and in game cash !",
        "Wonderful game indeed. The only thing is missing is the financing part. Would be really nice to have a banking inductor a stock market where you could trade financial products like other cities bonds or debt. Financing during the game can be a big problem so having a financial hub from where you could trade and borrow would be really useful. Thank you for developing this amazing game.",
        "This game is crazy and awesome at the same time. My population has been awesome. Just 2 months and it was from 0 - 92 000+! The crazy part is when I see a blue hospital sign, the people dont even tell good reasons. ALL THEY DO IS SAY, Sometimes I go to the clinic just to read MAGAZINES! My citizens are so crazy JUST BEACAUSE IN ONE HECTARE, I AM A GOOD MAYOR!",
        "Too much waiting for things to get made and produced. The storage and items for upgrades FAR too difficult to get. 42 items to raise storage by 5 items. And it can take weeks to find all the items. When you go to global storage and find an item that you really need, by the time that you get there, it's already sold! 😠 Also, it takes 3 different items, and you have 3 of one item and 24 of another. Really? Also, it should be that you get needed items more often, randomly rather than at specific times. Other than that, a good game.",
        "Like the competition challenges it holds your attention. the time frames of production are a little long however the markets move products fast. I also like the club wars and the mayors challenges. My dislike is there are not enough thought bubbles in the fact that you only get two the rewards should be more frequently.",
        "The Sims keeps progressive challenges fun and interesting, and the Club Wars make for a very fun multiplayer experience!  The graphic attention to detail is amazing! It's quite relax just to watch the shadows of the skyline stretch as the sun crosses the sky or to see hot air balloons floating around the metropolis.  This game is lots of fun!!"

        "Loving the game so far but if the dev/devs are reading this when you go to refresh the shop it asked if you want to add 100 gems to your item inventory just thought I'd inform you guys keep up the awesome work",
        "Horrible forced tutorial. Your game isn't so complex it needs a 20m tutorial. God I hate games like this. Why won't you just SHUT UP AND LET US PLAY THE GAME. When we go to the arcade there isn't this absurd tutorial telling us every bit of the game. Were not morons! I swear to god, \"Stage 5\" and its still got some girl wearing a ridiculous outfit telling me how to play some easy game that thinks its deeper than it is. I thought this was going to be a modern Afterburner. But nope! Fat chance of that. Afterburner doesn't think were stupid. We sat in the seat and took off from the carrier and shot down planes. You disrespect us with this kind of treatment. It's left a terrible taste and I cannot recommend this to anyone. Your main character is narcissistic and ridiculous and do you guys really get a feeling of manliness being told what to do by a woman wearing that? She might as well fly the plane for you!! She obviously knows how!",
        "Airplane games need to have an option to invert the vertical controls (for expert players who want realism).",
        "Awesome graphics and smooth control's.... I like it alot great time waister",

        "Brilliant game that is very light on storage space.  Please remove the fuel/energy system, No fun waiting longer than the actual gameplay. 1 star was left off because I don't like playing as a Guest."

        "Overall, I love it but it would be helpful if we could get something like a monthly subscription. Maybe like 10-15 characters fragments plus 10-15 gems or something. It would help us be less grindy. It would help with collection and able to get legendary easier plus monthly revenue. I would love that. Compare to MFF which is a lot more hectic, you guys a bit more generous. Just please don't put any paywall characters. Hated that.",
        "Fun game but currency is insanely expensive. I don't mind spending money but this game is ridiculous. So instead of me spending a little I spend nothing. I guess my wallet thanks you. It's also so hard to level people up... They keep introducing new characters I have to level up to keep up with alliance missions. Those are fun but I want to level up my other characters too!",
        "It was a great game until they introduced Deathstroke. Now you either need to have him(I do but it takes the fun away) or have people specifically to counter him. They made him way OP and arnt nerfing him anytime soon. So if your just starting you will want to spend money to counter death stroke.",
        "Agreed that DS needs reworking but not frm one of the best to the weakest. Developers, do you even play your own game?? Wasted my $$ & time invested in him. I don't even have lobo if you think I use the 'lowbo' combination in pvp",
        "Upgrade superman please, he is so weak.. i  have Lvl 52 Superman with Lvl 7 gear but his overall is still lower than Lvl 50 Cyborg, Power Girl or even Jessica Cruz with Lvl 4 gear. He is the weakest energy character even though i invest a lot on him.",
        "Pretty good turn based strategy. Wish should some things were explained a bit better, especially buffs and debuffs. Also feel like progress stalls as the game gets fun... Higher energy caps or lower energy drain per mission would be nice."

        "It was enjoyable before the latest update, and the new features look interesting and will make the game better, but there's now a glitch with actually playing? Whenever I hit the ball, I receive some gems and go the distance that would take me two bounces in a matter of seconds before it resets and I'm back at the start. Thought it may have been just a one-off but it seems consistent. Hoping the developers can fix this soon.",
        "Great to use when you're on a quick break. However, the new update needs some more updates. I like how the ball flies faster... But now it's too fast to try and strategically bounce it @ end of flying. Maybe slow it down then. Also, first hit when I open is fine, all hits after, the screen goes black halfway through flying in the air...",
        "Fun game. I would like to see an update that includes sounds effects, music etc. I would also like to see different characters to choose from and/or customization of the character(s). Overall, good job.(Edit**) Great job on the addition of new content with the last update, however with this latest update the game will glitch. The glitch makes the ball not land and resets the game to the pitching of the ball.",
        "I like the game a lot and have been playing it for around a month. The new  update looks and cool and fun and I like the new features and character and stuff but I can only open the game and hit the ball once or twice before this glitch that starts happening. The glitch is that it will go the distance then reset and I won't get credit for going that for or get any money. Please fix fast and keep up with the updates",
        "I liked the game before. I did pay to remove ads. The game was simple and fun. However the current update has the game broken. The ability to get new characters is a nice addition but the game at higher levels is unplayable. The game keeps resetting because the ball is hit so hard and high it goes out of the playable area even if you hit it \"perfect\" once this issue is fixed I will adjust my review",
        "It was fun up until the last update when the developers I assume said \"hey! If we make the ball move faster, we can squeeze more ads in\". The game itself is very fun, however, once you get onto it, you are practically forced to turn your internet off. Things to improve on: change the ball speed back to normal, and make ads more spanned out."

Id go up to wave 700 by playing all day in short was great game update ruined it better idea would have been made a diff game with all the changes they wanted to make",

Helps with beating boring long train rides. **Cons** After buying premium, ads still auto-start when playing the slots. I bought the premium version to get rid of those!!! Moreover, the energy refills and premium tickets remain as prizes within the slot machine, while you have unlimited access to both 😑 Moreover, you cannot reset your game data.

        "I tried the beta and loved it, with my main hope for a way which you can backup your game so I don't have to worry about losing my progress. The developers came through and enabled CloudSave. I already love everything about this game and the addition of that meant and immediate 5 stars from me. Additional plus points for the cute games and being able to toggle whether you want poop.",
        "I love this game. I loved the first game a lot but was always super sad it didn't have a save function. But this one does! So you can save your progress with no problem. And there's so many areas of the house to fill up with stolen goodies. This game is awesome. 100% recommended!",
        "Really like this game however. It's been taking big amounts of coins off me in the past few days? I've purchased some of the coins etc. I leave the game with 2000+ coins to return to 800 this morning? I had the same thing a few days ago but thought I must've pressed some buttons wrong. But since it happened again, am not impressed with this. I've paid money for coins which are going missing? Shame cause its a fun game.",
        "I was so excited for this game since the first one is so fun. Sadly, this seems like it was made as a cash grab. Merely riding on the success of the last one, but changing a lot of the mechanics. For one, it costs more to bring the cats back, and it's more difficult to obtain coins. Also, forget about kiips unless you're willing to spend money, because they even changed the system of trading coins in for kiips, costing you more coins for each kiip you obtain via buying with coins. So if you're okay with all of that, it still has cute cats, fun little items to collect, and new rooms.",
        "It is cute and likeable. Love the YouTube video on the backstory. The cost sending the Klepto Cats Out is a little steep with the amount you make. Feeding, petting and bathing seems to do nothing. Having arthritic hands playing the games is bit difficult. Also why do you get dust cloud when tapping on something?",
        "I miss being able to send out one cat per room (like you could in original Kleptocats) now you have to pay 100 coins to send more than one out (even if the cat is in a different room). It's also harder to get gems as you can't trade coins for them now and you only get one per day from the 'gem dog'. Hopefully this will improve with future updates as I've seen others complain about these mechanics too."

        "I love the game its really fun, but the overall game progression is a super grind. I'm only on chapter 3 and I spend more time enhancing my mech with fooder, that mind you doesnt scale up with rank. The exp you have to put in goes up but not the exp you get from C to A rank mechs is pretty much the same unless it's an enhanced mech and those are super rare after the daily mission is used up.",
        "Really impressed with the quality. Even some voice acting in it. More pervy than I expected, but makes me laugh sometimes. Only gave 4 stars because it's a gatcha type of microtransaction game, and I will never give a game like that a perfect score.",
        "The last maintenance fixed the lagging issue thx for the great work  I just started playing it but my impression are positive  I think sounds takes a big cut from  game size and only one male char.  Appeared until now, overall i think it will be a big success, thx",
        "Turn base game. The mech from C rank can easily promote to the last S rank within 3 days of grinding. Other thing that I like about this game is the Pixie's episode. I really thought I get the correct answer and they gave me a long cut scene. End up it was wrong. I was surprised. Yup there is fan service",
        "Finally a good mecha-themed turn base rpg game I can actually enjoy. Cute graphics, awesome mecha designs, cringe-worthy fan services (which I am a sucker of), all in one nicely packaged mobile game. Thank you Nexon for presenting us with this gem 😊",
        "Game is over 2GB! But dl doesn't indicate that. Only installing the opening. Way to big for a mobile game. What a waste"

The only thing you could get was a skin that is 10000 dollars. It's is very hard to get any money. The only good thing was the graphics and the audio.",

That's not even hiding at all. Also the health taken down when shooting wrong boject should be 1 and remove auto-shoot. Make it easier to hit props and remove the frigging emoji above the props.  This is more like a running simulator.",

Is there some star trek cloaking device I don't know about, come on fix that bull And ships stats are completely, most battleships at flank speed were able to obtain high 20 to low 30 plus knots.",

        "Great game. When it works right. To many times I'm being killed before ships are visible. I have a 15m range and ships don't appear until I'm right on top of them. This really needs to be fixed.",
        "It's definitely a fun game and worth the download. Though it's early day's and it needs some work, hopefully the developers fix the bugs.   Also i suggest slowing everything down.. The fast pace ships just doesn't feel right.. You should make it more realistic and make ships slower and so forth.",

No complaints... No p2w... and the graphics if you set them to full are just phenomenal!!! Keep it up guys!! But fix the loading issue so we can get back to akademia!!",
        "Great game so far. Not sure if there is a community forum or something somewhere which would be nice. I had a character on some other server and it seemed to be erased when the new server opened? Its fine though, previous character did not have too much progression. Music is not the greatest though, would be good if you could include more classic FF music in the game.   Dailys seem a bit overwhelming. There are so many quests to complete each day to get all the chests.   Other than that im quite enjoying it. If you can't load the game after update clear data and dl again",
        "Support is incredibly slow, they will happily take your money and not let you have access to the items you payed for. Will update this review if they ever actually resolve my issue. It has been 5 days since I submitted a support issue with no useful responses made by them. Update: over 48 hours since last response still not any closer to having my issue resolved",
        "I installed the game. I was enjoying it then suddenly it stoped working giving me an error message of \"license stoped working\". I uninstalled it and will try to install it. I hope this time it won't happen again.   What?? Still having the same error! Please do something about it, since the game is really nice.",
        "I was hooked up playing this game as you can still get stronger without spending. Unfortunately looks like something broke during the update and was stucked in the FF splash screen. Hoping that the devs are on top of this and release an official announcement to players.",
        "Characters repeat the same thing over and over and it gets really irritating. And now the game doesn't even start, i love the final fantasy franchise and you have a really great game, and i like that you have to interact with the game to stay alive and it's not just automatic bullcrap, please keep updating the game."

        "I think it is a great game and great concept. Then in the stories characters would send pictures and videos. Great except you have to pay to see them. Not pay and boom you see stuff permanently, but its a weekly, monthly, or yearly thing like its a PlayStation plus account. There are ways of making money without doing this, its called advertisements. Yea they are annoying but they work. I would rather deal with ads and experience the full game then have the game be free but I have to pay for parts locked behind a pay wall. Aside from that the game is great.",
        "Most stories are good but its Very very very pay to read. With weekly and yearly subscriptions. After reading every story in 1 day, i canceled my free trial and uninstalled. I refuse to pay 3 dollars a week. Or even 50 a year to just sit and wait for them to come up with more material. On top of the subscription cost they ALSO have gems you buy and spend on making the fun choices in the stories. So my advice it to start your free trial, cancel it, read every story in a day. And then uninstall and thank me for not spending money to wait weeks for one more story.",
        "Well the reason I put a zero on the graphics was bc I didn't get to see them.😢 I just wanted to let you know that I want to request a update on the game maybe just like let people see the video chats and not the pictures. It was really hard knowing what it was talking about. Overall I like it!😀",
        "I love these stories because they're  breathe taking, mysterious, juicy, horrifying, gruesome and just amazing. I find clifhanger inspiring because it gives me bazaar ideas for when I want to write a horra story. However, I don't like the idea of paying because when I first downloaded this app I read the first story and while I was reading the story a blurred picture appeared so I was so excited but when I went to click on it, it said I hat to pay which was quite disappointing but other then that I feel like this app was a realy good idea I feel like it was well made well organised and well planned",
        "I understand this would be good entertainment for some, but honestly the set up you have is bad. having to pay multiple time to see a video or anything that is added as an extra is bad enough, having wait time are worse. On top of all of it the stories are lack luster. Please fix it.",
        "I love the app it's amazing. I advise u to download it but pls put ads bc u have to wait 14 mins I mean I'd rather watch ads than wait 14mins it just makes me angry."

Why change something that wasn't broken!! 😡  UPDATE...since the second update the game is back and I LOVE it. Thank you so much for sorting it out. I genuinely love this game!!",

Game constantly crashes, cannot play for longer than a few minutes before it crashes, can't go into any other hospitals because it crashes, can't watch videos because it crashes.....*STILL crashing, even after new update. I'm now getting a message on update screen 'this app may not be optimised for your device' - this app worked perfectly fine before update, why now is the app not optimised??",
        "This is A cute game to play doctor and all.  I just wish earning coins did not take so long, because to add on a clinic or expansion, it takes up all your money.  Also to purchase item for the hospital, the cost of each item goes up after you purchase one item. Like the waiting room chairs starts at 40 coins after a few chairs it is now at 70 coins per chair. Like how unfair is that?  Like is their a limit to how high each item gets?",
        "The problem is the friends system requires you connect via Facebook. For people that don't want to, or don't have Facebook, you're screwed. Please implement a way to add friends inside the game rather than through Facebook harassment.",
        "The game has the potential to be very entertaining however the constant crashes and app failure is very disheartening. Definite work needed to improve these issues, now its saying the app may not be optimized for the device. Why wouldn't it say that before downloading? Try again!",
        "Very laggy, took up alot of space on my phone. Wouldn't let me drag anything from one place to another. Very annoying. Don't reccomend"

        "Hi,  I just started playing this game yesterday, and I am already addicted. I really enjoy the interface and the community. The game is really easy to play and enjoyable too. The only thing I would change would be in the new update with the choice of how much money you want to steal, would it be possible to place the cursor at the maximum capacity right of the bat instead of at like 30%? Personally, I want to get as much money as possible, so I have to swipe the little thingy all the way everytime, and it would be way more convenient for everybody if it was straight at the end, and then people could decide to change the amount if needed.  Thank you for you comprehension,  SimsFireball",
        "I'm in love with it.... played it for a few days now and I kinda haven't stoped stayed up until 2am and I work at 6am so yea... it's like a odd rpg with 3 class attacker, Defender and balance NO there are no classes just areas you add levels into that add exp to your over all level and also there is no level cap so come in join now and be the best hacker you can be and also there are crews",
        "I really like the game... my classmate come to me and tells \"hey i'm a hacker look this 😂\"  after this we start play the game together... I Just wanna a \"Denunce App\" in players desktop for denunce for somethings like abusive nicks or \"The trash talkers\" in system logo.",
        "So far I'm having a great time with this game.  Its great for passing the time or if your looking for a good casual game.  Something I'd recommend would be to add some more features between the levels. A 10 level gap seems a bit empty to have nothing new.",
        "This is an amazing concept. Ive spent all night playing and this game is so addictive, I love it.   The only thing I could suggest for this game is to add a shop where you can buy customisable options for your \"phones\" home screen in the app with the money you earn from hacking other players because it would add an element of user customisation into the game. But overall this is a great app and would definitely recommend!",
        "I played HackEx and vhack xt. This game is by far one of the best hacking simulator games for Android I have played, it's got it's issues sure, but the devs work fairly quick to fix the issues and the player base from what I seen is very friendly."

I shouldnt have to keep swiping over the same thing, when ive already swiped over it.. This game is almost like Township, which i loved, however, that game stopped working on me so finding this game was quite exciting.. Please fix this speed problem..",

Or they purposely screwing with the game to see how long players last. Cant get around the game without it editing. Need water for trees and when your neighbors water them it doesnt take. Do urself a favor and dont bother",

        "Love this game.  Once of the best made games I've ever played, with an amazing concept and exceptionally executed. One thing I think should be changed is the \"infinite resources\" mode. It does not give you infinite resources,  it gives you 100,000 of everything except science.  You can reach 0, and it does not regenerate unless you get structures that do it.  That is the only fix I would make",
        "This is the mobile game that other games wish they could be.  After playing for 5 minutes I said shut up and take my money (to unlock additional features, not pay to win).  Gameplay is simple enough to get going, but deep enough to keep playing.  Interface is well suited to my cellphone.  Art/Graphics are very nice.  If I had to nit-pick, the resource icons could be less similar in some instances, but this is ONLY complaint I could come up with.  If you like resource management, civilization building game play, this is a must play.",
        "There's a very annoying bug - animals often freezes and don't produce resources so I have to put them on certain tiles once again. The game is also laggy when an empire is big enough. The concept is great but there's some work needed 👷🏻\u200d♂️",
        "Absolutely amazing game. The unpaid version is really fun, excellent as a stand alone.  The paid expansion is awesome and very much worth the money. The challenges are fun and diverse, you can spend hours perfecting them.  I also like that this company is not a money grabber. Once you pay for the expansion that is it, no micro-transactions. Great representation of what a game app should be, something I am happy to support.",
        "The game is fun at first but it gets hard i cant win any other planets. I really really wanted to play infinite mode but sadly it needs money to unlock and im poor so i cant pay to get it :( also it sometimes the game freezes when i upgrade something and it the screen hangs. Please please please make infinite mode available free!!!!!!!",
        "I like the game but I don't like that you have to buy the unlimited mode and i don't like that the time is limited. I thought I found a game I would love but then it said the \"end game is here.\""

I REALLY miss the Chinese restaurant when I played that one I loved the doctor panda games and I really miss it.if you could can you PLEASE bring back the Chinese resturant.then I will love your games again😀😀😀",

Watch your hops and make sure you time your landings right. If you miss the landing you can go from holding a large lead to struggling to get up the next hill...I highly recommend this game!",
        "Amazing game!! I have purchased 1 or 2 bikes already, I would even pay to get new bikes, but it is very expensive. Please consider lowering to prices or making better bikes more accessible. Ive been stuck on the same level for 5 weeks. I want to continue playing but im loosing intrest not being able to advance. Maybe you could trade your old bikes in to get something in return for a newer bike. Im sure you will never read this, but you do have something special here! Thanks",
        "Very fun BMX pump game. Seen a few reviews say it's gets impossible after level 3 when it becomes pay to win. I don't agree I've just reached level 8 in a few hours. If you ride bikes off road and understand how to pump you'll love it",
        "Its way to hard to win and and the stats do nothing.  You have to be perfect and even then they fly by.  Still LOVE this game.  Just takes away the fun when you get left in the dust and you play the same lvl a million times hoping maybe one time you will be perfect.",
        "I loved this game for 3 days. Then it got to the point where I couldn't beat a level without upgrading my bike, but I couldn't upgrade my bike without spending real money. So disappointing. Don't waste your time if you don't want to spend real money!",
        "The game is fun up until around the third level. After that it becomes near impossible to win any races without spending actual money to upgrade your bike. Had a lot of fun with it up until that point, but it's definitely not worth spending actual money on. Deleted the game after pay to win clearly became a necessity."

        "This is an extremely fun game. O have a few suggestions on how to fix things on the game. I noticed three things while playing this game. 1. There is not a continue playing option. This can easily be fixed and with all of the great work from Dvloper I think that this is not too far away. 2. I noticed you can uncrouch in the tunnel in the basement even though you are not all the way through. 3. Everything is in a certain place. If one object is in a certain place then if you are familiar with the game enough you will know where the other objects are. To be honest this is not a minor concern but still could be fixed. Other than that I can't stop playing! Thank you so much!!",
        "It's a vary good game so hood i can't believe it's on mobile game! Also the game mechanics are so amazing as well. Then there's series of things you have to do that keeps you in the game for a long time; the theme and music fit the atmosphere, and there's not much of a problem with the game either. \"This game gives me goosebumps!\" (From Dashigames aka Dachi) he loves it as well too. #goodgamemakemore",
        "I love this game, especially when you hide just in time and there's that tense moment wondering if she saw you. I get chills down my spine when I'm hiding and I hear her saying \"I see you\". If I could, I would give this game 100 stars. I would suggest having a mode after you beat Granny to become Granny because I think it would be cool to chase the player around the house. Also, I think the game would benefit from a much bigger house, more drawers and of course, more locks. Love the game, keep up the good work.",
        "It's really really really fun game.  But I think if you guys do some more improvements so it will be much fun.  Here's what I think:  1. I think you should make the house much bigger.  2. You should add more enemies for example:  child o' slenderina,  slenderman and the spiders.  3. You should add an Adventure mode.  Where you need to find some books or something like an emblem like that stuff to make them uncursed like that.  4. Last but not least, you should add more weapons for example:  Pistol,  sword,  injection etc.    If you do that,  it will be super cool and fun.   ThanQ 😃👍",
        "It's definatly one of the better (more fun) horror games on the store, but I feel like there could be some more improvements. Firstly I think that if you've completed hard than there should be an (almost) impossible mode. Also minor details such as different textures and Easter eggs would be good. Last, I think that when you escape there should be an outside section where it's still got puzzles but it's more about the atmosphere. (Maybe that could just be for the \"impossible mode\") but it would make the game a lot more enjoyable. Also maybe a reward for escaping. (For incentive). Thank you and maybe you could take this into consideration :) also new app icon plz",
        "Who doesn't love this game? It's bone chilling and exciting for the whole family (Litterally my whole fam plays this game) it would be cool to have a mode where there was no granny just to explore the house and get a feel for how to escape. Also some weapons to attack granny. Lastly a map of where granny is would be super cool. Good luck!"

Too many adverts, spoils game play.... simply have the 1 advert at the bottom and don't inturupt game play!! ALSO, I couldn't press the back button to get out of the game, even with several pressed. I had to quit out and close the app manually.",

The game itself is a lot of fun. I enjoy it a lot and its great time killer. But NOT getting what I PAID FOR does not make me a happy customer. This issue needs to be addressed and fixed.",

        "I 9/10 love this companies games however this game has Flaws. You will have nothing that hits the bottom and it will say game over. I am not happy with it ! The ads literally make you click on it and then take you to Google Play store to download it which is very annoying. I would not download it not a good one.",
        "Uninstalled after playing for 2 minutes. Reason? 1 minute 30 second was ads, 30 seconds actual gameplay. YOU CANT PUT AN AD EVERY TIME YOU FAIL IN A GAME YOU MIGHT MAKE A MISTAKE A FEW SECONDS IN LIKE THIS! For goodness sakes, be reasonable! I won't download anything from you again, I hate developers like you, you are just milking as much money as you can from people."

My 3yo son loves taking turns with mommy and we absolutely love the bonus games! He laughs and gets excited everytime we win!!! I wish I could give it a million stars!!!! HEY ELLEN MAKE A KIDS LEARNING GAME TOO PLEASE!!!! but seriously this game is relaxing and fun! If you haven't downloaded it yet, DO IT!!!!! ♡♡♡",
        "Love the game. It's fun and interactive but have only hit bonuses and free spins on the first game. Been playing for awhile now and not once did I hit the Wheel of Riches or What's in the box. It's bit deceiving that you have to increase your bet to activate the Wheel of Riches or What's in the Box when it rarely or never hits. At least allow those to hit once every thousand spins or something.",
        "My mom loved you so much. She passed away Dec. 18th. She would've loved this game you have. I play in honor of her memory and well, i love you to. Been a fan since before your johnny carson appearance. Wish i could go to your show and play a game for the fun of it and to meet you. Sincerely, Tim Simpson",
        "Ellen, love the candles that light up to spell your name. Clever. The reels in your games are Hurkey jerkey. Smooth is better. Solo, where is the box in What's in the Box? Where is the reel in wheel to riches? Your pay outs are much better on max bet. Took me a while to get to 100M. Keep up the creative good work.",
        "I keep watching the ads to get extra coins and none of them get awarded. I never get the wheel of riches or multijackpots or what's in the box no matter how high I play. I've played SO MANY times on the #Imatellen one and the heart emoji is as big as it gets but I've never gotten the bonus game. These glitches are ridiculously frustrating. Honestly if they don't get fixed soon I'm just gonna delete and find a different casino app.",
        "This game is so great. I play it in my free time. Not normally a slots can but this one is so much fun. The fact that you start out with 5,000,000 dollars is awesome to me. If only those were real winnings hah !"

        "Addictive!!! The characters have so much PERSONALITY. The graphics are awesome. I like playing with Chumbot Ogie!! . It's like playing with a real person. Alot of FUN! I decided to purchase the game and get rid of the Ads. Well worth it!! This is the best word game out there!! I love watching the characters go into the store to shop and when they come out they have on different costumes. Some are so funny. I just sit watch them come out sometimes. One about every 15 seconds or so. I crack up, HILARIOUS! Better than plain Scrabble. Love, love, love IT! Please, don't change anything and mess it up.",
        "Great fun, very challenging & a sleek new design.  It's different to Scrabble or WWF in a good way. You can quickly see if you've made a word, plus you get extra points for long words. Lots of players, so you never go short of a game, & now there's a quick play mode too.",
        "I am giving one star because I thought this was a game that went at my own pace. I have a busy life so I thought that was perfect. But today I opened the app and 3 of the current games I was playing and in the lead I might add said I lost and the game just ended for no reason🤷\u200d♀️😠😩 I don't understand why. I am so upset about this I dont even want to play anymore😡 It's going to go on my game record and it isn't fair😒😒",
        "The new update, where you get ads that blare at you for 5 sec before you can close them? Not cool.  Update... they are gone!! Thx!!  I have another request - is it possible to keep track of the number of times someone scores a 7 letter bingo, or a best word?  I would love to see those numbers in my dashboard too! Thx.",
        "The items to accessorize seriously needs to be updated, which would only make me spend more. All of the knightly garb is not that interesting for everyone. The hair choices are clearly geared for white people, and more food  needs to be offered (mexican, asian, african, etc) because  I love to change all of the time. Lastly, we should be able to sort and organize our accessories so they are easier to see and select - like a real closet!",
        "This game is great,  especially if you aren't so good at making words because it helps by highlighting and using the stars. The only thing I would change is to make a version where the boards are random. Scatter the bonus tiles around to make it a little more interesting."

        "It is fun to play. The first games I played when I got a computer, were solitaire games. I still like them better than ANY of the other games I've played. I will be adding this one to that group. I like games that make you \"think\" rather than \"time you\" and you have to hurry. They make me too anxious. This game works for me. Thank you.",
        "I wish i knew if all games were solvable.  I like to play winning games and replay the deal until i can figure it out.  As it stands, i cannot tell if it is a winning hand so i move on if i lose more than a few times in a row on a single hand.",
        "There is absolutely nothing new about this game except that you slapped the name \"Crown\" over Tri-peaks and called it a \"new strategy game\". I was really hoping for a solitaire game I hadn't played before. I'm extremely disappointed. I'm a HUGE fan of your regular solitaire game. Huge fan. But the name and description are misleading and it's embarrassing.",
        "I really enjoy the game, EXCEPT for the fact that there seems to be no way to turn off the ad sounds. Even setting my phone to mute won't mute the ads. It's intrusive and annoying, especially in a public place.",
        "You have the best solitaire games by far, I have almost all of them and I love everything about them!   Only one complaint on your solitaire and spider controls-----thev are not stationary (stationery) l.    Thanks. People love you!",
        "Another great Mobilityware game.  My only objection is that they didn't use the same familiar controls from their other cars games.  I don't like these, particularly since I'm used to the originals."

There should be and online multiplayer race mode and the mountains just endless also the rocks on the mountain should have a chance to swap places and stuff like that after a few falls also a easy one add in some funny cool looking skins for the hiker and maybe a tool upgrade system and how to get these is u get rock points which u get a few every time a certain hight is reached",

        "Game is great, but every time you die (and that's really easy to do) you need to watch about 22 seconds of ads. Once i got a 15 second ad, but the skip time stayed constant and i had to watch the entire thing. The game also bugs you constantly about connecting your facebook account. So if you want to be able to play without interruptions constantly, you need to pay and connect to a facebook account.",
        "Brilliant, innovative, addictive game BUT please reduce the number of ads. That's why this game is only averaging  3.5* and why I can only give it 4*. People will stop playing very quickly as it currently is. Just take it down to an ad break every end of run. Also a way to easily view all positions on the leader board would be nice. Otherwise the game itself is great.",
        "I would have bought the ad free Version eventually, but it was so annoying even to get used to the game, that I gave up. If you want more people to buy the game you have to give them the opportunity to play without being interrupted every death. Your game can be the best ever but still no one will play it if they have to invest the same time in watching ads that they invest in playing the game.",
        "Too many ads with a skip button that reduces ad time by 10 seconds. Literally, f off, dude. Can't play your game, I play for a minute and than watch an ad for half of that time. Unfair and boring. You almost don't get to play the game. Which is, btw, awesome",
        "Visually satisfying, nice, fitting soundtrack and pretty innovative. One thing is that it's extremely packed with ads. One every round you play. Maybe dial it down a little?  Also, maybe add tail patterns...",
        "Great game, but way too many ads. Please tone it down to 1/3 times dying or something or people will stop playing"

        "Love the game. Definitly think 8ts rigged on tower of fortune for sure. Az for going through 3 different phones with the app i have actually had luck linking it with my fb never had an issue. It would be alot better if non active clan members could get kicked. Im trying to achieve the legendary chest which is impossible with maybe only 8 active people. Other than that its pretty addicting. I play every morning before work and every night before bed. Plenty of levels to keep busy!",
        "The puzzles are interesting, the animations are generally enjoyable. It quickly becomes a grind, though, where you aren't enjoying the gameplay, you're just trying to get past the timewasters of the daily challenge, or fighting the arbitrary points of the arena. The clan battles and Mighty Eagle challenge are the best parts, but you can't play them all the time. You have to grind away in the Arena.",
        "I just purchased a new phone. And being I'm using the same e-mail address i would have thought it would have started me at the same level I had been on prior to the new phone. Kinda sucks because i had spent a near fortune and was at level 64 ! Unless they can fix this I will remove the game for good. I mean I had every hat except the ones that cost 25,000. Now I'm at zero!",
        "RESUBMITTED: Arena games were sucked up by those high-card players or maybe cheaters. My power cards are the same, just like my opponent, or higher than my opponent's cards. When I slinging those piggies or blocks, it gives me lower points like 4 hundred thousand. But if my opponent slinging them all, it gives higher points like 7.5 million. I lost my winning streaks so I had to play again but it gives me same points so I lost again, sadly. I thought your arena games are really much fun, but they're not.",
        "Classic gameply bogged down by aggravating fremium distration. Havent run into any energy bars yet and already on second world. New birds add interesting gameplay elements but spells are an automatic win that add no semse of achievement besides skipping a hard level. If you want some classic angry birds but dont mind clicking through to get to it then give this a download.",
        "He game starts out with tutorials, but they act like you've never played angry birds before. Theres a world map which is cool, but its not needed and is just boring. The worst part about this game is that you can only lose 5 times a day. I just want to play the game like how the original game played!"

This is the only quality that ruins the game. The app opening randomly to show ads. To the creators; that's not ok. ONLY have the ads appear IN GAME",

The puzzles are very easy but the struggle of trying to initially move the ball is a little annoying. The graphics seem unfinished at some points (such as the level select) and it just overall seems empty and bland.",

It gets really annoying so I unistalled it. I do not sugest you download. I had music playing at it got interupted by a add, mind you that my phone was in sleep mode, and it scared me half to death cause all I heard was a roaring sound come from my phone.",

If u do I would love to download this app again although it did annoy how every time I finished a round I would get an add straight away and that ment I didn't finish very many",
        "It was good but the game glitches and its WAY too easy. I, a 13 year old, finished in 1 and a half days. I thought it would ve harder, but it isn't. Also, only like 40 levels? It makes it easier. Only good if you want a quick, easy game."

        "Hey... I would give this game 5 stars but there is 1 main -VE POINT. FUEL takes TOOOOOOOO LONG TO RECHARGE.  The point of this game is to playyyyyy the game. I don't want to keep waiting. I downloaded your great game TO PLAY it. Please try to solve this issue. I will definitely give you 5 stars if you fix this. Please listen to us and read our comments. Most of us are mentioning this 1 -ve point. Thank you",
        "Great game but seriously?  The feul tho.  It takes 30 minutes to charge and it's only 5 as the limit.  Cmon that's bad!  I love this game and it has great graphics and it's a great time killer but please make the fuel like to 10 or make it 10 minutes to recharge.  If so I'll rate 5 star$",
        "This game deserves to be the best game of the year. Its so simple and yet mesmerizing. It is also very fast so you won't get frustrated and could play this game for hours (or until the fuel runs out :-P). This game is quite exciting and the visuals are also nice. This game deserves more than 5 stars. The music blends in quite well and jobs make it more fun. Their are many sources from which you can get rewards which makes it easy and challenging to play. I love this game. Also you can buy more fuel slots in the shop for 100 diamonds. Its expensive but I don't need it beacuse I have to keep track of the time and only play until the fuel runs out.",
        "Really good idea let down massively by the developers. Progress is extremely slow due to fuel taking so long to recharge and having to use gems to buy new vehicles. So unless you want to spend all your money on a free game, it doesn't really feel like you're getting anywhere.",
        "Not too bad. I would have like to see the car while playing, and the graphics could be a touch better. I would honestly like an option between dragging your finger and using buttons on either side of the screen. That alone would have given this a 5-star rating from me",
        "It shouldn't be easier to level up rather than actually playing game. I wouldn't say that the gameplay is difficult to play, but the purposefully placed trucks that shoot you is a bit ridiculous. Other cars are in the way which ultimately eliminates you before you can attack the shooting trucks. There really is no challenge except trying to beat your previous score. I give this game an eh out eh."

What is a Hexad?  Those letters were not even showing, so how they come out of thin air and then bear what I. Have chosen.  Not fair at all so.changing my 4 stars to 1",
        "This is one of the perfect games I've played,  it is also fun and can pass time very easily because once you start you can't put it down. Also there are not any annoying adverts,  it is also educational for children to learn new words, that's why I've given this game 5 *****. Thanks!!!!",
        "The game is great. I love how much attention went into making this game, it gets a lil boring (for me personally) sometimes.  Had a few glitches, like one time when I made a move, somehow a blue \"sapphire\" and a blocker square became one square.... which sucked, because I couldn't make a match, that I otherwise could have made.   But I really do love this game.... one of my favorites,  love the challenge level, not too easy, yet not too hard either. One day I'll go back though and try for 3 suns on all levels!! Keep up the great work.",
        "Overall a good game lots of levels. Couple of complaints, sometimes impossible to get 2 or 3 stars regardless how well you do. In \"endless mode\" computer usually comes up with words I have never heard of before. Player can never win. If player lost a life but wins a future round why can't we regain a life? Not fun if you know you can never win endless mode.",
        "So cute! I love the sound effects and the story of those little languinis. This is not timed so you are able to put it down/look up to do what you need to do.",

The other thing is u should make it where u only need to eat 2 fish to get full health or at least add a fish catcher so u don't have to stand there and keep catching one fish at a time but other then that I love the game one of the best survival games I have played so far and I have played almost all of them keep the good work up this game will go far",

They're not well-distributed, having reached a point where no ads would show up after a few runs, and then one would appear after every run no matter how short. A 30 second ad after a run that ended in just a couple seconds? Multiple times in a row? I understand ads needs to be there, but I'd like to have more play time than ad time.",
        "Very enjoyable game, quite addictive and jumping back into a new game is quick. Couple of gripes, there seems to be some slow down or framrate dipping after an ad has shown and the option to remove ads isn't working. Sort this out and it will get another 2 stars",
        "The game itself is pretty fun. I think I'd like it. But the ads are far, far too intrusive. Not only are there too many. But, many of them have timers. Some are 30 seconds, and you can't break out. Too annoying. I have no interest I sitting and waiting for ads to finish",
        "Wow!!!! I've never been more annoyed with an app in my life!!! I would play this game all day long but the amount of ads are literally driving me insane! Two runs and another 15 second ad comes up. No thanks",
        "Ads pop up during gameplay where your fingers contact so it stops game play ... other than that it's good but I've had enough. Fk you chilly:-p uninstalling",
        "This game was my favorite of any maybe ever. I played all the time, then there was an update and I had to uninstall. It made the app close constantly (even when it wasn't even open and I was in other apps), there's way too many ads that make me want to vomit, and it stats to lag now when it never did before. Someone at corporate ruined this game. Smh."

        "I liked the game so much. No! I love it, but it's just that I'm now on level 65 but I'm stucked since I only have few gems left and I needed to extend the time, and buy some customers which I find amazing just to save your energy and the stage but I also find it hard since I have already completed 3 stars from lower levels and why is it that I can't play the levels I have already completed? I would really suggest that lower levels would still be played just to be able to collect gems. I hope you can fix this issue though. I'm so loving this game and I'm getting addicted to it. I got stucked on level 65 on my two days of playing. Thank you",
        "Moving on is hard on some levels because they are specifically designed for you to use gems and they are hard to come by. However, If you are patient enough you can eventually earn them. I enjoy that you don't have to drag the items to the customers. It's definitely an enjoyable and challenging game. I'm currently at a \"coming soon\" stage where I can no longer move ahead. I've been waiting a long time and do not want to wait forever. Please do an update soon!!!",
        "I love this game! So few games actually suck me in, but this game had me addicted right away. I play on my phone and laptop. Yes I have two different games at different levels lol. I love how upgrades are so easy and it isn't impossible to upgrade or move on. It gets challenging as you go up levels but it's so fun.",
        "It's fun till you run out of energy. They get you too rate the game right away while you are having fun with free lives. Give you enough lives to rate it good then the lives end and you have to watch a min advert or 30 mins for one life Regen. OR PAY. They just want your money at that point. So sad.",
        "Brilliant little time waster of a game.. yet.. once you start getting to the higher levels.. the less chance of earning gems and i aint noway paying for them.. last time I stupidly paid for gems on cooking fever..and got my account hacked into! Big lesson learnt! I do still play this alot tho so overall, definitely a good game. 👍",
        "Some levels are nearly impossible to beat without help. Also I dislike that if you're about to lose due to food burning or an angry customer that there's no additional warning until it's too late. Then you have to sit there and stare at your warning till your level is lost and over. Other than those 2 things I greatly enjoy playing."

The translation is spotty but works good enough for me.",

        "8 ball i have been playing it for sometime now and I spend alot of money on the specials.. great specials.. but I noticed whenever I buy coins I don't win any games until those coins are over and I'm only winning recently 2 games maximum in a row and normally my win streak used to be 7 and above... I don't know why this is happening but it sucks because it's putting me off the game.. it's like 8 ball is making sure I'm losing hence the rate 3",
        "Great 8 ball pool game. Plays great and looks great. 1 slight issue tho. Im from Ireland but i seem to be playing people from India and surrounding countries.   The Irish and Indian flag are kind of similar so im guessing thats where the issue is coming from.  I cant seem to edit my location either.  Would be great if someone could help but if not, ill be happy to continue playing against random beautiful Indian women 😁",

        "Hey miniclip.. good morning.. i am from india.. i was playing 8 ball pool dubai match. I was just about to win when i hit my solid ball and then last black ball was left but the ball goes in opponents hand said that you didn't hit your ball.. what was that? Can you please stop all these hacks and all for other users. There is no fair gameplay between each other.. please do some favourable to all users.  Hope you will take quick action in this manner Thanks.. Apoorv",
        "The game is very good. But that spin wheel is not fair at all. I've been playing this game for 6 years now (I know there used to be 1 coin reward there) and I've never got anything more than 2500 coin reward. My point is if you are keeping other rewards on that wheel atleast give equal probabilities for each reward. If not, just remove those big rewards and replace them with small ones but atleast with same probability for each of them. Hope you will do something. (P.S. i know it's a lucrative strategy developers play so that players will stick to the game. But you know just trying.✌️)",
        "First of all It's joyful game few notes need to address it:    1_last 3 weeks is suddenly stopped without farther notification.. And I was about to uninstall it..     2_one of the question was you can play with other users offline. This is not correct!...     3_ need to add \"Edit and changing names\"     4_Game rated with 5 star.. Than you all 🎱"

        "Great potential, but there needs to be a way to earn free gems for the abundance of chest I have... Also there needs to be time to clean up the map once The main objective is completed and definently more chalice for chances to complete levels, I only have a certain amount of time to play so I need to fit it into my time, not yours.... Ok game but not a great game for the players, micro-transaction heavy and very little chances to complete the levels.",
        "Really enjoy the game. Relaxing and addicting. However, i dont like the large amounts of lock chests taking up my camp space. I think the lock chests are too much of a push to get me to buy crystals. Chances of getting crystals seem slim and with the small amount of space available for other things, this is a down side for me. If i have to pay to open chests that i have been rewarded, why play? That might be  something that causes me to quit the game before too long.",
        "When I first downloaded this game it was fun...now, all the dragons only have a stamina of 1 and now you need trophies to play levels. These trophies take f-o-r-e-v-e-r to accumulate. These things have made the game drag on way too long. And accomplishing any thing may also cost actual money now. I have read other reviews about the money system of this game and I will not be throwing my money down this drain.",
        "This game is top grossing because they take your money! Then they dont respond to you trying to contact them! This game is a LOT of fun. However My Game Has Been Reset And ALL of my purchases have been deleted and I did not receive my last one. PLEASE HELP",
        "Loved this game at the start. But since last update it has crashed on me several times. Today alone it has crashed on me 3 times. I lost all my camp progress each time and had to start again and of course each time is different because it is impossible to duplicate. Today I also lost my dragon gems and dragons I had created prior to crashes. There fore I lost my money spent. I also lost my daily chest which  contained 2 life trees and a super egg fragment.  I am very upset and dissatisfied now and regret spending money on this game that I loved prior to all the crashes.",
        "Please remove The Challenges. The timer runs out too early on all of the challenges, all the way up to challenge 20. I have all the standard levels finished. I have been waiting for you to make new standard levels. The timer is cheating people in your challenges. There is no way they can be completed. I am not buying 50 gems to add 2 minutes. That's a waste of my money."

        "Make that we can upgrade weapon to become stronger. Add reward when you have 100% in one Chapter. Make skin for weapon. Developers of this game, you must fix the caracteristics of different characters in this game. Literaly all have similar characteristic +1 and +5 etc. And what is the point to collect other characters? For example \"Zero\" character to have +8 bullet pircing and +12 reload, and other characters to have +2, +6, +9, +13, +18... also for weapon is the same thing... make all caracteristics different. You can reword weapon for rank, rank 5 win something, rank 10, 15, 20...",
        "Fun game. Would have hated it higher but when I got to 8th or so level, the levels ran out. Its said more episodes coming soon for several months now. Alot of waiting for developers to develope.",

        "The only issue I have with this game is rex's head. Please make it transparent so we can actually see through it. Otherwise I can't see anything because his head is in the way.",
        "I'm very crazy about the cover fire .... But sometime when I play it with data connectivity the game will automatically turn off and I loss my all progress in that game and finally I had to need it start again ..... Developers plz solve... its really an issue between me and the game fun",
        "This game is actually okay for a mobile app. The downside unfortunately - as with so many - is that there is never quite enough of anything to progress without spending a considerable amount of money. I invested a lot of time on the zombie event only to find that time was running out and I would not be able to complete it without stumping up a relative fortune. I would have bought this game but refuse to pay to play and watch a ton of advertising in the hopes of getting the gold or tickets or cash or whatever. For what you might pay for stuff like this go and buy a console game. Heck you could buy the console as well on what uou could save avoiding this. Deleting it right niw. Adios greedy developers"

        "Very fun game. Multiplayer is awsome! Please add private matches so i can play with friends.   Physics still need work to hold up to real world standard. Rocks dont follow thru on take outs in real life as they do in this game. Also (rules), a rock needs to make it all the way over the hogline in order to stay in play.  Thank you for making this game!",
        "Best curling game I've seen Enjoy the graphics, controls, love the 1 on 1 against international players and career game options. Seems consistent and easy to learn. Needs a few tweaks like... throws that don't make hog line or touch hogline must be taken out of play. Have seen the bug that others reported, sometimes rock after thrown disappears , some kind of glitch that happens occasionally.  Sometimes the sweepers don't react to my movement to sweep. Would love to see 8 stones instead of 6. If you love curling, this should satisfy",
        "Great game and takes a little practice, although I don't get the automatic movement at the end of some throws. Is this the hackers people talk about. Its not always in the oppenents advantage but when it happens, the rock positons don't make sense. Anyone know why this happens. If they fix that I would give it 5 stars",
        "Great game except for hackers. There is a hack that allows some to bump or change finish of a throw. Yoy can go from having 2 scoring to opponent having the score, changing after the rocks stopped. Developers have not replied ti report. Fine for some fun but don't waste your money in upgrades",
        "Good fun. Physics seem good, sometimes my sweepers don't sweep at all but I don't think that makes too much difference. I'd like to play alternate ends rather than winner goes first and the rocks don't spin which would add a bit of something to the graphics. I've yet to play online, just practicing against the CPU.",
        "Physics are not like real curling, rocks are dead in the house when hit, physically impossible doubles and triples, improper use of the free guard zone rules (if a rock is in the house, it is free to be removed...not in this game).  Connecting people across the globe is a cool idea but you frequently lose people and you win without finishing a game.  I've played for 35 years so I speak from experience."

        "Hello. I really like the game, but there are a few bugs. Like in multiplayer in drift races theres a bug where it just stops on the timer part and then someone needs to leave. I wish you do more updates like adding a dodge challenger with wheelie kits amd more garage space",
        "Great ass game, just please make the streets more colourful like the buildings and make the road blacker, about the buildings, add light and contrast to the game, overall it's a great game, also plz add porche 911 turbo, nissan gtr, and so on with supercars. Plz also add suspension tuning, engine tuning ( horsepower or torque ), ECU tuning ( how much petrol and oxygen into more or less rpm ), nitrous tuning ( duration or power ), turbocharger tuning ( more psi or less psi ), add engine overheating as I said with the turbo and engine, if more psi or torque the engine will blow, camera angles I hope you add the inside view, and add aerodynamic tuning after you add rims, wings, bumpers, car height, and all that downforce. Plz make the map bigger and add racing tracks, like the URL, let's say about 5 or 6 tracks, plz. And plz make the tyres have designs and patterns and make them darker please. Story mode too, like in NFS most wanted plz. Also you can't hear the cars tire sounds or drift sounds, please, please, please, I beg you turn the tire volume up because I feel like I'm drifting on oil or something.",

BTW, in the future updates, add the 1999 Mitsubishi Eclipse, Nissan Skyline R32, some muscle cars, more decals and some more upgrades like ECU, Intercooler, Suspension, and Transmission. The only problem is on multiplayer, some races freeze after finishing, fix it. Also add circuit as well!",
        "This game is great. Just need some fixes. like in drag race. The speedometer should be in different position so we can see when to shift up the gears. And make the AI a bit difficult",
        "Controls are very very bad. I cant even turn properly let alone drift. Controls is a big no."

        "I'm addicted to this game especially the daily challenge boards. Pros: pencil feature, all instances of the number Are highlighted when you fill in a cell. Con: the timer starts when board opens, would like it to start after filling in 1st cell. As others have said the ads are right below the numbers, too easy to tap when your on a roll.",
        "Just downloaded this app.  So far a very well executed app with excellent layout and controls/easy and fluid to use.  Much better than other Sodoku b/c no ads during actual game play!  The only \"con\" is that I cant put graphics behind gameboard. Only suggestion: Would like to see options for backgrounds like in Solitaire. This would truely make it a 5 star game!   Ps. I was not paid/reimbursed or otherwise incentivised for this review in any way.",
        "I like this app, but it feels like it could be more educational. I get stuck on the expert puzzles and often have to use the hints, the way the hints just tell you the number in a selected square doesn't help me work out what I'm missing. If the hint could show me how I could reveal another number would be more helpful to me. Otherwise top notch app",
        "It's a pretty decent sudoku implementation, far better than a lot of the other ones out there I should say. The only issues I have are firstly I do find the \"penciled\" numbers to be a little on the small side (on a 5.5\" screen). I'd also say that for those of us that don't find the \"expert\" setting particularly difficult (without meaning to sound arrogant), it would be good to have a step above that. And finally a Google Play leaderboard would be a nice addition. None of these are massive problems, it's a good app as I said.",
        "Great app. I can do Sudoku on the app with the 'write' facility for numerical notes and I like how it removes them automatically as you fill in other areas. But I still find it very difficult to do paper Sudokus because I can't fill in the right answers without loads of workings out on the more challenging puzzles. The app makes this aspect easy.",
        "I would greatly prefer to start by touching a number rather than touching a cell.  I have to hunt for a cell with the number I am working with, touch that to show where all instances of that number are, then touch each cell and the number to place either the number or a note that this might be the number.  If I could select the number first, I would only have to touch each cell to place that number, then turn on \"note mode\" and touch each cell for a note.  Only half the taps per game, saving both time and the muscles in my arthritic hands!"

        "Like the game but would be better if resources would come back after a while, or you didn't loose your inventory when you died. Cant play for longer than two mins without dying again looking for wood. No axe, no pick, no wood.....  get killed. Lol",
        "It was very promising game. New update turns game very very hard and unbalanced. To much equipment cost for too little kill reward. Already spent money. But now without real money it is so difficult. No fighting chance at all. Please fix it",
        "This COULD be a great game, but it's a very much unbalanced. Your resources on you area NEVER grow back, so you must travel... I get why that is, but it takes 10-30 minutes, unless of course you want to use energy. You get 100 energy and it takes too much energy to fast travel at the pace that energy is replenished. If you can get around that, and build a few items, tools, weapons, etc. It seems like the game finally gets going but if you die from the 5-10 attackers, you lose ALL of your stuff on you. Everything I've mentioned can of course be fixed by spending a TON of money, but beware, everything has durabilty, and once broken will disappear. So you will always be spending money. CAN'T THERE BE ONE OF THESE GAMES THAT AREN'T MADE OUT OF COMPLETE GREED?",
        "I really like it, but such a slow start, after the initial offering of goodies i just stumble along with constant death, no weapon, lose my bag every death. Very frustrating.",
        "Great game, wish there was something to gain more energy, and a hp, or energy lvl cap off, max hp should go up like 2hp per lvl gained. Idk more stats that the player can tweak for gameplay",
        "The team solved all my issues. Beautiful game, new twist on an already good concept. Loving it! Can't stop! Addicted!"

To test is on lvl 1 first corner accelerate and turn left (any set of controls tried all) it will start turning right seems to be when the prospective changes. Looks like it would be good if it went where you tell it to. Might be due to latest patch so will try again if it get fixed",
        "Awesome game! Only issue is on season 7. Race with save 8 seconds on perfect drift.... it says 3 laps but one lap doesn't count so you have to do 4 laps and you can never save 8 seconds. When crossing finish line game keeps playing and doesn't finish, time runs out and you've lost. Please fix",
        "Awesome Game... no need to spend money to get best cards you can easily earn them... Can play offline too... There is a glitch though in season 7 - save 8 second stage... even after finishing it wont give 3 stars and fails me.",
        "Good game, really fun. On season 7 the 6th drift game you cant pass it. When you cross the finish line it says wrong way and doesnt let you finish the gane to get the last star. You end up doing 4 laps, even with 20 secnonds still on the clock. Please fix the issue so I can complete the season"

        "Amazing shooter game, awesome hero collecting game, great multiplayer game. Definitely suggest that you at least try it out. But one thing you should look out for, it's pretty easy to sink between 5 and 20 dollars a week into this. Sometimes even 40 to 60. But, it's pretty free-to-play friendly if you can't afford to buy some gold.",
        "I love this game. It's very dynamic and the gameplay is good too. The only problem I have is every single time I do PvP... It pairs me with an opponent far greater than what I can hope to beat. Sure, that's great for improving, but it disheartens me and makes me feel like a horrible player when I can't even beat ONE PvP opponent, ever, while playing the game. I would suggest to the devs that the matching system be a little more flexible when pairing. Give us a matching system that will actually give us lesser prepared players too so we can have the fun of winning, as well. Also, I am disconnected every single time I do PvP battles and bounties. Quite unstable, unfortunately.",
        "I really like the game. It's fun and has enough activities and quests to keep you occupied for a while. My only complaint is how they match people up for the PVP missions. Sometimes you get matched up with people with far higher power and Team level menu which makes it nearly impossible to win. other than that I really enjoy the game",
        "Super fun game. I haven't got bored of the game because there's always events going on which is good. One of the better if not the best shooting game I've played. I think there is a slight glitch when using Steele. Sometimes after I activate his open fire skill he doesn't shoot when I press the shoot button.",
        "Latest update definitely made the game harder. I used to run 4 gauntlet levels with little issue but now I can't get through 1 without losing people. Resurrected characters are completely unwelcome and unfair in pvp when you tell on kills for money. Probably going to uninstall, you're welcome for the money Hothead",
        "Starts off ok but then the pay walls creep in and you are constantly bombarded with prompts to spend money. The PVP is absolutely pointless, highest power rating wins every time without exception so you know if you've won or lost as soon as it picks an opponent. Needs a lot of work before I'd consider dropping any real money on it."

        "Would have given 4 stars if it didn't make you wait 4hrs on the pvp award or at least make the 4 he wait start when you first make the 1-5 match. Not wait 4 hrs after you complete 5-5. Look at how Clash Royale has their setup. Your already  trying to mimic their game. You should study their gameplay more and use it for improvements. Just saying. Make a change in that 4hr wait.",
        "Since the new update, major loading issues. Game just freezes on the title screen. I noticed that a lot of people have complained about the PVP battles not being fair, but they usually within reason. My main complaint is THE HACKERS WHO DRIVE ME TO THE POINT OF A MENTAL BREAKDOWN. This game has great potential, it just needs the major issues addressed.",
        "It's needed bug fixes for HTC One M8 since release. Current event RoboBebe stuck at applying configs. Matches work fine over my work hotel wifi but home wifi must reconnect after every match pvp or solo. 5* is my opinion regardless just 1* to try and catch devs attention",
        "Too many hackers since the beginning of the BFU!!! Too many are using a computer hack to play and cause energy speed ups. It causes the game to lag. Then I loose with an connection error or they just over power me with too many units on the field. Its ridiculous. I will change review when issues with them are fixed.   Now with one day to get to legendary tje game crashed...pathetic. Wish i could give a lower rating",
        "Would love to give 5 stars but I cannot even play. I downloaded, then went to play and got as far as the \"logging on\" page before the game said \"error no network connection\" when I clearly am connected.  EDIT : the issue has been resolved. Changed my rating to 5 stars as promised"

        "Let me say that this game is sooooo good. It is the best Pokemon inspired game on mobile (possibly ever?) and highly addicting. The story is engaging and the graphics are beautiful and the nexomon you capture are well drawn and fun to battle with. Amazing game! Hope to see expansions in the future. For only $1 ($.99 cents to be exact) you get so much content. I wouldn't have minded paying $5 honestly (it's just that good)",
        "Just finished the game this evening. Overall impression is wonderful. The game play is smooth, and addictive. The controls are just fine. The story line is wonderful; it's very catchy and addicting too. The \"Pokemon\" aspect that many people seek in games is in this one. You do have the ability catch any monster you encounter, and you do use them to fight your battles. The battle system is set up very well, and it's balanced. The customer service is good, too. I had an issue where I deleted a save file and my diamonds didn't transfer over. The game developer reimbursed me with a smile. I strongly recommend this game to anyone looking for a good turn based rpg game on mobile.",
        "Not sure why this game has such a low rating. It's not pay to win like other games that have higher ratings. It's monsters are way better designed then other games in its category. And it runs so smoothly. And alot better colouring then other games to. I feel like this is what the pokemon games should aspire to. Maybe hire a few of there artists haha. Although if any of the game Devs are reading this. Maybe put a search function in the database cause everytime I click it I have to scroll all the way down again. Constantly scrolling down lol",
        "Other then the controls being a little Unresponsive at some times. Nexomon has been one of the best of not the best game I have ever played on the mobile phone and even better then some of my pc games and console games. As soon as I payed for the pro version so that I could use it offline (which was from the start) I've loved the it. I highly recommend it. And will recommend it to my friends.",
        "This game is absolutely amazing graphics are fun and well put together the nexomon are creative and awsome!! Side note: I purchased the 5 dollar gem deal and the 1 dollar premium had no issues. When I returned I tried to purchase another 5 dollar gem deal with caused my game to force close and when I returned my second set of gems did not appear yet my card was charged please reimburse my gems please please please and I will continue to play and buy from you . Your game rocks please help fix my issue 5stars all day",
        "Hands down ...this game is awesome- seriously even my kids say it's as good or better than the new Pokemon games .... The graphics are beautiful and the gameplay fun , it's more than I expected and worth paying for. I hope this company comes out with more like this.  Only bad thing is I had to pay for it on each device it was put on 😒"

If you dont want to spend real money then this game is not for you, you will get stuck on campaign like me and wont be able to upgrade your car for the next mission.",
        "This game is a lot of fun get to customize some great cars . A lot of my favorites and i was surprised to see some cool muscle cars . Very unique collection of cars. This is actually better than their console games. Well recent carbon and most wanted are amazing. The newest are hot garbage. This one is fun.reallywish there was free roam or a sand box room where you can admire and test drive  what you have grinded out so many hours to get. Only bad thing. Also the boxes are too expensive leaving having to grind way too much just for absolutely anything. By the time you get anything good this game servers will be empty.",
        "Thank you for making this awesome game, I love it! I've not had this much fun playing a Need For Speed game in years.. Update 2.9.1 is fantastic. Although after updating, I'm having trouble connecting to the game servers... :/ Hope it gets sorted soon! nevertheless, I look forward to future updates. ;)",
        "It's a great game, graphics are ok, smooth playing. But. There are some ideeas that may do something different. Think about a chat room, or a place where players can do some trades. Think about adding the possibility for players to get vip points for watching videos, or maybe one day..open world gameplay. And there could be a lot more features. Thumbs up if you agree.",
        "All round best racing game I have played so far! That said, the game becomes very difficult as one goes above REP 60. It becomes very time consuming to proceed in the game without spending actual money. Useful stuff becomes harder to obtain via docks and via older races, which is frustrating.",
        "The gameplay/races r so short. It takes less than a minute to finish it. And the police cars than u see in the gameplay don't even do anything they just keep going on on there own, sometimes getting to finish line before u. So basically this would be a perfect game for a three year old but incredibly boring for anyone over the age of 7"

        "The only way i would give this game 5 stars if there was an option to walk around instead of pressing an arrow to jump from cover to cover that ends up breaking cause your enemy's keep shooting at it. You bring all these amazing features but you take away the most important feature in any shooting game: walking around and taking cover where you like.",

I bet this game would be a lot more fun if you could walk around instead of just sitting In one place which is my only complaint. But otherwise overall this game is rather a bit fun if you are looking for a time killer.",

        "Love this game!! I love the challenge with completing levels. There's days I can't get enough of this game. I play every day. I love decorating my tanks. I love when I get infinite time, but It would be nice if we had control over when to use it or the time would stop and be saved for when we return. Sometimes 6 hours is impossible to sit there and just play. One thing that would be nice is if we didn't have to wait 30 mins for a life to renew and could have more friends to  receive more lives and got to use the diamonds we earned amd not be stored in a bank to buy. Other than that I cant complain😉 best game out there and I highly recommend it to all ages.",
        "It's a great game. I play it with my daughter on our freetime it's quite addictive. Its great that you get rewards if you have to watch the movies. The only thing i would change is the reloding of the lives. Half an hour for one life is too long. Every so often you get a few free hours, but you need to have free time to play.I love the fact that we can play using my phone sideways (landscape ) as I have a problem with my wrist. I highly recommend it!",
        "Fishdom is a fun game.  The puzzles are challenging. I would love to see a change to the gifts we can give our neighbors . Such as, the lightening, or fireworks, or an ornament for their aquarium. I would also like to see the diamonds we earn to be available, not stuck in a bank, to be paid for.  Limits could be put on it, of course, but the free one here and there only help once in any puzzle sequence.   Overall, though, its a nice game.",
        "I love this game I just wish it was more interactive with the fish in one's tank. Like when you pet them little hearts appear and one can earn happiness points with so many touches. I also wish that one could still earn something for previous tanks. I have no real reason to visit my first and second tank. I don't earn anything for more decorations and it doesn't get dirty and the fish don't get hungry. I feel bad for them, but I focus on my current tanks.",
        "Got a new tablet for Xmas.   Had game on sd card. Wouldn't transfer to new tablet.  Was on level 105.  Have to start all over again! TORTURE lol. Other games I would just stop but not this one.  I love It!  EDIT...STILL LOVE THIS GAME.  Highly reccommend it!  Some levels are SO difficult but still loving this game Oct 9/17.  DEC 2017.  Still adore this game.  Now my husband plays too.  Best game EVER!"

        "Absolutely love this game. The graphics are gorgeous and the beautiful colors are the main attraction. The gameplay is smooth and the system is easy to understand. Only hindrance would be to those that want to sit down and chug through the game. Simply put, you can't, unless you but in game credits. You'll generally be limited to a few puzzles a day or a good puzzle here and there to eat up the occasional time. It's a calm inducing, fun puzzle game with filled with gorgeous hues through and through",
        "I really enjoy the game, but the monetization method behind it sucks the fun out of it: unless you continuously spend money on in-game credits, you are limited to a few puzzles per day. I would gladly buy this game for, say, $5 if it meant I could play however many levels I wanted, whenever I wanted. Otherwise, a great game, very relaxing and therapeutic. Until the monetization method changes: 3 stars rather than 5.",
        "Edit: changed my rating as I've watched the same ad twice now and it won't update my prisms. Can't be the internet connection as the whole ad shows without interruption! Really enjoy the game and the colours and graffixs are great but the ads after every game are super annoying! If I want more credits I'll watch an ad or at most every 3 games to keep the app free.",
        "I absolutely love this game. Completed all the levels for a few months now and am eagerly awaiting new puzzles! It really allows me to relax but challenge my mind at the same time. :D This game is one of the best colour puzzle games so far when compared to other games such as Blendoku and Color Puzzle. The only thing missing is really just not having enough levels to play.",
        "As many have said this game is relaxing, challenging without being frustrating and its graduated colors are very appeasing to the eye. I do wish I could save the 'puzzle' after its complete without having a heart in it. And even though I mainly play as a relaxing passtime the competitor in me wishes for some stats that rank my ability a little more indepth then 'you did better then the world average' ...  All in all this is well worth the download. Thank you Zut!",
        "I love hue is a simple puzzle game that is relaxing and entertaining. Good for helping me to wind down and chill out. As much as people complain about in game currency, the game is free and i cant fault the method of watching a 30 second ad to be able to play 4 more levels of the game. The developers have to make their money one way or another and its not like the game pops up with ads after every level or bombards you with content you absolutely have to pay for. I think this is probably one of the best puzzle game apps on the play store. 5/5 stars for sure"

The game takes you a thrilling adventure, and although the object stays the same I find myself never growing bored. The way that each new character changes the level is just awesome. Each character is well thought out and designed amazingly. If you're looking for a game to pull out in a waiting room, or while you're bored - then give this game a shot. You definitely won't regret it.",
        "It's definitely a fun game. But I cannot figure out where the in app purchases are! I looked everywhere within the app and there is absolutely no place where I can find in app purchases!! But play store says that this game supports in app purchases. So I'm very confused! Can someone please help me out here??",
        "Its awesomr and makes the time go by so quickly. The tiniest problem is that the gas is too little, but thats the point of the game!",
        "This game has so much potential... I started playing and immediately enjoyed it, they've got the game mechanics perfect, everything is easy to get into and the core gameplay is pretty fun. But simple. This usually isn't a problem because game designers usually build complexity ont on top of simple mechanics. Not these guys. The vast majority of jumping platforms, which is all this game is, are incredibly easy to do once you get the hang of it. And that's it. The game doesn't progress at all. It never gets harder. There are some trees and eventually a couple black holes to avoid. Like I mean 3 in the first 100 platforms. Then after platform 100 and something they introduce this drum symbol thing that you can bounce off of. Do they design jumps that implement these bouncy things in a fun and exciting way? Nope. You just go around them. I made it to platform 200 before I finally gave up. This is just lazy game developing.",

I agree that the game is easy once you get a hang of it, but so are games like agario or *cough cough* all of ketchapp *cough cough*  Honestly the devs did excellent, even with ad implementation, all around 10/10 game"

        "It's like this game was made just for me.  I love everything about it.  I hope for future upgrades to keep the game fun and engaging.  The magnet tail needs to be improved a bit, so that the meat doest drag behind.  Also a change of scenery could be cool.",
        "Ads don't work (it always thinks I'm at the 20 day limit) so making any progress in the game is impossible. It's just a grind without any payoff. Really boring.",
        "My only issue right now is I can no longer watch the ads for extras. Every time I try, it just tells me they will refresh in 24 hours.",
        "Fuuuuuuuun! Silly timekiller and a solid game. Ads are not intrusive.",
        "Sometimes there obstacles that I have no choice  but to receive damage the question is what causes less damage like that's not fair. Or when the tank comes. Before it comes it shoots a missle how am I supposed to predict where the missle is going to be at if it gets fired before I can even see the tank. And several other things I would love to point out but I'm sure I can only type so many characters. I genuinely like playing this game a few fixes can make it more enjoyable instead of me getting frusterared. Another small suggestion the magnetic tail is a waste the way it is. Mainly the meat gets dragged around and gets left behind. Maby make it to where with each upgrade it increases the circumference of its pull and actually pulls them to you instead of dragging and leaving behind. Any ways of you would like to hear more ideas let me know. Also I'm just going out on a hunch whoever made this game is not the one fixing it. Game create out creating games and intern or whatever is the one doing the \"pollishing\" to the game and is making it worse. So someone who knows what they are doing needs to be doing the corrections not some dumbass you found down the road if that's the case. Everyone should see the difference in the signature and everyone has a unique signature aka trade mark."

Meaning you need to pay to do them. I really find it a nice read but since the books are few i'm on hold on purchasing diamonds. I guess once a series is completed i'm willing to buy diamonds to replay that game. For now i'm just browsing the game and taking notes on how many diamonds are going to cost per book.",
        "This game is amazing! The graphic is pretty great, plus the story is super ADDICTIVE. I can't stop reading this story but because of I have no pass left. However the problem is the pass, the pass is too little and the time is pretty long to wait. I hope this app would give much pass and please make the time shorter. But still this game is awesome, I recommend this game for you. You should download this app and try it."

        "Love it. Been playing for over a year. You can earn gems slowly to get premium characters or spend money to get them. However you do not need premium characters to play the game. I think people forget that your \"FREE\" games have to make money some how to pay developers, animators, IT support and more. Either they have dozens of ads everyday (DK has a few but not dozens) or premium paid content.",
        "Most addictive game! Playing it since it 1st started. Love the new mystery event it's so adorable except your missing one vital character!!  I think there's a couple points to improve on... the send home button in the characters actions list I think should be up the top and smaller instead of scrolling down for it cos I use it often. 2nd all of the sounds in my game are very poor, it's nearly always silent and music is always late. Haven't heard the high 5 sound in ages 😔 please fix the sound!",
        "The game is fun and all, but do you think you guys could get this game optimized for the Lenovo tablets? I had to get a new tablet since previous one broke. Now the game keeps closing out on me when I'm trying to do something. Think you guys can fix this somehow?  I'd appreciate it if you do. Thanks in advance.",
        "This game has given me nothing but problems. Every update has to have a glitch. First there was a problem when ever I tried to open a chest. Then an update came and After that update now the consetion stands close out the game anytime I want to view. Now with winnie the poo update the whole dam game is slow. Seriously thinking of quiting. It doesn't matter every update has a glitch. Can't u guys fix it? Or is just me?",
        "This is a fun game. Graphics are so very Disney.  I have a question.. WHAT is the reason for the guests to have a character over their head? That is quite distracting..especially when I don't know what their purpose is.  Also..I wish their leveling up and their quests weren't so long..I only get to play about 5 minutes. But I do love the game",
        "This game is amazing! I love it so much! It just reminds me of my childhood, and of all of the TV shows I used to watch. I have only 1 problem with this game, it does not count time when you go out of the game or close your phone. It might just be me, but if it wasn't for the bad saving, I would have given this game 5 stars, since it deserves it, or even more."

They should have ways to earn more tickets, and give you at least 5 tickets. Lol ...I thought the characters talked, but they don't. So that'll be a fun if they add that in. I've been play bad boys and I like it.",
        "This game is amazing. I can play and discover many interesting stories. But I have a problem its an issue long ago. It's about connecting to the network because the app in my phone can't connect well to the internet its an error. PLEASE fix it...😣😣😣",
        "Great story's to read.the ones I love to read is Isak &Finn.what can I say I love all stories and some are my favorite ones I just read over and over,like Love is a Drug.p.s I was playing pitch perfect in the deep treble it only let me go up to 18 only and know that I want to play it it takes me back to my favorite.",
        "I think that if u like drama u should get this app. I've always loved this app I always get upset when I loose the ticket thingys cuz I'm at a good part of the story lol 😂 but ya I give it a 5 stars. I LOVE IT 💕",
        "Its great but should include more stories that you get to not only customize your character but also choose your romances, career, Paths. And so much more but overall the app is great",
        "I can't see my full screen! I cannot even see one word our my character in the story! I see one little fragment of the game! This game is a horrible game! I would be nice if I could actully see the game!"
