        "I'm a sports junkie so of course this game drew my attention. Wasn't sure about the gameplay at first, but I like this game enough to play everyday. I actually have some decent ideas for this game that could put it over the top. If the app developers actually read this review then you should contact me. I have ideas that would make this game have an even broader spectrum in the marketplace, reaching not only sports nuts like myself, but gamers in general.",
        "I like the plays, plus you can put it on auto and watch it if you get tired. Just one problem. Your Dev people need to look into this: I thought if the spinner landed in the bright green, your play would go the yards it was supposed to. If it landed in the dark green, your play would gain a few more yards. Now the bad stuff. If the spinner landed in the bright red, your play and your opponent's play would fail and if it landed in the dark red, the ball was either fumbled or intercepted, depending upon the play. That's what happens to me, but not to my opponent. Many times when the spinner goes to the red, between the 40 yard line and the goal line, he will spin, and the spinner landed in the red. He will get a touchdown. His play was supposed to fail.",
        "I love this game alot but it's getting annoying now. I had to restart bc I lost my other game but my team is about 80points good. I just lost to a team that has 40. I find that sad. My team is way better. Not the first time bc I've lost to a 40,46,50,63,75. Please make it harder for teams that are low beat a time higher then them. Make it more challenging for teams that are lower",
        "I like the game overall but the clock management is really bad. Like 40 seconds for a play? At least add timeouts or make the plays not waste so much time. Also yall should add playoffs for the season, not jus win win win and win. It should be more competitive in the season mode and not just winning cause it gets boring. That's what I suggest but overall the game is good . Pls reply and make a huge update . :)",
        "Are you kidding me. Blitz doesnt help against the run. It absolutly does. And you are seriously telling me that i cant make 10 passing plays in a row. I absolutly can in real life. So unrealistic.",
        "Other than you can't see a lot of the plays it's a really good game. But one thing .you guys should put more indept into the game by letting us see more plays .instead of only the plays that counts. I myself want to see indept plays. But other than that. It a great game"

That is a business model that questions any real money I would put into it. Don't bait freemium users into wasted effort. Good thing I realize this before I spent any real money here.",

The game runs smooth ,the graphics are abit like 2bit graphics like the old Mario games but after all it is a free game and it passes the time so can't complain. All in all not a bad game, It makes a change from the tap tap tap games.",

Had me hooked at first but it became way way too easy and after setting up auto flip it does it all for you. Needs rethinking pretty much completed in 2 day of playing it. Defiantly not voodoos best game.",

Yes its just a game but the object is to earn the cash to buy new items to flip but pointless if the game dont give you the money to progress",

        "I love this game, and it has a fairy tale event where you can make your character look like natzu, Grey, Lucy, Erza and a few more! You can also customise your character in many ways sych as dresses, Armour, and more. There is also a thing where you can make your armour look like a different armour (Transmography (sorry still in a wow mood))",
        "AWESOME!!! LOVE THE FACT IT'S ANIME! Also, if you haven't already done a spirited away or soul eater collaboration, I suggest you do it. Oh, and are people supposed to curse here? Because they curse a lot. Oh, and a Bleach collaboration would be nice if you haven't done that one either. THESE HATERS DO NOT UNDERSTAND THE AMAZING BEAUTY IN THIS GAME!!!",
        "Since recently you have been doing Anime collabs, I was wondering if one of the next ones could be Voltron? I admire the work you put into the characters in the games style but also looking like the characters. ^.^",
        "Really Ateam? So I have two monsters that require the awakening ninoyu to awaken. The small pack for me is 27,99$ and the big one 42,99$. Keep in mind I've never bought one before. Yet my friend only needs 24,99$ for the small one and 37,99$ for the big pack. Really?? Why??",
        "the art style is nice and cute, it is a really fun game to play specially if your a hardcore gamer, and you can fully costumize your characters appearance which is one reason i really like this game, i recommend this game if you like grinding your character and other stuff, and for the story it is also good.",
        "Started playing for the Fairy Tail event.  Already have Lucy and Zeref from just my first day playing, and level 40 character after just a few hours.  Warning, highly addicting."

Have been playing it since 5 days but recently like 2 days ago it keep saying I have reached my daily limit for exp, gold and even daily missions not resetting. I even didn't play like more than 24hs but it's still the same. Game is running smooth I'm getting my daily log in reward but not mission rewards, gold and exp from matches.",
        "This game is great! It has the potential to be one of, if not the best on Google Play marketplace. The graphics are excellent, the sound is immersive, and the controls are almost spot on. Almost because we need the developers to fully implement the use of the Moga Pro controller. Kudos to the developer for a great app, and please please please add Moga Pro support.",
        "Nice gameplay but the game crashes sometimes which result losing moral points and losing a critical game. I would suggest to add more heroes and farster way to earn gold or gems because buying or crafting components would take ages for you to complete and heroes.. anyways its one of my fave now to play..",
        "Game has Great potential but the lag makes it unplayable. Wi-Fi and mobile data same issues. Deleting the game until I hear about any of the issues being addressed.",

It is silly to invest an hour into exploring only to lose it all because of an extra click, especially when you have a bunch of telaports. When player runs out of food, options should be camp, teleport, or suicide...and suicide should NOT be clicking anywhere on the screen. Provide a button.",
        "The game looks okay i mean the graphics can always be better. One problem I've seen is the arena, you always match players qith players that far outmatch their line up which appears to be an unfair gameplay. Looks more and more ridiculous when you match players who have considerably lower stars (which indicates promoted heroes) to players who are far more advanced and much stronger than they are. Otherwise the gameplay seems good snd somewhat challenging. Would have given a five star had the arena been a much more fair match play",

        "While this game is simple, it is kind of mindlessly fun. The problem with it, and thus the two star rating(something I changed from a Four to Two), is that this game suffers from far too many ads. While understandable for something like a reward, this game subjects you to ads just about every time you change a screen. It goes from a little irritating, to absolutely frustrating. Unless you wish to pay two dollars for something that probably wouldn't be worth it for 99 cents, I'd recommend avoiding it.",

        "It annoys me that you have only so many rebuilds but as many breaks as you like. Sometimes you have to dig to find a spot you haven't painted as they are ridiculously hidden. Sadly due to as many breaks as I like but only a few rebuilds I have messed up figures I don't want to display.",
        "This game is ridiculous. You shouldn't have to pay for almost everything... My thing is I finish pictures quickly which is why I have a problem with the fact that there aren't many free ones. And you say there are more free pictures than ones you have to pay for but it sure doesn't seem like it.",
        "I see a lot of comments about the payments and such like and while that is absurd, I'd like to point out a a couple game play issues. First, I found the toolbar more often than not was interfering with me actually playing the game. Secondly, the camera controls were, at best, clunky.",
        "this is completely ridiculous. literally u have to pay for everything. the ones that r free don't even look good. barely any r free. and i don't pay for games. i don't recommend this app.",

        "Hasn't even been 10 seconds into the game before it shut down 🤣 - I thought it would be different for me as I have the S8+. Obviously NOT. The game started off very well and easy to navigate. Ease of controls. I will uninstall as there isn't much point keeping this game when it has already failed itself.",
        "Let's be honest here. The concept was very creative and unique, but the game was very poorly designed. The slide is not smooth and   feels very unstable, I wasn't able to enjoy playing the game. The graphics are very low and the game itself is slow. Apart from that the idea was very well thought of but I feel you should have added more time and professionalism into the whole design, the game has potential.",
        "I really like this app but the the amount of ads are crazy! Wayyy too many. On a good note, the personalisation. I really like the different range of balls and the night time vortex, where everything stands out, and is all black. The trails are really neat too! Although the ball is quite sensitive when dodging around the obstacles. It is still great! I got a score of 104 on my second go! I'd definitely recommend this app! Also i have the samsung galaxy s4 so you can definitely 8nstall this if you have the same phone as me!😊",
        "It is shuting down again and again, in starting that  heppen after 2-3 min then under 1 min and now I open and it shut down in few seconds. For my Moto x play runing 7.1.1  Love concept and game environment.  Control is fine.  Graphic are good.",
        "One thing I find annoying is the adds! The game itself is addicting, but every time you die you have to sit through these long adds. I guess you could pay for the game without adds, but if your like me and you don't really like spending money at the app store, patience my friend... the game is worth it...",
        "It's hard to control and there are WAY too many ads. It lags so I'll be doing fine but it'll make me crash because it paused for a brief moment. If all this was improved, I'd love it. I love the concept of the game but everything else sucks."

It's so awesome and I absolutely love how everything is pixelated and that makes it more charming. Not to mention that the music is fantastic as well and I never get tired of listening to it!",

        "this game is basically an app for watching ads. you are forced to watch ads in order to progress. on the top of that, when you upgrade your stuff, the game randomly starts an ad. to have double money, you have to watch an ad. to collect diamonds.. guess what, watch an ad. to start idle mode? yes, watch an ad. utterly disgusting, terrible design.",
        "Holy ads! Intrusive ads every few clicks. EVERYTHING is ad-based. Good gameplay, but obviously an app created to generate ad revenue.",
        "Really has a satisfying gameplay to it as you upgrade and become more powerful. However the gem portion gets quite slow and boring. Ive spent well over a week on the gem part and am only on the 5th special gun.",
        "This would be a fine time-waster if they reign in the ads, until that happens, about like the plague.  They started out as a means to (optional) easy buffs. Fine, annoying, but not that bad. Suddenly, random ads are popping up in the middle of the game and you get nothing out of it. Totally unacceptable way to run a game. Don't bother, there are thousands of other time wasting idle/incremental games that show an ounce of respect for their customers. These guys simply don't."

Add more staff like real (VRchat) staff  If can make server for language because a lot people here have different language i don't understand at all =.=  And one more Add created avatar for our own....",
        "This is very interesting. hey,game dev. Is it possible that you can make an add characters or custom characters action? If you can I'd  appreciate it my little sister loves VR chat and she's been dying to find a game that is like vrchat but is on the phone. I really appreciate that of you can make that possible she would be so happy",
        "I love it! It's really fun and full of a lot of funny people. I sometimes have problems with the dove avatar  (it does not show up sometimes)  And 1 last thing. If you could (you most likely won't) would you add in custom avatars?",
        "Devs pls add vr mode ireally2 happy to sew this game. Im weating for the next update devs. Goodjob get 1m rate 😍😚 sorry for my bad english. Ilove u devs god well bless u 😇😍😙💕",
        "It's a good game but really need some improvements . Most important is a language filter. Please put a language filter which could be mandatory or not to filter the language.  But in my experience it was very hard to find a single person with my own language.  Second , there are some bugs in the gameplay. Like my character sometimes went out if the corridor path.  That mic holding is annoying too. It should be of click type not the hold one.  That's all for now but if I will have some other issues I'll let u know.",
        "Dude ots so awesome and fun but you need to add like (more emoji style,more anime boy,friends request,costum avatar, jump button also when we walk,its so fast,you need to slow it down somemore..i hope its helps you also i hope this game geting better in future"

        "A great fast paced game. Good graphics and a large variety of real looking sushi. You earn coins to upgrade everything. One of the best sushi games out. If you switch off WiFi no problem with ads. But the third restaurant keeps freezing and booting me out. It is impossible to pass this level 63 as well with all upgrades and perfectly happy customers. Been trying for days and am now deleting 😐",
        "Nice time killer Fun little game. Doesn't force you to do upgrades after the first round. A lot of ads, but that's every free game. Unsure how further levels will play out, if I'll be forced to buy gold, or wait 4 weeks of playing/earning to do 1 upgrade. For now, fun.",
        "Great but... When purchasing upgrades I should be able to see a description before purchase. Hearts do go down fast but not terrible. I hate the ads. How do I buy it outright? You need to implement a button dedicated to buying the game. This game is fun, fast-paced, addictive and easy to figure out even with the broken English. I'll give five stars when a buy game button is created and descriptions are added for shop purchases. Also, a tutorial for the shop would be nice because I played 30 levels before finding it.",
        "Make sure levels work! Couldn't get past level 5! I was liking the game... But in level 5 they don't GIVE you the ingredient for one of the new sushi rolls, nor does it allow you to purchase it with earned coins from other rolls. Making level 5 IMPOSSIBLE. So I can't even keep playing this game... 20 minutes after playing and downloading it. such a shame! At least make sure the levels work!!!!!",
        "Addictive Its mostly time management that you have to handle in this game, but it's fun. I've heard that part 2 was expensive when it came to buying things but this has endless so that you can make money to buy upgrades. But the English in this game is a little off, but that's fine with me",
        "Pretty fun This game is pretty fun but once you get all the upgrades it is impossible to beat the last 3 levels in stage three without another upgrade and I used all my upgrades. So I gave up because I couldn't get pass level 66. Oh well."

        "I'm sorry but this game is so boring for me. And the chore is too repetetive. Maybe because I dont understand Mark's life. Never been there. There's nothing exciting about it. No matter what you choose in the game they all end up the same. I dont recommend this game if you have to pay",
        "Hey everyone, the only complaint i have is that when you accidently skip a nice text, you cannot read briefs or go back to see what you missed. Which ends up leaving you a bit confused on what happened as well as not knowing the main part of this game, whixh is the story line. Great game so far im on the seocnd day but i suggest no one skip texts accidently. Watch your fingers for the screen",
        "Shows a glimpse of high school students and how... weird their lifes can be. It's Dark, to say the least. The only thing I suggest improving is the grammar. I mean it's not that bad that you can't understand the sentences but still you should really fix it. Also can create a sequel or something because I'm really not able to get closure.",
        "The game was really good, I could relate to the character, the graphics were really good and the story was also a good one. I only have two problems with it. The grammar, that needs to be improved as there are a lot of mistakes. And the bloody ending. I won't spoil it but it was the most terrible way they could've ended the game.",
        "Bad English. There were times were I couldn't even understand it. The game was okay. There was an element of depression but just the surface part of it. It hooked for a while but the game was just too repeatetive. Yeah, you could say that the game intended it to be that way but I still thought there should be at least a little difference in gameplay as you progress considering there are only 13 days to play (-1 day of unconsciousness)",
        "The only good thing is the artstyle. Even then, it's not great. The grey pallette is really good at setting the tone and the low-res gives a foggy feeling.   The writing is bad on every level. The characters are flat, the setting is so over-the-top sad that it's funny, there's no real story, things come out of nowhere, the grammar is bad enough to take the emotional weight out of suicide and cancer, and so much more that I don't care enough to mention.  The sound design is pretty good. Not much to say there."

You can go to diffrent places to get outfit,makeup and hair done. They actually give you a report card with all your classsess and grade. You can peform in front of an audience and you can battle people at the battle arena. Finally my favorite part of this game BOY DRAMA AND GIRL DRAMA it's amazing. DOWNLOAD THIS GAME RIGHT NOW!!!!!!!!!",
        "I love the quality of the game. Great time killer.Brings out my inner Ballerina lol. Easy, Fun.Game The only thing so far i dont like is wadrobe. For example If your swiching btwn classess its hard to complety take off i.e jacket, tights or pants from previous classes. If u pick certain outfits there stuck on you. Please fix. Other then that good game.",
        "I'm not much of a dance gamer but I love simulation games. This one in particular is very innovative with their design and gameplay. I was skeptical of how I was going to like it at first but it proved me wrong and I immediately took to it. The controls are easy to learn and I don't even mind all of the ads. Honestly, a really great game.",
        "I love this game! It is really fun and if you like dancing then this is the one for you! Personally I like gymnastics more but that's because I've come a long way in it. The only thing that you could change is the amount of ads are! There are so many of them! But over all this game is great! 😉😉",
        "Honestly, one of the best games that I ever played. Dont care much for the ads. Just turn off your data and none of the ads will come out😉 But just like what the other reviewers are saying, the option to choose and take off certain clothes are limited. But other than that, great game.",
        "This game is glitchy, the story line is inconsitent, you have to always keep watching ads. On top of that you rehearse multiple times and it doesnt tell you have to get an a. I picked ballet and forced me to do hip hop for season 2. I tried to like it, but it's glitches before the dance perfomance how am I supposed to remeber the routine when i watch multiple ads and do routines that are not ment to be for the perfomance. Idk if its glitch ir a bug but it's just really bad. It is a cute game. Just not consistent."

        "Oh wow.. You have got to be kidding me..play limits and an energy system? On the small amount of free content available?? On a chess exercise game with a recurring subscription fee to fully unlock?? Every single thing about this game is designed to be such a ridiculous money grab I actually laughed. It does have a very nice interface but there are a lot of completely free or one time purchase alternatives that are every bit as good.. Definitely don't waste your time and money on this..",
        "OK guys as far as the overall experience with the app was good I could use it all the time to progress my skill at playing chess just like anybody i.e.  any practice  1 possible flaw or idea that I've found which may shift Play Magnus app's popularity is to make a free version of the Magnus Trainer app with only the free content intending this app to be a demo and add more daily activities and challenges to keep them on your app longer  which of course will always end prompting the user to download Premium Magnus which requires an initial $5.00  purchase to begin downloading Magnus Trainer Premium enabling user full access to all the content app offers them. Followed by subscription payments made monthly at the set price of $5.   Might be dumb idea but food for thought I know Runescape had their free server separated from Members only servers also at $5 / mo.  People may  be able  to understand more clearly that if they want the full  app to get way better skills on the board if they want lessons of this caliber then it requires subscriptions to support your hard working team.   The haters will always hate... Keep it up good app",

I have to replay the boring levels because it won't merge the old version to this one, even though I'm \"connected through fb\" and playing the last updated version isn't an option because it keeps crashing :/ almost ready to delete the whole thing and play a different game altogether. Admin if you can fix this issue, I'll update with 5 stars",

And this update and version of a thing I have two cookie crush in my phone  but that's not how it's supposed to,  please do something about it... Thanks",

        "The new version of the game isn't that good,constant freezing in middle of games. I didn't get the gifts that were stated when I downloaded this new app. Also I've had start at the beginning but was on 400+ levels in previous app. Not enjoying it and the graphics are awful.",
        "I want to say thanks for helping me with my previous problem but now after each level the game shuts down and sometimes it shuts down while I'm playing and so far I haven't been able to collect any coins.  Its robbed me of 30 coins so far.  This is why I gave it an I'm not sure rating at this time.  Can't finish playing a level now without the game shutting down.  Please fix this.",

        "Love the game. Definitly think 8ts rigged on tower of fortune for sure. Az for going through 3 different phones with the app i have actually had luck linking it with my fb never had an issue. It would be alot better if non active clan members could get kicked. Im trying to achieve the legendary chest which is impossible with maybe only 8 active people. Other than that its pretty addicting. I play every morning before work and every night before bed. Plenty of levels to keep busy!",
        "The puzzles are interesting, the animations are generally enjoyable. It quickly becomes a grind, though, where you aren't enjoying the gameplay, you're just trying to get past the timewasters of the daily challenge, or fighting the arbitrary points of the arena. The clan battles and Mighty Eagle challenge are the best parts, but you can't play them all the time. You have to grind away in the Arena.",
        "I just purchased a new phone. And being I'm using the same e-mail address i would have thought it would have started me at the same level I had been on prior to the new phone. Kinda sucks because i had spent a near fortune and was at level 64 ! Unless they can fix this I will remove the game for good. I mean I had every hat except the ones that cost 25,000. Now I'm at zero!",
        "RESUBMITTED: Arena games were sucked up by those high-card players or maybe cheaters. My power cards are the same, just like my opponent, or higher than my opponent's cards. When I slinging those piggies or blocks, it gives me lower points like 4 hundred thousand. But if my opponent slinging them all, it gives higher points like 7.5 million. I lost my winning streaks so I had to play again but it gives me same points so I lost again, sadly. I thought your arena games are really much fun, but they're not.",
        "Classic gameply bogged down by aggravating fremium distration. Havent run into any energy bars yet and already on second world. New birds add interesting gameplay elements but spells are an automatic win that add no semse of achievement besides skipping a hard level. If you want some classic angry birds but dont mind clicking through to get to it then give this a download.",
        "He game starts out with tutorials, but they act like you've never played angry birds before. Theres a world map which is cool, but its not needed and is just boring. The worst part about this game is that you can only lose 5 times a day. I just want to play the game like how the original game played!"

I had music playing at it got interupted by a add, mind you that my phone was in sleep mode, and it scared me half to death cause all I heard was a roaring sound come from my phone.",

If u do I would love to download this app again although it did annoy how every time I finished a round I would get an add straight away and that ment I didn't finish very many",

I downloaded your great game TO PLAY it. Please try to solve this issue. I will definitely give you 5 stars if you fix this. Please listen to us and read our comments. Most of us are mentioning this 1 -ve point. Thank you",
        "Great game but seriously?  The feul tho.  It takes 30 minutes to charge and it's only 5 as the limit.  Cmon that's bad!  I love this game and it has great graphics and it's a great time killer but please make the fuel like to 10 or make it 10 minutes to recharge.  If so I'll rate 5 star$",
        "This game deserves to be the best game of the year. Its so simple and yet mesmerizing. It is also very fast so you won't get frustrated and could play this game for hours (or until the fuel runs out :-P). This game is quite exciting and the visuals are also nice. This game deserves more than 5 stars. The music blends in quite well and jobs make it more fun. Their are many sources from which you can get rewards which makes it easy and challenging to play. I love this game. Also you can buy more fuel slots in the shop for 100 diamonds. Its expensive but I don't need it beacuse I have to keep track of the time and only play until the fuel runs out.",
        "Really good idea let down massively by the developers. Progress is extremely slow due to fuel taking so long to recharge and having to use gems to buy new vehicles. So unless you want to spend all your money on a free game, it doesn't really feel like you're getting anywhere.",
        "Not too bad. I would have like to see the car while playing, and the graphics could be a touch better. I would honestly like an option between dragging your finger and using buttons on either side of the screen. That alone would have given this a 5-star rating from me",
        "It shouldn't be easier to level up rather than actually playing game. I wouldn't say that the gameplay is difficult to play, but the purposefully placed trucks that shoot you is a bit ridiculous. Other cars are in the way which ultimately eliminates you before you can attack the shooting trucks. There really is no challenge except trying to beat your previous score. I give this game an eh out eh."

        "At first I liked it till I tried the game where you compete against the big bird. I make a word from letters seen but the bird  makes or from unseen letters and words that are very uncommon. What is a Hexad?  Those letters were not even showing, so how they come out of thin air and then bear what I. Have chosen.  Not fair at all so.changing my 4 stars to 1",
        "This is one of the perfect games I've played,  it is also fun and can pass time very easily because once you start you can't put it down. Also there are not any annoying adverts,  it is also educational for children to learn new words, that's why I've given this game 5 *****. Thanks!!!!",
        "The game is great. I love how much attention went into making this game, it gets a lil boring (for me personally) sometimes.  Had a few glitches, like one time when I made a move, somehow a blue \"sapphire\" and a blocker square became one square.... which sucked, because I couldn't make a match, that I otherwise could have made.   But I really do love this game.... one of my favorites,  love the challenge level, not too easy, yet not too hard either. One day I'll go back though and try for 3 suns on all levels!! Keep up the great work.",
        "Overall a good game lots of levels. Couple of complaints, sometimes impossible to get 2 or 3 stars regardless how well you do. In \"endless mode\" computer usually comes up with words I have never heard of before. Player can never win. If player lost a life but wins a future round why can't we regain a life? Not fun if you know you can never win endless mode.",
        "So cute! I love the sound effects and the story of those little languinis. This is not timed so you are able to put it down/look up to do what you need to do.",
        "Just started playing today. So far so good. Other reviews complain of glitches. Nothing yet.🇨🇦"

The other thing is u should make it where u only need to eat 2 fish to get full health or at least add a fish catcher so u don't have to stand there and keep catching one fish at a time but other then that I love the game one of the best survival games I have played so far and I have played almost all of them keep the good work up this game will go far",

They're not well-distributed, having reached a point where no ads would show up after a few runs, and then one would appear after every run no matter how short. A 30 second ad after a run that ended in just a couple seconds? Multiple times in a row? I understand ads needs to be there, but I'd like to have more play time than ad time.",
        "Very enjoyable game, quite addictive and jumping back into a new game is quick. Couple of gripes, there seems to be some slow down or framrate dipping after an ad has shown and the option to remove ads isn't working. Sort this out and it will get another 2 stars",
        "The game itself is pretty fun. I think I'd like it. But the ads are far, far too intrusive. Not only are there too many. But, many of them have timers. Some are 30 seconds, and you can't break out. Too annoying. I have no interest I sitting and waiting for ads to finish",
        "Wow!!!! I've never been more annoyed with an app in my life!!! I would play this game all day long but the amount of ads are literally driving me insane! Two runs and another 15 second ad comes up. No thanks",
        "Ads pop up during gameplay where your fingers contact so it stops game play ... other than that it's good but I've had enough. Fk you chilly:-p uninstalling",
        "This game was my favorite of any maybe ever. I played all the time, then there was an update and I had to uninstall. It made the app close constantly (even when it wasn't even open and I was in other apps), there's way too many ads that make me want to vomit, and it stats to lag now when it never did before. Someone at corporate ruined this game. Smh."

        "I liked the game so much. No! I love it, but it's just that I'm now on level 65 but I'm stucked since I only have few gems left and I needed to extend the time, and buy some customers which I find amazing just to save your energy and the stage but I also find it hard since I have already completed 3 stars from lower levels and why is it that I can't play the levels I have already completed? I would really suggest that lower levels would still be played just to be able to collect gems. I hope you can fix this issue though. I'm so loving this game and I'm getting addicted to it. I got stucked on level 65 on my two days of playing. Thank you",
        "Moving on is hard on some levels because they are specifically designed for you to use gems and they are hard to come by. However, If you are patient enough you can eventually earn them. I enjoy that you don't have to drag the items to the customers. It's definitely an enjoyable and challenging game. I'm currently at a \"coming soon\" stage where I can no longer move ahead. I've been waiting a long time and do not want to wait forever. Please do an update soon!!!",
        "I love this game! So few games actually suck me in, but this game had me addicted right away. I play on my phone and laptop. Yes I have two different games at different levels lol. I love how upgrades are so easy and it isn't impossible to upgrade or move on. It gets challenging as you go up levels but it's so fun.",
        "It's fun till you run out of energy. They get you too rate the game right away while you are having fun with free lives. Give you enough lives to rate it good then the lives end and you have to watch a min advert or 30 mins for one life Regen. OR PAY. They just want your money at that point. So sad.",
        "Brilliant little time waster of a game.. yet.. once you start getting to the higher levels.. the less chance of earning gems and i aint noway paying for them.. last time I stupidly paid for gems on cooking fever..and got my account hacked into! Big lesson learnt! I do still play this alot tho so overall, definitely a good game. 👍",
        "Some levels are nearly impossible to beat without help. Also I dislike that if you're about to lose due to food burning or an angry customer that there's no additional warning until it's too late. Then you have to sit there and stare at your warning till your level is lost and over. Other than those 2 things I greatly enjoy playing."

Then you will work your way up getting better gear and so forth. BUT the game is generous with ads. Too many advertisements for the little gameplay there is. The translation is spotty but works good enough for me.",

I don't know why this is happening but it sucks because it's putting me off the game.. it's like 8 ball is making sure I'm losing hence the rate 3",
        "Great 8 ball pool game. Plays great and looks great. 1 slight issue tho. Im from Ireland but i seem to be playing people from India and surrounding countries.   The Irish and Indian flag are kind of similar so im guessing thats where the issue is coming from.  I cant seem to edit my location either.  Would be great if someone could help but if not, ill be happy to continue playing against random beautiful Indian women 😁",

I was just about to win when i hit my solid ball and then last black ball was left but the ball goes in opponents hand said that you didn't hit your ball.. what was that? Can you please stop all these hacks and all for other users. There is no fair gameplay between each other.. please do some favourable to all users.  Hope you will take quick action in this manner Thanks.. Apoorv",
        "The game is very good. But that spin wheel is not fair at all. I've been playing this game for 6 years now (I know there used to be 1 coin reward there) and I've never got anything more than 2500 coin reward. My point is if you are keeping other rewards on that wheel atleast give equal probabilities for each reward. If not, just remove those big rewards and replace them with small ones but atleast with same probability for each of them. Hope you will do something. (P.S. i know it's a lucrative strategy developers play so that players will stick to the game. But you know just trying.✌️)",

Also there needs to be time to clean up the map once The main objective is completed and definently more chalice for chances to complete levels, I only have a certain amount of time to play so I need to fit it into my time, not yours.... Ok game but not a great game for the players, micro-transaction heavy and very little chances to complete the levels.",
        "Really enjoy the game. Relaxing and addicting. However, i dont like the large amounts of lock chests taking up my camp space. I think the lock chests are too much of a push to get me to buy crystals. Chances of getting crystals seem slim and with the small amount of space available for other things, this is a down side for me. If i have to pay to open chests that i have been rewarded, why play? That might be  something that causes me to quit the game before too long.",
        "When I first downloaded this game it was fun...now, all the dragons only have a stamina of 1 and now you need trophies to play levels. These trophies take f-o-r-e-v-e-r to accumulate. These things have made the game drag on way too long. And accomplishing any thing may also cost actual money now. I have read other reviews about the money system of this game and I will not be throwing my money down this drain.",

        "Loved this game at the start. But since last update it has crashed on me several times. Today alone it has crashed on me 3 times. I lost all my camp progress each time and had to start again and of course each time is different because it is impossible to duplicate. Today I also lost my dragon gems and dragons I had created prior to crashes. There fore I lost my money spent. I also lost my daily chest which  contained 2 life trees and a super egg fragment.  I am very upset and dissatisfied now and regret spending money on this game that I loved prior to all the crashes.",
        "Please remove The Challenges. The timer runs out too early on all of the challenges, all the way up to challenge 20. I have all the standard levels finished. I have been waiting for you to make new standard levels. The timer is cheating people in your challenges. There is no way they can be completed. I am not buying 50 gems to add 2 minutes. That's a waste of my money."

Please make some changes to those",

For example \"Zero\" character to have +8 bullet pircing and +12 reload, and other characters to have +2, +6, +9, +13, +18... also for weapon is the same thing... make all caracteristics different.

        "This game is actually okay for a mobile app. The downside unfortunately - as with so many - is that there is never quite enough of anything to progress without spending a considerable amount of money. I invested a lot of time on the zombie event only to find that time was running out and I would not be able to complete it without stumping up a relative fortune. I would have bought this game but refuse to pay to play and watch a ton of advertising in the hopes of getting the gold or tickets or cash or whatever. For what you might pay for stuff like this go and buy a console game. Heck you could buy the console as well on what uou could save avoiding this. Deleting it right niw. Adios greedy developers"

        "Very fun game. Multiplayer is awsome! Please add private matches so i can play with friends.   Physics still need work to hold up to real world standard. Rocks dont follow thru on take outs in real life as they do in this game. Also (rules), a rock needs to make it all the way over the hogline in order to stay in play.  Thank you for making this game!",
        "Best curling game I've seen Enjoy the graphics, controls, love the 1 on 1 against international players and career game options. Seems consistent and easy to learn. Needs a few tweaks like... throws that don't make hog line or touch hogline must be taken out of play. Have seen the bug that others reported, sometimes rock after thrown disappears , some kind of glitch that happens occasionally.  Sometimes the sweepers don't react to my movement to sweep. Would love to see 8 stones instead of 6. If you love curling, this should satisfy",
        "Great game and takes a little practice, although I don't get the automatic movement at the end of some throws. Is this the hackers people talk about. Its not always in the oppenents advantage but when it happens, the rock positons don't make sense. Anyone know why this happens. If they fix that I would give it 5 stars",
        "Great game except for hackers. There is a hack that allows some to bump or change finish of a throw. Yoy can go from having 2 scoring to opponent having the score, changing after the rocks stopped. Developers have not replied ti report. Fine for some fun but don't waste your money in upgrades",
        "Good fun. Physics seem good, sometimes my sweepers don't sweep at all but I don't think that makes too much difference. I'd like to play alternate ends rather than winner goes first and the rocks don't spin which would add a bit of something to the graphics. I've yet to play online, just practicing against the CPU.",
        "Physics are not like real curling, rocks are dead in the house when hit, physically impossible doubles and triples, improper use of the free guard zone rules (if a rock is in the house, it is free to be removed...not in this game).  Connecting people across the globe is a cool idea but you frequently lose people and you win without finishing a game.  I've played for 35 years so I speak from experience."

        "Hello. I really like the game, but there are a few bugs. Like in multiplayer in drift races theres a bug where it just stops on the timer part and then someone needs to leave. I wish you do more updates like adding a dodge challenger with wheelie kits amd more garage space",
        "Great ass game, just please make the streets more colourful like the buildings and make the road blacker, about the buildings, add light and contrast to the game, overall it's a great game, also plz add porche 911 turbo, nissan gtr, and so on with supercars. Plz also add suspension tuning, engine tuning ( horsepower or torque ), ECU tuning ( how much petrol and oxygen into more or less rpm ), nitrous tuning ( duration or power ), turbocharger tuning ( more psi or less psi ), add engine overheating as I said with the turbo and engine, if more psi or torque the engine will blow, camera angles I hope you add the inside view, and add aerodynamic tuning after you add rims, wings, bumpers, car height, and all that downforce. Plz make the map bigger and add racing tracks, like the URL, let's say about 5 or 6 tracks, plz. And plz make the tyres have designs and patterns and make them darker please. Story mode too, like in NFS most wanted plz. Also you can't hear the cars tire sounds or drift sounds, please, please, please, I beg you turn the tire volume up because I feel like I'm drifting on oil or something.",
        "Great game. Kinda reminds me of Underground 2 and Midnight Club 3. BTW, in the future updates, add the 1999 Mitsubishi Eclipse, Nissan Skyline R32, some muscle cars, more decals and some more upgrades like ECU, Intercooler, Suspension, and Transmission. The only problem is on multiplayer, some races freeze after finishing, fix it. Also add circuit as well!",

        "I'm addicted to this game especially the daily challenge boards. Pros: pencil feature, all instances of the number Are highlighted when you fill in a cell. Con: the timer starts when board opens, would like it to start after filling in 1st cell. As others have said the ads are right below the numbers, too easy to tap when your on a roll.",
        "Just downloaded this app.  So far a very well executed app with excellent layout and controls/easy and fluid to use.  Much better than other Sodoku b/c no ads during actual game play!  The only \"con\" is that I cant put graphics behind gameboard. Only suggestion: Would like to see options for backgrounds like in Solitaire. This would truely make it a 5 star game!   Ps. I was not paid/reimbursed or otherwise incentivised for this review in any way.",
        "I like this app, but it feels like it could be more educational. I get stuck on the expert puzzles and often have to use the hints, the way the hints just tell you the number in a selected square doesn't help me work out what I'm missing. If the hint could show me how I could reveal another number would be more helpful to me. Otherwise top notch app",
        "It's a pretty decent sudoku implementation, far better than a lot of the other ones out there I should say. The only issues I have are firstly I do find the \"penciled\" numbers to be a little on the small side (on a 5.5\" screen). I'd also say that for those of us that don't find the \"expert\" setting particularly difficult (without meaning to sound arrogant), it would be good to have a step above that. And finally a Google Play leaderboard would be a nice addition. None of these are massive problems, it's a good app as I said.",
        "Great app. I can do Sudoku on the app with the 'write' facility for numerical notes and I like how it removes them automatically as you fill in other areas. But I still find it very difficult to do paper Sudokus because I can't fill in the right answers without loads of workings out on the more challenging puzzles. The app makes this aspect easy.",
        "I would greatly prefer to start by touching a number rather than touching a cell.  I have to hunt for a cell with the number I am working with, touch that to show where all instances of that number are, then touch each cell and the number to place either the number or a note that this might be the number.  If I could select the number first, I would only have to touch each cell to place that number, then turn on \"note mode\" and touch each cell for a note.  Only half the taps per game, saving both time and the muscles in my arthritic hands!"

        "Like the game but would be better if resources would come back after a while, or you didn't loose your inventory when you died. Cant play for longer than two mins without dying again looking for wood. No axe, no pick, no wood.....  get killed. Lol",
        "It was very promising game. New update turns game very very hard and unbalanced. To much equipment cost for too little kill reward. Already spent money. But now without real money it is so difficult. No fighting chance at all. Please fix it",
        "This COULD be a great game, but it's a very much unbalanced. Your resources on you area NEVER grow back, so you must travel... I get why that is, but it takes 10-30 minutes, unless of course you want to use energy. You get 100 energy and it takes too much energy to fast travel at the pace that energy is replenished. If you can get around that, and build a few items, tools, weapons, etc. It seems like the game finally gets going but if you die from the 5-10 attackers, you lose ALL of your stuff on you. Everything I've mentioned can of course be fixed by spending a TON of money, but beware, everything has durabilty, and once broken will disappear. So you will always be spending money. CAN'T THERE BE ONE OF THESE GAMES THAT AREN'T MADE OUT OF COMPLETE GREED?",
        "I really like it, but such a slow start, after the initial offering of goodies i just stumble along with constant death, no weapon, lose my bag every death. Very frustrating.",
        "Great game, wish there was something to gain more energy, and a hp, or energy lvl cap off, max hp should go up like 2hp per lvl gained. Idk more stats that the player can tweak for gameplay",
        "The team solved all my issues. Beautiful game, new twist on an already good concept. Loving it! Can't stop! Addicted!"

        "Amazing shooter game, awesome hero collecting game, great multiplayer game. Definitely suggest that you at least try it out. But one thing you should look out for, it's pretty easy to sink between 5 and 20 dollars a week into this. Sometimes even 40 to 60. But, it's pretty free-to-play friendly if you can't afford to buy some gold.",
        "I love this game. It's very dynamic and the gameplay is good too. The only problem I have is every single time I do PvP... It pairs me with an opponent far greater than what I can hope to beat. Sure, that's great for improving, but it disheartens me and makes me feel like a horrible player when I can't even beat ONE PvP opponent, ever, while playing the game. I would suggest to the devs that the matching system be a little more flexible when pairing. Give us a matching system that will actually give us lesser prepared players too so we can have the fun of winning, as well. Also, I am disconnected every single time I do PvP battles and bounties. Quite unstable, unfortunately.",
        "I really like the game. It's fun and has enough activities and quests to keep you occupied for a while. My only complaint is how they match people up for the PVP missions. Sometimes you get matched up with people with far higher power and Team level menu which makes it nearly impossible to win. other than that I really enjoy the game",
        "Super fun game. I haven't got bored of the game because there's always events going on which is good. One of the better if not the best shooting game I've played. I think there is a slight glitch when using Steele. Sometimes after I activate his open fire skill he doesn't shoot when I press the shoot button.",
        "Latest update definitely made the game harder. I used to run 4 gauntlet levels with little issue but now I can't get through 1 without losing people. Resurrected characters are completely unwelcome and unfair in pvp when you tell on kills for money. Probably going to uninstall, you're welcome for the money Hothead",
        "Starts off ok but then the pay walls creep in and you are constantly bombarded with prompts to spend money. The PVP is absolutely pointless, highest power rating wins every time without exception so you know if you've won or lost as soon as it picks an opponent. Needs a lot of work before I'd consider dropping any real money on it."

Edit- ok I'm in again, but I'm still mad, but relieved I didn't throw away my money. OTHER games send a apology message than an update is being performed or something. But as a game it is fun & strategic",

Look at how Clash Royale has their setup. Your already  trying to mimic their game. You should study their gameplay more and use it for improvements. Just saying. Make a change in that 4hr wait.",
        "Since the new update, major loading issues. Game just freezes on the title screen. I noticed that a lot of people have complained about the PVP battles not being fair, but they usually within reason. My main complaint is THE HACKERS WHO DRIVE ME TO THE POINT OF A MENTAL BREAKDOWN. This game has great potential, it just needs the major issues addressed.",

        "Too many hackers since the beginning of the BFU!!! Too many are using a computer hack to play and cause energy speed ups. It causes the game to lag. Then I loose with an connection error or they just over power me with too many units on the field. Its ridiculous. I will change review when issues with them are fixed.   Now with one day to get to legendary tje game crashed...pathetic. Wish i could give a lower rating",
        "Would love to give 5 stars but I cannot even play. I downloaded, then went to play and got as far as the \"logging on\" page before the game said \"error no network connection\" when I clearly am connected.  EDIT : the issue has been resolved. Changed my rating to 5 stars as promised"

        "Let me say that this game is sooooo good. It is the best Pokemon inspired game on mobile (possibly ever?) and highly addicting. The story is engaging and the graphics are beautiful and the nexomon you capture are well drawn and fun to battle with. Amazing game! Hope to see expansions in the future. For only $1 ($.99 cents to be exact) you get so much content. I wouldn't have minded paying $5 honestly (it's just that good)",
        "Just finished the game this evening. Overall impression is wonderful. The game play is smooth, and addictive. The controls are just fine. The story line is wonderful; it's very catchy and addicting too. The \"Pokemon\" aspect that many people seek in games is in this one. You do have the ability catch any monster you encounter, and you do use them to fight your battles. The battle system is set up very well, and it's balanced. The customer service is good, too. I had an issue where I deleted a save file and my diamonds didn't transfer over. The game developer reimbursed me with a smile. I strongly recommend this game to anyone looking for a good turn based rpg game on mobile.",
        "Not sure why this game has such a low rating. It's not pay to win like other games that have higher ratings. It's monsters are way better designed then other games in its category. And it runs so smoothly. And alot better colouring then other games to. I feel like this is what the pokemon games should aspire to. Maybe hire a few of there artists haha. Although if any of the game Devs are reading this. Maybe put a search function in the database cause everytime I click it I have to scroll all the way down again. Constantly scrolling down lol",
        "Other then the controls being a little Unresponsive at some times. Nexomon has been one of the best of not the best game I have ever played on the mobile phone and even better then some of my pc games and console games. As soon as I payed for the pro version so that I could use it offline (which was from the start) I've loved the it. I highly recommend it. And will recommend it to my friends.",
        "This game is absolutely amazing graphics are fun and well put together the nexomon are creative and awsome!! Side note: I purchased the 5 dollar gem deal and the 1 dollar premium had no issues. When I returned I tried to purchase another 5 dollar gem deal with caused my game to force close and when I returned my second set of gems did not appear yet my card was charged please reimburse my gems please please please and I will continue to play and buy from you . Your game rocks please help fix my issue 5stars all day",
        "Hands down ...this game is awesome- seriously even my kids say it's as good or better than the new Pokemon games .... The graphics are beautiful and the gameplay fun , it's more than I expected and worth paying for. I hope this company comes out with more like this.  Only bad thing is I had to pay for it on each device it was put on 😒"

This is actually better than their console games. Well recent carbon and most wanted are amazing. The newest are hot garbage. This one is fun.reallywish there was free roam or a sand box room where you can admire and test drive  what you have grinded out so many hours to get. Only bad thing. Also the boxes are too expensive leaving having to grind way too much just for absolutely anything. By the time you get anything good this game servers will be empty.",

Although after updating, I'm having trouble connecting to the game servers... :/ Hope it gets sorted soon! nevertheless, I look forward to future updates. ;)",
        "It's a great game, graphics are ok, smooth playing. But. There are some ideeas that may do something different. Think about a chat room, or a place where players can do some trades. Think about adding the possibility for players to get vip points for watching videos, or maybe one day..open world gameplay. And there could be a lot more features. Thumbs up if you agree.",
        "All round best racing game I have played so far! That said, the game becomes very difficult as one goes above REP 60. It becomes very time consuming to proceed in the game without spending actual money. Useful stuff becomes harder to obtain via docks and via older races, which is frustrating.",
        "The gameplay/races r so short. It takes less than a minute to finish it. And the police cars than u see in the gameplay don't even do anything they just keep going on on there own, sometimes getting to finish line before u. So basically this would be a perfect game for a three year old but incredibly boring for anyone over the age of 7"

        "The only way i would give this game 5 stars if there was an option to walk around instead of pressing an arrow to jump from cover to cover that ends up breaking cause your enemy's keep shooting at it. You bring all these amazing features but you take away the most important feature in any shooting game: walking around and taking cover where you like.",

I bet this game would be a lot more fun if you could walk around instead of just sitting In one place which is my only complaint. But otherwise overall this game is rather a bit fun if you are looking for a time killer.",

        "I like it.   The fish are friendly and encouraging.  I use the game to help me keep calm and relax.  Please consider allowing us to select another of one of the earlier aquariums when we get to the point where we are waiting for new aquariums to be developed and have finished everything.  I'd like a place to put new fish and decorations, but none of the old fish want to be sold.  They are still my favorite friends.  The game uses a lot of memory, and I had to uninstall it from my tablet because it kept making it crash.  Works on my phone, but it's still a lot of memory.",
        "Love this game!! I love the challenge with completing levels. There's days I can't get enough of this game. I play every day. I love decorating my tanks. I love when I get infinite time, but It would be nice if we had control over when to use it or the time would stop and be saved for when we return. Sometimes 6 hours is impossible to sit there and just play. One thing that would be nice is if we didn't have to wait 30 mins for a life to renew and could have more friends to  receive more lives and got to use the diamonds we earned amd not be stored in a bank to buy. Other than that I cant complain😉 best game out there and I highly recommend it to all ages.",
        "It's a great game. I play it with my daughter on our freetime it's quite addictive. Its great that you get rewards if you have to watch the movies. The only thing i would change is the reloding of the lives. Half an hour for one life is too long. Every so often you get a few free hours, but you need to have free time to play.I love the fact that we can play using my phone sideways (landscape ) as I have a problem with my wrist. I highly recommend it!",
        "Fishdom is a fun game.  The puzzles are challenging. I would love to see a change to the gifts we can give our neighbors . Such as, the lightening, or fireworks, or an ornament for their aquarium. I would also like to see the diamonds we earn to be available, not stuck in a bank, to be paid for.  Limits could be put on it, of course, but the free one here and there only help once in any puzzle sequence.   Overall, though, its a nice game.",
        "I love this game I just wish it was more interactive with the fish in one's tank. Like when you pet them little hearts appear and one can earn happiness points with so many touches. I also wish that one could still earn something for previous tanks. I have no real reason to visit my first and second tank. I don't earn anything for more decorations and it doesn't get dirty and the fish don't get hungry. I feel bad for them, but I focus on my current tanks.",
        "Got a new tablet for Xmas.   Had game on sd card. Wouldn't transfer to new tablet.  Was on level 105.  Have to start all over again! TORTURE lol. Other games I would just stop but not this one.  I love It!  EDIT...STILL LOVE THIS GAME.  Highly reccommend it!  Some levels are SO difficult but still loving this game Oct 9/17.  DEC 2017.  Still adore this game.  Now my husband plays too.  Best game EVER!"

        "Absolutely love this game. The graphics are gorgeous and the beautiful colors are the main attraction. The gameplay is smooth and the system is easy to understand. Only hindrance would be to those that want to sit down and chug through the game. Simply put, you can't, unless you but in game credits. You'll generally be limited to a few puzzles a day or a good puzzle here and there to eat up the occasional time. It's a calm inducing, fun puzzle game with filled with gorgeous hues through and through",
        "I really enjoy the game, but the monetization method behind it sucks the fun out of it: unless you continuously spend money on in-game credits, you are limited to a few puzzles per day. I would gladly buy this game for, say, $5 if it meant I could play however many levels I wanted, whenever I wanted. Otherwise, a great game, very relaxing and therapeutic. Until the monetization method changes: 3 stars rather than 5.",
        "Edit: changed my rating as I've watched the same ad twice now and it won't update my prisms. Can't be the internet connection as the whole ad shows without interruption! Really enjoy the game and the colours and graffixs are great but the ads after every game are super annoying! If I want more credits I'll watch an ad or at most every 3 games to keep the app free.",
        "I absolutely love this game. Completed all the levels for a few months now and am eagerly awaiting new puzzles! It really allows me to relax but challenge my mind at the same time. :D This game is one of the best colour puzzle games so far when compared to other games such as Blendoku and Color Puzzle. The only thing missing is really just not having enough levels to play.",
        "As many have said this game is relaxing, challenging without being frustrating and its graduated colors are very appeasing to the eye. I do wish I could save the 'puzzle' after its complete without having a heart in it. And even though I mainly play as a relaxing passtime the competitor in me wishes for some stats that rank my ability a little more indepth then 'you did better then the world average' ...  All in all this is well worth the download. Thank you Zut!",
        "I love hue is a simple puzzle game that is relaxing and entertaining. Good for helping me to wind down and chill out. As much as people complain about in game currency, the game is free and i cant fault the method of watching a 30 second ad to be able to play 4 more levels of the game. The developers have to make their money one way or another and its not like the game pops up with ads after every level or bombards you with content you absolutely have to pay for. I think this is probably one of the best puzzle game apps on the play store. 5/5 stars for sure"

The game takes you a thrilling adventure, and although the object stays the same I find myself never growing bored. The way that each new character changes the level is just awesome. Each character is well thought out and designed amazingly. If you're looking for a game to pull out in a waiting room, or while you're bored - then give this game a shot. You definitely won't regret it.",
        "It's definitely a fun game. But I cannot figure out where the in app purchases are! I looked everywhere within the app and there is absolutely no place where I can find in app purchases!! But play store says that this game supports in app purchases. So I'm very confused! Can someone please help me out here??",
        "Its awesomr and makes the time go by so quickly. The tiniest problem is that the gas is too little, but thats the point of the game!",
        "This game has so much potential... I started playing and immediately enjoyed it, they've got the game mechanics perfect, everything is easy to get into and the core gameplay is pretty fun. But simple. This usually isn't a problem because game designers usually build complexity ont on top of simple mechanics. Not these guys. The vast majority of jumping platforms, which is all this game is, are incredibly easy to do once you get the hang of it. And that's it. The game doesn't progress at all. It never gets harder. There are some trees and eventually a couple black holes to avoid. Like I mean 3 in the first 100 platforms. Then after platform 100 and something they introduce this drum symbol thing that you can bounce off of. Do they design jumps that implement these bouncy things in a fun and exciting way? Nope. You just go around them. I made it to platform 200 before I finally gave up. This is just lazy game developing.",
        "A great game for relaxing and honing your jetpack skills. It becomes a little boring after a while though, seeing as it's primarily the same activity over and over again. Otherwise perfect =]",
        "Such a great, simple, enjoyable game. I love the visual effects, the art team did a great job. Sound design is great too. I agree that the game is easy once you get a hang of it, but so are games like agario or *cough cough* all of ketchapp *cough cough*  Honestly the devs did excellent, even with ad implementation, all around 10/10 game"

        "It's like this game was made just for me.  I love everything about it.  I hope for future upgrades to keep the game fun and engaging.  The magnet tail needs to be improved a bit, so that the meat doest drag behind.  Also a change of scenery could be cool.",
        "Ads don't work (it always thinks I'm at the 20 day limit) so making any progress in the game is impossible. It's just a grind without any payoff. Really boring.",
        "My only issue right now is I can no longer watch the ads for extras. Every time I try, it just tells me they will refresh in 24 hours.",
        "Fuuuuuuuun! Silly timekiller and a solid game. Ads are not intrusive.",
        "Sometimes there obstacles that I have no choice  but to receive damage the question is what causes less damage like that's not fair. Or when the tank comes. Before it comes it shoots a missle how am I supposed to predict where the missle is going to be at if it gets fired before I can even see the tank. And several other things I would love to point out but I'm sure I can only type so many characters. I genuinely like playing this game a few fixes can make it more enjoyable instead of me getting frusterared. Another small suggestion the magnetic tail is a waste the way it is. Mainly the meat gets dragged around and gets left behind. Maby make it to where with each upgrade it increases the circumference of its pull and actually pulls them to you instead of dragging and leaving behind. Any ways of you would like to hear more ideas let me know. Also I'm just going out on a hunch whoever made this game is not the one fixing it. Game create out creating games and intern or whatever is the one doing the \"pollishing\" to the game and is making it worse. So someone who knows what they are doing needs to be doing the corrections not some dumbass you found down the road if that's the case. Everyone should see the difference in the signature and everyone has a unique signature aka trade mark."

        "This is a very wonderful \"game\" As the concept of this is that its actually a new game every day! This adds so many hours of replay ability do to it being a new game everyday!  Now it's an obvious thought if what would happen to the older games? Yes they're deleted but I think it's only fair due to getting a new one everyday! Wonderful app",
        "Garbage. Making a new game every day just means that every game is horrible. There are enough games put on the play store for you to download one every day, don't stoop to downloading this piece of trash.",
        "The simplicity and endless gameplay just makes me instantly fall in love with this game. Games always eventually get boring, but this one never does!",
        "I've only played one day so I am giving it a 4☆ review bcuz I have yet to see what all is in store for me. I love the graphic style, it's retro with good colors. I look forward to trying more games and revisiting this review in the future. 😎"

        "Well this is a surprise. It does not have much story yet but a good read if you've every played pixel berry's \"choices\" game. Same concept which means choices are going to need diamonds. Meaning you need to pay to do them. I really find it a nice read but since the books are few i'm on hold on purchasing diamonds. I guess once a series is completed i'm willing to buy diamonds to replay that game. For now i'm just browsing the game and taking notes on how many diamonds are going to cost per book.",
        "This game is amazing! The graphic is pretty great, plus the story is super ADDICTIVE. I can't stop reading this story but because of I have no pass left. However the problem is the pass, the pass is too little and the time is pretty long to wait. I hope this app would give much pass and please make the time shorter. But still this game is awesome, I recommend this game for you. You should download this app and try it."

        "Love it. Been playing for over a year. You can earn gems slowly to get premium characters or spend money to get them. However you do not need premium characters to play the game. I think people forget that your \"FREE\" games have to make money some how to pay developers, animators, IT support and more. Either they have dozens of ads everyday (DK has a few but not dozens) or premium paid content.",
        "Most addictive game! Playing it since it 1st started. Love the new mystery event it's so adorable except your missing one vital character!!  I think there's a couple points to improve on... the send home button in the characters actions list I think should be up the top and smaller instead of scrolling down for it cos I use it often. 2nd all of the sounds in my game are very poor, it's nearly always silent and music is always late. Haven't heard the high 5 sound in ages 😔 please fix the sound!",
        "The game is fun and all, but do you think you guys could get this game optimized for the Lenovo tablets? I had to get a new tablet since previous one broke. Now the game keeps closing out on me when I'm trying to do something. Think you guys can fix this somehow?  I'd appreciate it if you do. Thanks in advance.",
        "This game has given me nothing but problems. Every update has to have a glitch. First there was a problem when ever I tried to open a chest. Then an update came and After that update now the consetion stands close out the game anytime I want to view. Now with winnie the poo update the whole dam game is slow. Seriously thinking of quiting. It doesn't matter every update has a glitch. Can't u guys fix it? Or is just me?",
        "This is a fun game. Graphics are so very Disney.  I have a question.. WHAT is the reason for the guests to have a character over their head? That is quite distracting..especially when I don't know what their purpose is.  Also..I wish their leveling up and their quests weren't so long..I only get to play about 5 minutes. But I do love the game",
        "This game is amazing! I love it so much! It just reminds me of my childhood, and of all of the TV shows I used to watch. I have only 1 problem with this game, it does not count time when you go out of the game or close your phone. It might just be me, but if it wasn't for the bad saving, I would have given this game 5 stars, since it deserves it, or even more."

Then I noticed that they changed the looks and now it looks horrible and stupid I was disappointed by this plus to many damn ads! PS unupdate the app the older version was better the new one sucks!!",
        "I like this game and all, but there's to many ads and when I try to click out of the ad it just brings me to the game. There's to many ads also because every time I lose I have to watch a ad which gets frustrating after a while but rather then its a great game."

They should have ways to earn more tickets, and give you at least 5 tickets. Lol ...I thought the characters talked, but they don't. So that'll be a fun if they add that in. I've been play bad boys and I like it.",
        "This game is amazing. I can play and discover many interesting stories. But I have a problem its an issue long ago. It's about connecting to the network because the app in my phone can't connect well to the internet its an error. PLEASE fix it...😣😣😣",
        "Great story's to read.the ones I love to read is Isak &Finn.what can I say I love all stories and some are my favorite ones I just read over and over,like Love is a Drug.p.s I was playing pitch perfect in the deep treble it only let me go up to 18 only and know that I want to play it it takes me back to my favorite.",
        "I think that if u like drama u should get this app. I've always loved this app I always get upset when I loose the ticket thingys cuz I'm at a good part of the story lol 😂 but ya I give it a 5 stars. I LOVE IT 💕",
        "Its great but should include more stories that you get to not only customize your character but also choose your romances, career, Paths. And so much more but overall the app is great",
        "I can't see my full screen! I cannot even see one word our my character in the story! I see one little fragment of the game! This game is a horrible game! I would be nice if I could actully see the game!"
