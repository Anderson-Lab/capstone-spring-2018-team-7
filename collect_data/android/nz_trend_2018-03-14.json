I basically watch each time a purchase is made to see the stars before moving on.  Also agree the game was easier but now is much harder and takes longer to open treasure chest.",
        "Can't create your own tanks,  things just get placed there and you can't move them. The game itself is okay,  but if you take more than two seconds to find a move you want to do,  it starts flashing a move hint,  and not the best move either.  Nothing different to make this game stand out from most match three games.",
        "Only played until level 8. It's an okay game but you can't really decorate your reef. You buy items and they plop down but you can't move them, so they stay where they fell. Not impressed. Used to play Fishdom and it was SO much better. The graphics were better and you could really decorate your tanks by moving items to where you wanted them not where they plopped down. You could also rename your fish. This game is like expecting Oreos and getting generic, chocolate sandwich cookies. Just a cheap imitation. Uninstalling",
        "I would give it a 5 IF it had some instructions.  How do you choose a picture for the character frame?  I choose a house for my tank and it didn't show up.  I checked out all of the icons and couldn't find any help.  I really don't want to delete game but I would like some help, and I see that other players would too.  Thanks.",
        "The game is listed as Everyone, but it is likely up to age 10. Helping fish friends? No, even less than 10. Dont understand why the game occupies 123 Mb of space, that is over the average.",
        "Cute,fun ,but you can't even design your own tank. It would be a much better game if some things were changed in favor of your players. Please let us design our on tank.I"

The letter selection is a pain sometimes too as you can easily select letters on accident.  Also a lot of words missing as being words from puzzles. Otherwise this is quite fun.",
        "While I love the concept behind the game, there are several inconsistencies that both I and the rest of my family have noticed; there have been numerous occasions where a valid word one puzzle is an invalid word the next, not even eligible as a bonus word.  The other issue I've noticed is that some words aren't actually words.  The one that immediately springs to mind is \"elks\", which is the name of a club, not the plural for elk.  So, aside from those two quirks, it's a very good game.  Those quirks, however, do serve to pull one out of the immersion of a good game.",

I havent checked...i hope so . all in all its a good game it just needs a bit of a kick to encourage more players...maybe another type of course and you have to design the car or something ...i dont know you guys are the geniuses not me",

Update few days later...   Suddenly the game keeps crashing randomly...   Tried it for days....   Can hardly survive a single level now...    Very sad....   The game itself is still excellent....   Maybe a later update brings a fix..................",

If I had to have one game on my phone except YouTube this would be my number one game so keep going but one thing you should make lots of more songs like really new songs",
        "It's really REALLY fun and addicting. I absolutely love it. The only thing I don't really like about it is that you only have a certain amount of lives. But other than that, this game is AWESOME and I mean awesome when I say AWESOME. You should totally download it, I really recommend it!!",
        "One of my favourites from cheetah, however, on certain devices the games sound seems to get altered on certain keys making the game very unsatisfying to play. However, on my Samsung the game is a joy, I am using a Sony experia right now so I guess it's only on certain devices, but I feel like the alternative sound should be optional. 9/3/2018 I'm so glad that the game has recently updated and the noise issue has been resolved, the game is as lovable as it was before if not more!",
        "Been playing this game for years and I still love it. New songs are being added regularly and it's easy enough to get gems to unlock them. Ads aren't distracting and micro transactions are limited to those too impatient. Great designs. 10/10",
        "I do like the game but the problem is whenever I do a song and pick the snow powerup, I can't activate it. I always press the icon but it's not working and it's making me fail more. Please put the snow powerup in some place else, and also maybe make it biter for a finger.",
        "Games like this are hard to come by. Not only does the game actually have GOOD ENGLISH (unlike a lot of games) it is also simple, but beautiful. This game makes me feel like I'm actually playing a piano. I love this game, I wish I could give it  more than five stars! But there is one tiny problem, whenever the game goes from one star to two stars and so on, it lags horribly for a few seconds. That's the only problem! 😅"

No complaints... No p2w... and the graphics if you set them to full are just phenomenal!!! Keep it up guys!! But fix the loading issue so we can get back to akademia!!",
        "Great game so far. Not sure if there is a community forum or something somewhere which would be nice. I had a character on some other server and it seemed to be erased when the new server opened? Its fine though, previous character did not have too much progression. Music is not the greatest though, would be good if you could include more classic FF music in the game.   Dailys seem a bit overwhelming. There are so many quests to complete each day to get all the chests.   Other than that im quite enjoying it. If you can't load the game after update clear data and dl again",

I hope this time it won't happen again.   What?? Still having the same error! Please do something about it, since the game is really nice.",
        "I was hooked up playing this game as you can still get stronger without spending. Unfortunately looks like something broke during the update and was stucked in the FF splash screen. Hoping that the devs are on top of this and release an official announcement to players.",

And now the game doesn't even start, i love the final fantasy franchise and you have a really great game, and i like that you have to interact with the game to stay alive and it's not just automatic bullcrap, please keep updating the game."

        "I have downloaded and uninstalled it and did the same process over again and I still can't play it. It keeps telling me that it needs an active internet connection to play. Well, I can play my other internet based mobile games and I am writing this review from the same mobile device and everything else that requires internet is working so it is a fault in the game itself. It's a shame because I really wanted to play this but now I am going to uninstall it and not bother with it again because it is frustrating me. If the issue gets fixed somehow then I may think about playing it.",
        "So I'm changing my review. After the past few updates I have won more special dice!! They lowered the level from extra impossible to meduim on the dice Masters, so it's a tad bit more fair! The only problem need, is the daily challenge is too much for the app to stay open. It force closes due to over processing or something, and I'd rather not have the daily challenge and the game work lol. But definitely gaining more stars each update from me!!",
        "This game is fun but I don't know if it's a bug or they're doing it on purpose but it seems like you can never win the extra challenges they do to win prizes.  I have watched the game say I lost when there's no way the computer opponent could have gotten enough points to be me. I messaged the game creators about it and never got a response. I'm about to uninstall this game.",
        "GAME CODE reveals ROLLS ARE NOT RANDOM - they're pulled from a table of predertirmined outcomes, designed to MILK YOU FOR MONEY at a set rate, based on PvP, reg. Game, Event, Boss, etc.  Just like slot machines & video poker (which i programme).  You must 'assemble' high scoring games, like a puzzle, with majority of yahtzees sitting after 4 or 8 rolls (1 or 7 bonus 'dice'(money) spent)... Like a choose your own adventure book that can cost Hundreds of Dollars.",
        "I love this game but lately it's been frustrating as nothing is loading or working. It won't update anything when I open the app and I've gone as far as deleting and really downloading but it is still giving me issues. I am am very dissapointed as over the last few weeks it has kicked me out of a ton of games for being \"inactive\" when in all reality the games weren't loading and for almost a week the entire app wasn't loading any information.",
        "I'll give this game more than one star once the showdowns are less about the computer clearing and more about real challenge.  Once you start a showdown the computer conveniently never gets a bad roll.  Which wouldn't be a big deal except you have to wait to challenge them again unless you want to pay for extra dice which is used to unlock everything else.  Kinda cheap."

Important parts of all the stories are in video or picture form and you have to sign up with weekly payment, monthly payment, or yearly payments to view any and all pictures and videos.  The cheapest deal is paying 40 dollars a year for an app that has maybe 25 to 30 stories.  And why a subscription?  Completely unprofessional and greedy business decision.",
        "Alot of the elements in the stories are locked behind a payment, so unless the story talks about the image you kind of get left imagining what it is. If there was an option to earn tokens for said details instead of paying, I'd consider giving an extra star.",
        "Gave a 1 star for graphics, which was laughable- you need to pay $40 a year to see any images!! Blocks everything behind a paywall, limits how much you can read, and is overall an awful money grab. Don't even bother.",
        "It was nice, I was ecstatic to read one of the many stories until I got to a video, then it became boring and a bit confusing, because I couldn't play any of the videos so I was completely in the dark about what was going outside of the two characters talking. I know you guys are tryin to make money but that's probably gonna discourage downloaders of this app and make the app a wasteland, just give or take a few years.",

        "Very good game. Something that is an upgrade from Score hero. BUT.  1. The controls -The range u can pass in is very limited and would be better if we could ass anywhere we want. Also, if there was a power bar for how fast we want the ball to go or a ground pass or cross etc.  2. AI - Sometimes they would go for a tackle and completely miss the player or ball. Also, They run so aimlessly and quite annoying. Please fix this so that this game is more enjoyable.  I feel like much is to be improved but this game has potential",
        "Amazingly evocative and addictive football game – up to level 4. After that it gets REALLY frustrating. Your own team AI suddenly seems gimped, with players making bizarre mistakes, and you get constantly matched against opponents with much better players than you. Makes the game feel much more about luck than skill. Could be so good if it felt more fair. One thing that would make it better is the ability to choose a hard, medium, or easy match; the harder the match, the bigger the bux payout. Would make it much less stressful to play.",
        "Scripted sorry excuse for a football game with retarded players where the entire point of the game is upgrading your team but player levels doesn't matter because they have never even heard what football is.  If, however, you decide to download this game, unlock the 10-0-0 formation as soon as possible because your team will not play defense anyways. Doesn't make a difference if you play 5-3-2 with level 10 players or 0-0-10 with level 1 'players' , your team will still play like a bunch of retards.",
        "So my winger finally makes a run down the wing and puts in a cross. The ball falls to my striker at the edge of the box. He has a clear sight on goal.... what happens next?  Well the game forces me to pass the ball to my wing back all the way back near the halfway line.  I've always played the Score series but this games makes me wanna break my phone. Serious revamp is needed in the gameplay. And don't even get me started on the stupid tackling.",
        "What I dislike: Poor Game! It needs improvements, modifications and changes... I'll think of reinstalling it when I realise that their are chances the gameplay would change because I see that we are not free to move our players, you should change the way the defence is and let it be by swiping, same for goal keeping...  What I like: I like that my country exists in the game, I hope that you add it to \"Dream League Soccer 2018\" 's custom player, I'll be willing to sell the player and buy him again just to adjust the country...",
        "Very luck based. I've lost games without hardly touching the ball and not even being able to get to try to tackle. They may tackle when there not even near players. And if you win the ball from a tackle, at least half the time you don't keep the ball. SORT OUT TACKLING!"

        "This truly is one of the best simulation games I have played and ×what makes even better is you can play and not be forced to spend real money. I love this. It's a great time killer , you can get creative. Just o.e small issue is when trying to relocate any building or decorations it's hard to control that part. But it's AWESOME",
        "This game is good but got it through Sony's store an i got an older version. When i came here to update and rate it an i discovered i had to install it again. Now i got 2 games both linked to Facebook but no way to continue the old game data on the new one. Oh with surprise its not even on gamelofts sit. Please help",
        "I love this game and would like to keep playing. But since the update I couldn't get into my stadium, the game would crash. Now, it won't even open. I even uninstalled it then reinstalled it, but it won't even open. It's just a black screen then back to my home screen. So, I loved it, but I can't even play it, so I guess I have to delete it :'/",
        "For some reason the game has been force closing after every ad I watch I watch an ad to rush 5 mins and it force closes after the ad plays and doesn't give the 5 mins off. Please fix this I have paid money toward this game and I watch ads to help also thank again for making the best city building game ever. 5 stars will be back when I can watch an ad without force close. I play on galaxy s7 edge    Loving this game it gives you a huge island with all kinds of different terrain to expand your city and also has plenty of ways to rush things by watching optional ads it's very rewarding and there are mini games to entertain and reward you  I've only had this game a few days now but It is so much better than sim city build it that I don't even play sim city anymore good job Gameloft can't wait for future updates.",
        "It's pretty cool. Definitely has a little challenge at beginning having to wait for the resources to be made for everything. I'm gonna play it for awhile to see if gets better. Graphics are alright but game control is little touchy when placing new buildings.",
        "Well I was really enjoying the game until it was time to expand my storage (in lvl 7). The arrow pointing to the storage button with the guy on the left saying this one's free and I can't click on anything. Like it's frozen, but not frozen because things still get highlighted when going by them. What's the problem here?! Restarted my phone, cleared junk and other apps, ???"

The 5 free hints is unrecoverable like other puzzle games that I played! Also sometimes the games shows some ads, even worst player are force to watch ads just to unlock certain levels! Do yoy what more garbage is? The puzzle dont make a senses, with limited once 5 free hints, every each puzzles  are pretty stupid as they are not logical (even you want make a troll still need to make its logic like other puzzle games).",
        "Just another pointless stupid game. It has no instructions and then glitched and if I watch ads I still get no free hints. It won't go any further than the girl on the cliff",
        "Entertaining! Ads are as always quite annoying unfortunately: got stuck a lot (somehow) and had to spend ages watching videos just to get some hints. Generally though, nice little game! I loved the references to some of the games! ;)",
        "It won't let me get past the part with the girl on the cliff and trophy thingy. It won't let me click on her neck or do anything and it's frustrating. I hate it",
        "I have a question how in the hell do you play this game? there is no tutorial. there are no instructions there's nothing but watching videos for free hints on what you're supposed to do in each level. I would like to actually play the game without having to watch the videos the whole time. Do not install!!!",
        "This game is not for narrowminded people who can't think outside the box or see past their noses. Its a different kind of game. A fun game. The whole point is to figure out how to past the levels without the help of hints. The answers are not impossible, just different. There are no instructions because that would defeat the purpose of playing. Instructions would basically give you the answer without you having to think for yourself. I commend the creator and developers for keeping things different instead of making another common and usual game like Word Find. If you're disliking the game then go play scrabble, word find, match 3 or combat whatever, etc."

The pictures showing the terrains is probably copied off of MCPE's pictures (I am not saying it is! But it might be). I really like this game I really do but there needs to be some changes. People aren't going to like this game if there isn't some changes. I just read a comment saying this game is \"gay\". That was incredibly rude. People shouldn't call it \"dumb\" or \"gay\" just because this game needs better graphics or it has to many ads. Does anyone even know the definition of \"gay\"? There is two meanings for it but they both mean your happy! Stop calling the game names! It is not necessary to!",

Sure, they bring new things that are different from Piano Tiles, but it's done terribly. The one thing I saw different was the bar at the bottom and getting the actual score, but after more playing, I realised that the bar was just there so they could sync up the music with when the blocks would come to the bar. They didn't even at least sync up the music to when you hit the black boxes, I experimented. All in all the game is terrible because of my own experiences and things they didn't do very correctly.",

        "This game has potential, don't ruined it because of money. I have never been watching so many ads In my life just to get some 2 stars parts. Instead of being creative and making cool machines, this game is turning to - either pay to win or watch alot of ads to win. What's the point of \"playing\" in this game?",
        "I love this game. Been playing since almost the beginning. Idk how I feel about the ultimate league but it's not bad. I'm digging the concept of the kings part of the gang fights. I'd really like it if you guys could have it show who's online in your gang like it does in the championship lobby. Oh and notifications for your gang chat would be great. I'm seeing comments about the game crashing, and heard issues my gang has had also. Hopefully that's taken care of soon. It would be nice to hear back on this comment to know we're being heard. Thanks",
        "Cute, simple, fun to compete. Strong presence of Pay-2-Win when Tier-1 players are 1-shotting you. Can advance timers by watching ads so use wifi often. **Dropped a star because I can't do this anymore; it's only asking for gems now**. Clubs (gangs) only hold 25 people and cost 100 gems to start. Need Bolts to upgrade, chests to get them, 2h-6h to unlock or watch 2-12 ads (not anymore for me?) So grind while playing games or watching movies.",
        "I very much enjoy this game because it is a lot of fun and us very exiting to play. Not only are you able to fight different people online, but you also get to customise you're vehicle. And you get to chose what your character's outfit looks like.",
        "I truly love this game and would give it five stars...if only it would give me items that are in my tier, get to tier four finally get tier one weapons of the same class. I like a challenge but this is absurd stupidly absurd",
        "Game was fun. Then I started hitting the wall where you couldn't progress unless you paid more money. Then this most recent patch introduced a bunch of bugs that kept losing parts and golden tix. Then their support was unresponsive. Not fun anymore."

        "Fun game. Good graphics, and overall good fishing simulator. However, its ridiculously rigged. I can only win 1 out of 4 rounds in 1v1, cause unless I get lucky, my opponents always get humongous fish, while I have highly upgraded lures with all boosters active yet I catch tiny ones. The game is addictive but the rigged aspect needs to be fixed so there's a fair chance for everyone to succeed.",
        "OUT OF ALL THE FISHING GAMES THAT ARE ON THE APP STORE I'VE FOUND ONLY 3 WORTH PLAYING,AND THIS MY FRIENDS IS ONE OF THEM!!!!!!! IT'S A MUST DOWNLOAD AND TRY FISHING GAME/APP!! GREAT GRAPHICS, AND DESIGN!!! IF YOU DON'T DOWNLOAD THIS FISHING GAME/APP THEN YOU ARE MISSY OUT ON A FANTASTIC DAY OF FISHING!!!!  SO STOP READING AND GET TO DOWNLOADING THIS APP, AND GET TO ALL THE INCREASABLE FISHING FUN!!!!!!😎😋🤣😄😅😁😂🤗😜😛😌😳😱😰",
        "i NEVER got my 3x gold pack for completing the legendary championship challenge that i worked so hard to get(required 500pts, i had 550pts. And they said i can catch the legendary shark with just a basic lure, well i was grinding at it like 8hrs a day and not even once. And my lure is fully upgraded and using PRO gear. SCAM!!! All that work 4nothing.",
        "Crashes/freezes way too much to be worth my time. Oh, and be prepared to pour money into this game. Opponent \"magically\" catches a monster fish with 2 seconds left in every 1 on 1 match and wins. Lost 13 straight matches like this. A complete scam and money pit.",
        "Everything is pretty amazing tbh. But still some bugs that annoys me. Like this morning came 4th in championship but when silver pack was on its way my screen just went blue and nothing more happened.. Closed app restarted yet nothing.. And I mean ppl pay for buffs.so yeah I got ripped off. But overall amazing.",
        "At the start you can play for about 1-2hrs; Then you have to wait for 8 more hours because you can't upgrade anything, or earn anything. From then on it's more of a chore then anything fun. The game starts out confusingly so lots will spend the free in game currency they give you, that you desperately need to speed up pack openings! Then before you even know how the game progresses they ask for a review, and reward the player for giving a 4 or 5 star rating(these are the only options). Not very admirable practice in my opinion! They have a solid foundation of a good \"FTP\" game; But seems like they are more interested in making money then developing a desirable gaming experience."

It's pretty entertaining, it isn't very time consuming, and I'd say it's at least worth a try. Thanks for reading",

        "Over All I love the game! Very addicting and good time passer! I am currently in Chapter 19 of Love Mona Study Abroad and the whole series is very good. My only problems with the app are that we should get more dimonds and tickets. I think it would be nice if we could watch adds for 2 free dimonds or tickets or something like that. And I really really hope this part of my review is read because this would definitely make this app a lot better if they made more books to the Love Mona/Dear Mona series! I planned on deleting the app after I finish the series because I didn't really find any of the other books to seem very appealing, but if they plan to make more to the series I will definitely keep it!",
        "I've only read 1 story so far. The story itself wasn't bad. Slowly working through another. The characters are kind of goofy looking but I like the app. You're able to earn gems as you go. It does give you only 1 ticket at a time, per hr. But it also gives you the option to watch videos to speed up the clock so you can get it sooner. Which NONE of the other apps like this do! There is something about the videos I don't like though... After you watch them, it automatically brings you to the app store to download whatever game you just watched the video for. Sooooo annoying! Otherwise, not a bad game thus far. It is a great time waster!",
        "I can't really say how I like this game. It crashed near the beginning. I won't uninstall yet, but I do have two gripes. The Me character is too skinny. Its irritating. And some of the animations look a bit creepy. I mean why is what's his face jumping around every time he talks?",
        "I think the wait for tickets to read the next chapter is not the best idea. You loose interest in the story. I used to be apart of episode and you didn't have to deal with the wait time to read the next chapter.  The only time you had to wait was when the author didn't write the next chapter.  I think I might go back to episodes this wait is crazy and then they want you to buy these tickets.   Other than that I like the story. The characters mouths look funny.",
        "I love the game, it has such neat story lnes and wonderful graphics! I wish that it would give you more tickets than 1, more like 2 or 3, like they have a timer rate snd keep regenerating. But other than that, the game is awesome! Cannot stop playing!",
        "This app is okay. The story is very slow going because you have to wait an hour between chapters and then sometimes it doesn't always work. Also, unless you are willing to pay for diamonds, then you really don't have much of a choice when you are given options. When you are given choices, they usually cost 25 diamonds. But you only get 1 diamond at the end of each chapter. Something's gotta give. Considering deleting app after finishing current story."

        "Unfortunately the game is really UGLY! The concept was good, the individual wood blocks are nice and minimalistic but then the developers pasted giant horrendous comic sans-ish fonts all over and we now have a game that needs a paper bag on its head. The gameplay also ends far too abruptly, no chance to assess your final screen and see your errors. Just so very ugly... I mean aesthetically displeasing.",

        "It's sad to see people complaining and giving bad reviews about crashing but not knowing it's probably because their device is  g a r b a g e. I have j3 6 which is pretty bad and still runs well. Very optimized, sleek game. Also alot of updated to keep the game fresh and the microtransactions are very fair.",
        "Very fun game, wish it wasn't energy based, would definitely enjoy it more. The fishing is 'new' right now and i have to say the percentages are garbage. 75 percent is more like 50, 50 percent is like 10 percent,  25 percent is closer to 50. This is just my personal experience. The games is really fun though, expect to get annoyed with the fishing percentages however. Also energy gets spent super fast in this game, very fun yet very limited.",
        "I fell in love with this game as soon as I opened it the first time. But there is a problem which forces me to give it a 2 star rating. It kicks me out of the game every 5 minutes and that way I can't get any progress done. I absolutely enjoyed the little playtime I got and I want to play it more but it won't let me. Great job otherwise devs!",
        "Fun and amazing game, great time killer for me, I just love these pixelated games so much.. to be fair it sounds like it's more Terraria and pokemon mixed typa thing y'know.. 5 stars",
        "Been playing this for about a week.  It's a lot of fun with a variety of different things to do.  Running out of energy for doing dungeons doesn't matter a lot as there are three or four other things to do in game that don't require energy.  Will be making a purchase to support the devs.  Good game!",
        "The one and only terrible thing in this game is the energy system. The fact that you need to wait for half a day for the energy bar or to recharge is just way too much...  I would suggest having the quest to cost half the current energy.  The rest is okay to me"

        "This app is amazing! I wanna see it improved though.. I've noticed it only works for mp3 files. I'd like to see a couple things. A remove ads button, maybe a way to play it from any music, such as Spotify and maybe Pandora or other services like YouTube? Cause I don't use mp3s but I'm using it for this game, and it works, but the amount of ads... Please make a remove ads button! I'll pay for it for sure!",
        "Love the game and would give it a 5 star but would there be any chance to remove the blur effect or have an option to toggle. It makes it very difficult to focus when you're playing a fast tempo song. Also a sound when you collect or maybe  a very slight vibrate would t go a miss. Keep up the good work.",
        "Congratulations to the dev for making a game similar to Audiosurf for mobile! It is a really good concept, but still needs some work. The camera is sometimes looking down at the road and it refuses to cooperate that way. The visuals are so powerful that you can't fully understand what's going on in front of you sometimes. I would suggest improving the speed of the vehicle, and the first map should have the road a bit smoother, because it simply gets you confused. EDIT: After being updated, the game is getting better and better, which I really respect. New vehicles, new maps and a better gameplay experience. Some bugs removed and added some rebalances to the game, so it is more enjoyable.",
        "Music racer is something simple. Yet pure. It gives the aesthetic art style of a 90's vaporwave ride with a  plethora of amazing eye candy visuals. To the space screen reflections, to the particle density and glow of the saturation. Uniquely crafted to keep you hooked into this simulation. The gameplay is really amazing. It's nothing new. Of course. But it's there. When you want a game that place to your music. This is it. You go in, and choose a song from your mp3 list, and go. You get loaded into one of three visually amazing tracks that you begin to speed way through. The pace goes faster, or slower, dependant on the songs bpm or DB levels. Given that I usually criticize a lot of games for the slightest bit of things. You'd be surprised that I'd give this game four to five stars. Because it does what it is said to do.",
        "I usually don't rate games but this blends gaming and music almost seamlessly. I've been telling a lot of people to download it cause it's definitely worth it. I advise you to play the game while listening to something heavy drops or ones that give you chills. I'd 100% pay for this but luckily it's free.",
        "Can't say enough about it. My ONLY issue with it is the ads. If you offered a paid version or a pay to remove ads, and it was reasonable, I would do it without hesitation. And everybody, do yourself a favor and use some music by Hyper Potions in this game. Best thing ever."

        "I love this game and would have rated it a 5 but suddenly the pause feature isn't working and I lost a game that was over 8000 points because I had a phone call. After I unpaused it set me back to zero. So aggravating. Also the 30 second ad for 30 stars doesn't show up anymore. Not sure what happened to this game in the last 2 weeks.",
        "Good concept. Too bad the ads ruin the calibration. Either the ad loads and is in the way or it doesn't load and shifts the page. This second issue is the worst of the two. This completely ruins the calibration and forces you to touch above or below the tile you want to remove. Often times leading you to remove tiles you don't want to",
        "Sadly, it could've been a fun game if I could actually tap where I wanted to. The tap is off by like a few mm or something. I have to tap above the try again button to actually try again, or else I end up hitting challenges... So during the game play the exact same thing would happen, which makes the game unplayable.",
        "There are way too many advertisements every time I start a game or lose or win a game I instantly get an 30 second ad which I have to waste my time on to skip it until I am finally done. Overall except for the advertisements it is a great game controls and game play is brilliant I recommend this game but you will get a lot of ads. Suggestion: Lower the amount of ads showen",
        "Nice concept, but like others have said the tapping is off. You have to tap half a cm above the block you want to pop. No wonder you advertise \"Only 1% of players make it to 10,000!\"",
        "This game is a great time killer! It is really addictive and fun but almost every time you die you have to sit through an ad which gets annoying. Overall this is a good game bit watch out for ads."

        "this game is good till about 8 hours in where your waiting days to build anything. Gems are really hard to come by so you have to be wary about how much stock u have. And there's no way to dispose of unwanted items in your warehouse (that I know of) but yeah, it's a catchy game",
        "I liked this game, and have played it for months, until a few days ago when I noticed the \"price\" of buildings required to progress take a huge jump up!! I will gladly support a game I like by making purchases but I'm not about to spend my house payment just to progress IN A GAME!! Not cool, and makes me regret the money Ive spent so far. On to the next!!",
        "Super easy to run out of storage, then when you try to sell nobody wants to buy anything even if you price it 75% off total price because they're full too. It would be nice to be able to delete items you can't sell, don't want, or can't use. Really want love the game.",
        "It's quite annoying that you have to wait so long for all the buildings. Days. And fighting the trolls. Again, days. And that it is so hard to get the flame amulets that you need in order to make progress. It saps all the fun out of the game.",
        "I gave a name to my village but after logging in through fb i get only my fb name displayed. I wanted the initial farm name only to be displayed. At first the game was fun.. but now time taken is too much for each task to be complete which is frustating"

Just play the middle room level if you want good and real human opponents without the computer pawn cheat. By the way 6 continous perpetual check is draw on this chess game rule. So beware of that.

        "There are some people botting and hacking in PvP matches. Their heroes are able to shoot consistent trajectory with pinpoint accuracy within 1 second of determination every round. I understand that some players may be really good, but the consistency and super fast determination is more computer-like than human. They behave like the NPC in adventure stages. I suggest monitoring top 100 ranked PvP players closely for botting and hacking.  I still enjoy the game overall and look forward to improvements.",

I spent money on this game and do not want to lose what I had. Why did it do this? Please fix my problem",

Far too often, there isn't enough of the item on the board you're trying to collect (need 40 vases, but there's less than 30 available).  Board is cluttered and can be hard to see.

I tried deleting the game and reinstalling it, still I can't get my game level back.  I have contacted technical support and still no reply. Up until this point, it was a great game and I liked it very much. Is there anything that can be done to get my game back",

        "Pretty good response to a problem I had with the game dropping the internet frequently.  Didn't completely resolve the issue but at least the game is enjoyable to play.  I found that if I kept my betting moderate I could easily win enough to play comfortably.     Great graphics and bonus games, free spins and such.  Some of the slots seemed to pay a little better and others had better \"extra games\".  I really enjoy the variety of ways each game plays as I move through the levels.  Overall a great slots game with a little bit of wildlife education thrown in.",
        "Be careful not to get tempted to spend any of your hard earned money thinking that you can really do some good. The very opposite happens, you only buy time nothing else and when your bought coin upgrade runs out, Murka are the only winners. You would better off putting you money into an online casino for real money, at least you have a chane to wwin some real cash. And these are regulated to prevent theft.",
        "At first win some lose some back n forth now it's lose to broke in hopes you buy. They must of turned it up. Having 100K winning 250 and only having 100 afterwards, umm where did that go? I didn't receive credit on the win and you want me to buy? Isn't that kinda stealing, oh wait it IS!!!",
        "Too early to review properly. Will come back and edit later. 49 consecutive days later having had as much as 4 billion I now have nothing. Typical Murka sucking you in then bleeding you dry. Good game while it lasted. Time to uninstall cos I ain't spending real money.",
        "Great graphics and easy gameplay on mobile. Payouts are pretty good and surprising big wins. The only thing I would change is make more rooms available at a lower level. I've been playing for about 3 months and only at level 58. Seven rooms down can't wait to see the rest",
        "I think the min bet needs to be lower cause when you get to higher levels you only get like 2 spins then out of money again.  I guess I'm not lucky. I love the game just give us more coins to play with."

I was skeptical of how I was going to like it at first but it proved me wrong and I immediately took to it. The controls are easy to learn and I don't even mind all of the ads. Honestly, a really great game.",
        "It's really Fantastic BUT I didn't give 5 stars because 1.spa part is damaged it makes the game freeze 2.I don't like the mascaras they're not natural 3. Why the character is very pathetic,insecure and not confident. She must be a more confident girl when interacting with others. Please consider these problems.. I'm looking forward to playing the next sequel. Thanks a lot",

I have brought this up in the past fix this issue the game is fun.",
        "This is a fantastic game. Free to play is completely viable and you actually have a chance to compete with those who pay. Has a few bugs here and there like hulk getting frozen or Hawkeye freezing the game but the devs are actively working on it. Worth the download, no question.",
        "The game only loads until 42 percent for me. And it started right as I was a day or so away from unlocking the 30 day login reward. They changed the login rewards as Well and made them worse for players. I hope they fix this game, Ill give it another day and I'll uninstall it.",
        "Game is looking really good so far the toon animations are awesome and the devs seem to be working hard to fix the bugs. There is a couple of problem in the guilds atm that really needs fixxed anyone can start the raids this results is people wasting points when the info says only officers and leaders can start raids (as it should be) also there is alot off guys guild hopping and farming guild raids with tag ons there needs to be a cooldown period added!!",

        "To be honest I love your music games. I been into it after know about Cytus then Deemo. I been looking forward for more game from Rayark and you come out with Cytus II. Overall the graphic and song perfect,but then I realize the gameplay slightly different the touch more sensitive then the first one. I don't mind pay for the song,but I hope the gameplay would be much better in future. Looking forward to see different platform game from Rayark!",
        "The game itself is amazing don't get me wrong, but everytime I play it it just completely wrecks my game performance because of the effects, espescially long slide chain. So I have a request to please add in the function of disabling effects. That would improve the gaming performance on a lower-end phone way more. That aside, this game is pretty much perfect. Really catchy songs and quite a intuitive gameplay. Nice job Rayark!",
        "One word: ASTONISHING!!!  The game is perfectly built but there are flaws also...    1. The app can't be moved into External Storage.  2. The gameplay slighly drops fps especially on the hold note. Much better if there is a gfx settings from low to high or  maybe optimize the game even further.  3. The phone heats up real quick.  4. The hit sounds won't work sometimes like every 4 taps or more then the hit sound wont work then 4 taps again vice versa. That's all I can say for now. Great job on the 2nd Cytus.",
        "Rip its like $16 for a specific genre / character. I want to play cytus classical music. I know creating games aren't free. But I wish cytus 2 could be play to unlock later on (or unlock at least one genre from playing). Also wondering if cytus 2 will work on keeping the heat the same or lower? (I like rayark games btw keep up the good work:)",
        "Nice game overall. Well, it's from Rayark, afterall. But, isn't the price for 1 character a bit too high? I've spent money on other Rayark games so I don't mind spending money on games. I know there's cost and needs actual effort to make songs and it's completely fine for people to pay for it but maybe, just maybe, the price is too high for the new characters/genres. Still, this is a good game. Maybe give a demo or preview for some of the songs from the locked characters at a certain time so I know what type of songs I'll be paying for.",
        "Absolutely amazing, really great game, definitely a great addition to the legacy of Rayark's rhythm games.  Gameplay is solid, reminiscent of old Cytus with some new elements added here and there. The story is much more immersive, with multiple characters as opposed to Deemo's progression with one main character.  One tiny comment though: the colours are absolutely impossible to distinguish when the bar is going up and down for colourblind me. It was easier in old Cytus with the white background, but I feel that the colours don't stand out enough against the black canvas here."

If I had a complaint it's the unnecessary intro and exit to each game, I don't need to see birds fly across field or see bracket switch,  just get to game play. Really great concept of a word game though, Thanks!",
        "Love this game and would have given 5 stars, but been playing for couple of weeks and now it won't work.  Tried reinstalling, but did not help.  It tries to load then just disappears!  I also did the latest update, again, no help",
        "Was playing it with no problems.  All of a sudden it started shutting down on me every time I opened it.  Even after the 1/28/18 update, it is still happening.  This app is unstable.  I love the game but am getting tired of playing a game that hasn't been properly tested before being released.",
        "Love this game, bought a couple rounds of gems and now it crashes every time I open it. It is driving me nuts. I invited friends to play and can't even play against them. Please fix this otherwise I wasted money on gems to get extra tiles needed for words to help me win games to advance in games and now I am going to end up having to delete this game. What a waste.  .",
        "I love playing this game. I've been play for a month now but all of a sudden it's shutting down. Can't play more. Did this problem please, hate to have to uninstall it.",
        "Review for freeplay. Fun game but the ads are awful to deal with. You can't skip most of them so it's bad if you aren't on wifi. The 'reward' for watching an ad is two coins, and as the other reviews mention, there is nothing you can do with them. There's some game lag when advancing to the next round. Still playing but hoping for some improvements."

I was really hoping for a solitaire game I hadn't played before. I'm extremely disappointed. I'm a HUGE fan of your regular solitaire game. Huge fan. But the name and description are misleading and it's embarrassing.",

        "Hi COC. I love this game. This my only favourite game. And its the best in the world. I love when there are updated in the game. But I have a query this time. After Builder Hall 8 update whenever I click by boat to go Builder Base the game shuts. I am not able to upgrade my Builder hall. SUPERCELL you are super we know plz fix this issue and let me know. Plz reply to my review. And give interesting offers on normal base. There are no good offers now. I am very happy to be a memner of COC family. ~King SB  Clan~Ganking Geckos",
        "This is a perfect game..but you should give us a short way to make our town hall level 11.. You should give some event everyday.. make tournament.. what you have give us that is like a league not a tournament... Give a tournament Like football world cup.. first there will be group stage.. knock out stage .. that will make this game so much Enjoyable and more and more interesting.. This is a request to you #SUPERCELL PLZ MAKE THIS HAPPEN..THIS WILL MAKE THIS GAME A DREAM GAME.. MAKE IT HAPPEN SUPERCELL.. LOVE YOU",
        "HI SUPERCELL . some players ruined the clan because of Clan Games. Why? They will join ur clan and check if we already achieve the reward like book. They will earn 50 or 100 points and leave the clan. Pls do something about this issue. The CG rules should change like They will get the reward depend of how many points they earnd. Sample: 1500 points they get the reward from tier 1-3 even though the clan achieved the last tier. Pls fix it. Thanks",
        "If you deploy a troop that hasn't got a primary target never, and I mean never, does cover the least space possible. It always goes with those weird angles for just an easy target. Just go straight forward.. Cover a line, we don't need unnecessary last moment turns. I play this game since 2013 with different accounts but this thing stays the same. Plz fix it",
        "It was a wonderful game . Thank u SUPERCELL ,for giving us a wonderful game. This game graphics was awesome. But I have a complaint against u. That is : if you update this game's features , from where can we get memory. We don't have that much memory in our phones.        Just joking....... Your updates were also awesome. Hope u provide us many games like this coc"

        "The game pretty much plays by itself. You enter into a level and it's a one time boss fight and so far that is all there is to it. As far as customization goes you can only equip ruins. I don't think there's an option to change weapon or armor. Lots to read in the tutorial, the lack of voice overs doesn't really bother me. Graphics are good and you can unlock some pretty good main characters, more at level 4. If this was an open world with full customization it would have a been an amazing game. Overall, it's not the worst game on the market!",
        "Good looking game ruined by slow combat.   You have 4 team members in the beginning, each with 3 abilities. But only one ability can be used, and everyone has to wait 5-6 second global cool down to be able to use a next skill. Global CD on top of the native cool down is not fun. Each battle becomes just an auto attack for 2 minutes, and takes strategy straight out the window.",
        "The graphics are amazing in the art style is definitely unique. More on the adult darker side. My only complaint is that summoning new monsters to use seems to be pretty hard to do. The summoning stones are hard to come by. And there is no free timed daily summon. It makes it hard to feel like there is progression when you are using the same four Monsters the entire game. Other than that it is fantastic. Spot on.",
        "This game's flashy graphics and sounds can't hide the fact that it's just another auto RPG that plays itself. And not a very good one at that. The skill system only allows you to use one skill between your entire party before entering into cool down. Even if you can reduce the cool down time, that's not a very good system. I really wanted this game to be good, but it's very disappointing.",
        "The art and visual effects are where this game really shines. The mechanics of the game, however, have been done before. Rewarding players with more gold and increasing summon rates would make this a lot more enjoyable.  This is a very mediocre launch for what looks to be a promising game. I will be holding out for a little while longer to see if there will be a launch event.",
        "The graphics are great and despite being another rpg that mostly plays itself, I think it's a great game. I like the way the game has ben set up and the story is interesting. However I am confused about some of the character options, for instance, I have a MOV and it has a little crown next to it, and it says 'set as main'. What does this mean? If answered, my review will go up."

        "Great idea. Resources come way to slow. Would be better if I could choose what buildings to build and if the game had more choices and customization to be made. Current game play is all luck. I can't confirm but I am pretty sure dice are rigged. Also do not waste gems on upgrading your police station. You only get one use out of extra officer. Grab the extra officers when you upgrade your city. The are much more useful than the upgrading your piggy bank.",
        "After playing now for a while, I really like the game, but cost way too much to be able to really play and advance, only given 4 free rolls an hour, cannot do anything with that, rolls should be free. I have spent a lot of money buying gems so I could buy rolls in order to really play the game. I think it is unfair to your customers. Should be set up better for people to be able to enjoy the game without costing a small fortune.",
        "You're stealing money from our board! I have 2 accounts, one facebook and one gmail. I am playing with my gmail account when I got 86k+ from my facebook account because i landed on steal. Upon checking my facebook account, 127k+ was stolen from me. There is such a huge difference from the money. We spent gems to buy rolls for the upgrade yet you're stealing our money. Explain. I have screen shot on my facebook account notification on 127k deducted to my account. Too bad i didn't take one on the 86k because i didn't think that this will happen.",
        "I'm having 2 problems with the game. 1: whenever my bunnies have rolls to give me, and I tap to get them, I don't actually receive them. They vanish. 2: When im visiting someone else's board, the game crashes and I lose everything I got into that board such as money, conquered buildings and gems.  It's driving me crazy. Also, I would like for the rolls to recharge every 30 minutes, 1 hour is too much time. I love this game, so addictive.",
        "Update: Most bugs are fixed, my previous issue had been fixed and I'm very thankful for that. I have so much fun playing this game with my friends and have no problem spending money on in game purchases. The only issue right now is that I'm getting kicked out of the game due to connection issues.",
        "I bought a deal in the shop and got extra coins as a prize since my coins spiked to around 1million. Never got a notice saying i got these coins i just happened to notice and was like what the heck, is this a glitch? Then realized it was probably the prize i could get with purchase. 800k was then stolen before i had a chance to use them. We are talking the window of 20sec or less without ever logging off. So I spent actual money on this game and didn't get to use the stuff i spent money on. Poor design that you can have something you paid for stolen within seconds of the purchase."

        "Id just like to say to all of the teams of devs and giant companys that hire psycologists to help them design games... Do what this guy is doing if you want to make a good game. Its addicting and fun for all age ranges.  Im 40yo and have three boys 12 13 and 14 and we all love it. My wife even installed it earlier today to see what the fuss was about and 4 hours later she's still playing. Without a doubt my fav game on android devices.",
        "Just an update to anyone thinking about buying it: looks like the dev has abandoned the game. There hasn't been an update in a very long time. It's sort of finished but could have a lot of tweaks.  This is a great Elona Shooter clone, but has much more depth. I really like this game and recommend if you like incremental games. It's also offline, but has cloud saving with google+",
        "It's very cool. Aesthetics are perfect. Themes are great. The dungeon itself can be boring. I've played for a couple hours now, and it doesn't seem like I have to do anything to win; the other mercenaries handle it on their own. The menus are overehelming for a beginner. There's too much to see and interact with. It takes some time to understand the Research and Rebirth points. Those need a tutorial",
        "I truly love this. It's completely old school through and through, which in this case is perfect. I love that the execution is simple, but there is a HUGE amount of choices you can make that will either give your team the edge or hold it back. There are IAP's but you wouldn't know it unless you went looking for them (big plus there). I definitely think this game is worth ig.",
        "This is a brilliant game. As a game design it is perfect to whittle away a long journey. It is easy to pick up and play, there is lots of research to do. The only thing I would say that needs improvement is the pay for features. I understand there is the need to ask for money to help with further development but to restrict some features to be able to only be played in hell mode seems a bit harsh and excludes the casual player from quite a bit of content.",
        "This is a fantastic game for the price and I have enjoyed every minute of it except for the cost to unlock some features of the game. The amount of grinding can be kind of high as well as the cash price if the grind is too unbearable. This is still a lot better than other games though, which is why I rated this to a 5 star after my last review of 4 stars."

        "While it's not the most graphically Advanced game the game play is so addictive it reminds me of falling into games like old school RuneScape. The in-game currency is plentiful and can be earned fast enough that you don't need to spend real money. The replay value is extremely high as the core mechanic of the game is loot whoring. Essentially take a side-scrolling beat-em-up and add the mechanics of Diablo or Borderlands. 10 out of 10 would enjoy it with rice and I would recommend it to friends.",
        "Great and amazing game. Just please add other ways to get GEMS, like when repeating another level, players can earn 1 GEM would really help a lot. And,I would like to ask when will the next update be available plus a new hero please. Thanks a lot! More power!",
        "It isn't a bad game, I guess it's time consuming but I just couldn't seem to get into it.. The tutorial carried on a little to long and it takes so long to build up a good amount of coins to get anything..",
        "I love the art style of this game and the controls are super easy. The in game currency and \"premium\" currency are easily obtainable so as not to be forced to pay but not overly easy to obtain. I will be playing this game for many many moons to come.",
        "Only special attack are great in this game.the graphics are good but it could be more realistic and the gameplay it's not that I was expecting.the game can be awesome if you guys can improve more in gameplay and a little in graphic.",
        "What's the point of buying an in-app purchase game? A developer sells good game experience, not pain+relief. Sorry for this game, better go free version."

If you love challenges, adventures, and games, you are at the best place you could possibly be. We promise to take you on an unending adventure with new challenges, new stories, and a brand new game every day.In life, you encounter a lot of problems. Problems with studies, problems with exams, problems with relationships, problems of finance and what not. And just when you think you have a solution to a particular problem, Life throws at you a brand new problem.Well, solving problems of life isn't much fun but cracking games can be. And you know it. Especially when it comes to challenging your friends and beating them at it. Ever imagined yourself living a different life every single day. One day you are a politician, on another day you are a doctor, on some other day you are a businessman, one day you are an engineer. Okay! Let's leave the engineers out of it. Sorry once again! Wouldn't the surprise element in the aforementioned cases be amazing?Wouldn't you just look forward to waking up from your bed every single day to try to find out what awaits you today?Wouldn't the excitement levels be extremely high if there was something like this?Well, there is!SALT brings to you a wide variety of games. In fact, the game changes every day. Yes! Every single day. On Monday, you are figuring out a way to help Mr. Stick escape the murderous Pie Man. On Tuesday, you are defending your planet against the invasion of aliens. On Wednesday, you have to navigate through laser walls to save your life. You might need to kill everything that comes in the way. #JustSayingOn Thursday, you need to help the squares reclaim their rights in the autocratic world of rectangles. On Friday, you suddenly find yourself in a pond of fishes and as some old Mr Darwin said, “Only the fittest survive”, you need to feed yourself and avoid everything else in the fish-eat-fish world.On Saturday, you have to figure out a strategy to build bridges between squares and rectangles to make this world a peaceful place.On Sunday. Yes, we know it's a Sunday!

(That's what high scores are for!)

        "Everything about this game is great, but this company/developer really differentiate themselves from the competition with their customer service and support. Any issues I've ever had with adcap or any kongregate apps were handled extremely quick with the most professions experience.   Try the game, it's addicting, challenging, and very fun. It is a freemium game but don't forget to support the devs but purchasing a gift pack or even just downloading a game you like for $1.  Thank you for the hard work guys/gals",
        "Yes this is addictive, yes it's fun, and it's great because you can spend 12 seconds or 12 minutes on it and still get the same amount of enjoyment. BUT, and this is a very big but, this game is a HUGE drain on your battery. And no, I don't have an iPhone - I have a proper phone - a Sony XZ Pro. So it's not the weedy battery. No game I have ever played drains the battery away as fast as this game does, so it's clearly an issue that I wish they could fix.",
        "About a few years ago, I had this installed on a Droid phone. I never was able to open the app to play. Recently, I glanced through the apps I had & remembered this one. After thinking it over, I decided to get it. Now, I am happy the developers decided to upgrade the game. This is fun. I am contemplating letting the 💰 accumulate for one full day just to see how much I earn. Thank you developers for providing a fun little time waster. I recommend this if you are the type of person who 💘 s making fake money. Try it out & hopefully you enjoy it.",
        "This game is enjoyable, but like many have said, it drains battery life. Moreover, it hangs too long when switching planets. I suspect, like many areas of technology, performance testing new updates with older devices is not even a consideration. If it runs smooth on the latest and greatest then it is ready to ship.  Like many mobile games this is a casino. It's main existence is to make money. I do not have a problem with this so much, but the events give rewards based on leaderboards. Unfortunately, they are pay to win. You are bombarded with options to pay cash. Making the top charts without spending money is not likely to happen.  This game is a time and battery killer, so keep you charger close by.",
        "You should be connected to facebook. So when people change from iPhone to android, we can keep our levels. I just had to restart again and I had 6800 lemons and not much longer to complete the game. What an accomplishment I'm going to try to receive this time",
        "Love this game.. BUT.. and it's a big one.. the only issue for not giving it 5 Stars is they screwed me when i got a new phone. All my hard work and money spent ruined because even though i logged into Kongregate i couldn't transfer my progress.. Sucks.. should prob rate even lower.. waste of time and money and they're ripping me off.."

Second make all types of tools available i got to level 10 and needed  sissors but need 500 coins  and its impossible to earn that many so you need to use real money and well frankly thats BS. Also need to work on the accuracy of the tools.  This has potential and a great start  but needs some work. I will be deleting it in hopes someday you will put some more effort  foreward.",

The game itself is a lot of fun. I enjoy it a lot and its great time killer. But NOT getting what I PAID FOR does not make me a happy customer. This issue needs to be addressed and fixed.",
        "I 9/10 love this companies games however this game has Flaws. You will have nothing that hits the bottom and it will say game over. I am not happy with it ! The ads literally make you click on it and then take you to Google Play store to download it which is very annoying. I would not download it not a good one.",
        "Way too many ads. Every two games you get 30 seconds of advertisment. At one point an ad popped up during my game and made me lose. Played this for 5 minutes and uninstalled, dont even bother to download the game.",
        "Like previous reviews said; great game but the problem is with the ads. I PAID for the ads to be removed and it did nothing. In my opinion an ad after every game is over kill. Like the other Voodoo games. Have the ad bar like every other game, then when someone hits the save me button that is when you force someone to watch the ad. It's a give and take scenario that has worked very well for other games. I'll waste 30 secs of my life to have a second chance but I will not after every game.    I am very annoyed that I paid money to remove ads and they didn't fix it. Ratings like this will continue if you do not fix this issue asap",
        "I always play games with music in the background and while playing this game my music would be constantly shut off because of the ads, I don't mind the ads themselves, just the fact that it constantly interrupts other sounds playing on the system is very irritating. Gave you 2 stars for a nice game, didn't play a lot though so couldn't tell you more.",
        "I paid for the game, because why not? I enjoy VooDoo's games. But please tell me as to why even though I purchased this particular game I'm still getting it riddled with ads? And it's already beginning to to tick me off. Come on, fix this. I understand the ads if I wamt to continue my score, but I paid for pop-ups and other ads to dissappear entirely. It'll get a better score when the issue is resolved."

        "This game is so great. I play it in my free time. Not normally a slots can but this one is so much fun. The fact that you start out with 5,000,000 dollars is awesome to me. If only those were real winnings hah !",
        "So far all the game's seam to be the same. I hope as I go along they get different and not so repetitious. I still don't know what that big wheel is all about. It's activated but it just sits there. Still not quite sure how the challenges works looks like it's a repeat from the first set of challenges. But I'll keep going for now and see what happens.",
        "It's okay. Very well made and very pretty. Repetitive and not very interesting or exciting. Decent time killer but I probably won't keep it on my phone much longer since it's not very dynamic. I'm on level 36 and waiting for something fun to happen.",
        "Just started playing.  So far it's the best, most generous winning slots game I've played since I've been on Facebook, 9+years!!  Not surprising since Ellen is involved.  She is a wonderful,  caring, giving person.  Great slots game...",
        "No offence to Ellen but to havr a slot game where you win nothing of worth and pay your own money to gain more credit is a real low. Just feels likr a rip off as there are thousands of games like this.",
        "What a joke. Spent nearly $200, and 2.5 billion credits on level #Imatellen and only got free spins twice. Didnt even activate either of the other two bonuses. I'd have better odds at a real casino. Thought this game would be different and a bit more fair considering it's by ellen. But she's just like every other app developer, out to scam the consumers out of money. Don't waste your time."

        "love this game!! The control are easy, the graphics are amazing, really well made!!! I would LOVE to see some BIG updates soon, like able to somehow earn gold plz?!?! And maybe have a little more variation of parts u can change. And hopefully some new tracks will come out Right?!? But GREAT JOB to the developers and everyone who put effort into this game. Thx guys  :D",
        "Very nice graphics, the customizability of the cars are pretty good, definitely one of the best free drift games out there! However, it could need accelerometer steering, as the button control is quite difficult to use for me. Recommended for the graphic fanatics. Drift on! - Jay",
        "It's an okay game. The customization is actually really good and the physics aren't too bad either hit the optimization isn't great and there aren't that amen cars. Would love to see an MX-5 though. For some reason my upgrades don't seem to be applying though.",
        "Well... Ive bought all the cars that you can without gold... All you have to do is get to 50x and you will have around 120,000cr and thats enough to buy all the cars... And put what you want on it... Add more cars and add tuning, also remove the god damm machine gun exhaust not all drift cars do that... Fix it because its annoying and it also over powers the sound of the car...",
        "Iv been looking for a desent drift game for ages and now i found it. It has great gameplay and controls and good grafix to this game has hella potentual keep up the good work i cant wait for future updates IL RATE THIS GAME 11/10"

        "I think this game is absolute garbage. OK the graphics looks quite nice but that's all. I got it for free and anyone who paid for this: i'm sorry. The music is repeating every 10 seconds and that without a good cut between the tracks. You'll find lootboxes, which you can only open with keys you have to buy. The game is lagging on my Samsung Galaxy S7 and that's sad. Do not buy it.",
        "Pros: The gameplay is nice and seems to be working smoothly on my nokia 8. Graphics are nice. Skill system leans just over to the pros side of things. Cons: Seems like this game has been translated to English, and who ever did that, did a really half-assed job or just ran it through some poor translarion software. Half of the sentences don't make any sense, which makes the storyline a bit tricky to follow. SO DEVS have someone go through all the translations to be sure that they are corrected.",
        "Good graphics, okay gameplay. Tbh I found the first few minutes annoying as there was either a cut scene or a tutorial every thirty seconds. Let me just get in and play the game or have access to tutorial if I want it.",
        "it's decent. got it for free and honestly wouldn't pay for it. seems to sometimes drop inputs. translation is mediocre and detracts from the story. music is ok, forgettable, doesn't loop properly. my only real issue is the quest menu doesn't display properly and as such is unusable.",
        "The flashy battle effects distracts players from the tedious grinding for EXP and gold. Having to switch between characters to fight similar bosses makes this game feel repetitive without adequate rewards.  Late game is highly unbalanced because you can clear bosses with reflect damage.  Having completed all storylines only half of equipment was unlocked. Also character levels are reset to 1 so there is no incentive for new game+.",
        "The game maybe seem like its not even fun, but give it some time an play it for about 10 mintues an you aill start to love it, an then you will get additive...that what happened to me an i love it"

        "Was pretty short to begin with but Nintendo has supported this game well, adding additional content, even a new mode. The simplified game mechanics to fit Mario gaming on a phone work great and feel natural. The story with it's additional challenges to open new courses are fun, toad run is addictive, the remix 10 is somewhat redundant content wise but also good. I'd rather pay $10 up front than have in-game purchases, the reception to this game indicates that I'm very much in the minority on that. Great game, very fun for a quick session of Mario.",
        "Awesome update! Make the game worth again, when it seems Nintendo had abandoned Super Mario Run, they back and release more content for the half of the price. This is the kind of update I was waiting for, once I didn't paid the game yet, I think this could be a great time to purchase. Probably in the future they will release more content, but the price will back to 9.99, so the best time to purchase is now! Great job Nintendo, I love your games since my childhood.",
        "Favorite game. It has a one time cost for full version and not a monthly fee or several different things you have to buy to enjoy it. I like the updates with the remix, and the star courses. I didnt like that there was so little to do before I bought it. I got bored quick. But was surprised by the cost, and love it after buying it. I do wish we could see our friends land and share things we don't need and give rally tickets to others.",
        "I think it is a great game but i do not like the controls. Yes i know it is meant to be a run but i think it could have a  more traditional Mario controls. The graphics is pretty good. The difficulty could be turned down as the Bowser level is always taking me another 2 days to unlock aft finishing norm lvls. And lastly, i think u could make the village livelier.",
        "I absolutely love this game. I make it a point to not spend money on mobile games cus they typically turn out to be a cash trap, but this was just like buying a regular video game. No adds, and even before buying the full game it doesn't shove \"buy our product\" notifications down your throat. Nintendo has always had good games and I have no doubts that I will keep playing this every day.",
        "This game had great potential and did well with it. Just because there's that wall of 10$ to pay isn't that bad. You had to pay much more when New Super Mario Bros Wii came out (If you bought it). I really like the graphics and how you are challenged to get newer characters like Daisy, Toadette, or even Luigi. 👌👌👌"

Also I have a problem with the match ups in the tournament I have a 370 rating but I'm being matched up against players with 460 ratings. That's ridiculous!",

Now I'm at zero!",

New birds add interesting gameplay elements but spells are an automatic win that add no semse of achievement besides skipping a hard level. If you want some classic angry birds but dont mind clicking through to get to it then give this a download.",

I can't leave it when it freezes, have to leave app entirely, go back to where I left. If I click again and same app appears I can't receive my reward.",

The worst part about this game is that you can only lose 5 times a day. I just want to play the game like how the original game played!"

        "Overall, game quality is pretty solid. Few graphic glitches here and there but can be expected. It would be nice to rotate to see a better perspective and easier to hit.   One must improvement needed is that when you play a bot, it's way too noticable. You need to improve the bot intelligence! I understand why bots would be needed time to time.  Coins could be cheaper too.",
        "I think it would be a lot better if you could play a single player instead of having to play individuals who are too scared for a rematch. Everything in the game requires making a purchase or waiting an extremely long amount of time to get a free gift. It's fun to play, don't get me wrong. I just feel that it could be better by having the choice of playing others or by yourself.",
        "This is overall the best golf game I have come across or any app, in general, relating to sports. My only problem is that sometimes people do not want to, not do not have the ability to create a facebook account. I wish there would be a way to play with your family; without the facebook account users perks.",
        "This game would be awesome if it matched you with people equal to your level but it doesn't. So I spend more time trying to get to the higher levels and not able to upgrade equipment. Of course you could always purchase money but I'm not big on doibg that!",
        "Main screen isn't immediately obvious what does what. Also a bit annoying that my level changed and I didn't see the wager increased so i was quickly running out of coins until I realised I could step down again. Good game so far though.",
        "I used to think it was a Pretty decent game. But it keeps stealing money. I had $21,000, and went to play a game for $20,000, and it lost connection for a dang second and zap went my coins!  This is the first time its happened with the large coins, but its happened several times with the $1,600"

In \"endless mode\" computer usually comes up with words I have never heard of before. Player can never win. If player lost a life but wins a future round why can't we regain a life? Not fun if you know you can never win endless mode.",
        "The game is great. I love how much attention went into making this game, it gets a lil boring (for me personally) sometimes.  Had a few glitches, like one time when I made a move, somehow a blue \"sapphire\" and a blocker square became one square.... which sucked, because I couldn't make a match, that I otherwise could have made.   But I really do love this game.... one of my favorites,  love the challenge level, not too easy, yet not too hard either. One day I'll go back though and try for 3 suns on all levels!! Keep up the great work.",
        "This is one of the perfect games I've played,  it is also fun and can pass time very easily because once you start you can't put it down. Also there are not any annoying adverts,  it is also educational for children to learn new words, that's why I've given this game 5 *****. Thanks!!!!",

Also, why does the Apple version have stars and the android version doesn't? I was trying so hard to earn enough stars to buy the colour packs on my iPod, and I got quite disappointed that I can't do that on android. I guess I'll just delete the game off android since there's really no goal to the game now.",

Quiet whinning about ads. Someonbe has to pay the creators for this game including the upkeep and updates. How else will the creator make his money? 2 choices, either gets ads or charge to download. So I can deal with the ads. It's a FREE APP.",
        "Really annoying when ads pop up and you have to start from scratch. That's really my only complaint about this game, but it's a big complaint. It sucks to feel like you get really far and then all of a sudden it stops in the middle of the game. This is a finished game not an interactive advertisement where it stops you from going further.  In all honestly it plays simply and I like it a lot but it needs some improvements.",
        "I like the game a lot but it would be nice if there was a way to take back or redo your last move. There's been times that while I'm playing, the piece I'm placing ends up 1 square off from where I wanted it to go. Situations like that is where a \"redo\" or \"do over\" option would be very helpful and greatly appreciated. If you were to add that, it'd be a 5 star game for sure. Also some other colors options that didn't cost money would be great too! Other than those couple of things, keep up the great work you guys!",

I know its the game because its when I'm about to pick up something important or jump at a crucial point. Also this ismy 3rd phone and it does it on all phones. This error needs to be fixed.",
        "I love the game. Been loving it for years. I've been noticing alot lately though that when I watch the ad video to double up on my mystery box, it's not doubling my prize. Getting kinda frustrating and just not worth watch the ads anymore. Can you fix this? If not, I more than likely will delete the app and free up the space.",
        "this game is slightly good but  it is lost its priority to me day by day. initially this game was awesome but now a days it seems to me boring, authority takes this game only for business purpose. after finishing level 30 i lost my patience to this game. it gave more ad. but not increase their game quality. so finally i take decision to uninstall this app to release the space of phone.",
        "I am beyond upset, I had about 50 keys and more than 8k in coins. I spent all my time simply doing tasks, daily missions, and much more to get to where I was far in the game. When I logged back on, it showed I was logged in still but I have lost my keys and my coins, it reset EVERYTHING and it even did the whole intro for the beginners. I don't understand what happened.",
        "This game is amazing but I would add that  each game you get a key and lots of coins. Also some people might be playing in a different country than America and they would like to buy something but they don't have dollars 💵 I LOVE THE GAME",
        "Could add more city's it sucks revisiting and not getting new characters.. also the special city boards could have some special effects instead of ... I don't know... looking like a hot dog... what's the point. A hot dog with super speed and stay low would be ideal. Love the game, but to keep playing.. maybe give us something new. The only thing I love is wordy weekends. But only to get the coins back for what I spent on the characters"

There is a glitch where dinosaurs walk around in the air, and your pet gets stuck when you jump off cliffs. Some invisible oviraptors attacked me as well which was kinda weird. The game is smooth except if you equip a tool or tap on that hand sign. Items in boxes dissappeared",

Aside from the long craft times (which are understandable as they have to make money in some way) the game is very entertaining with good elementd and fun mechanics. Its basically a simplified Ark: Survival Evolved for mobile. I am enjoying it and will continue to play it"

        "It's an amazing game so far, the graphics are the best but there are some bugs in the game, I know this just came out but you can't drop tnt when you pick it up. More loot should spawn and the food/water/sleep meter should be bigger. I'm having problems finding water to drink also. But all in all this is an outstanding game and I hope this game gets regular updates! (Ps when I get money for the app store I'll donate because this game is really good)",
        "The game has great potential but there are glitches/bugs that hold it back.  1. The items in the sea become uncollectable after a short while, they remain stuck in one place, which doesn't allow for further sea loot to spawn.  2. The furnace doesn't work, I put iron ore in it but it wouldn't smelt it. 3. after the first quest, the next quest doesn't work.   I have some suggestions to make the game improve.  1. add a craftable  back pack. having only 6 inventory slots is not enough when you go out to an island.  2. there needs to be a way to make the raft go faster. crafting sails for example or crafting a paddle.  3. there needs to be a steering system. so many islands pass me because they are just too far away to swim to, and being able to turn the raft around to go to them will be very helpful.  4. fishing net, when you advance in the game, catching fish is slow, only one at a time. if you could implement an option to craft a net so you could catch multiple fish at once will be helpful.  5. so far the only way I seem to get XP is from looting from the sea. You should make it so you can get XP from gathering on the island, cutting down trees, crafting wood planks,mining rock/ores, cooking fish, catching fish etc..  6. there needs to be more weapon options, a bow for example or swords and guns.  7. so far I haven't seen any wild life on the islands, adding birds, rabbits, foxes, Tigers and  monkeys would be cool.  8. some islands need to be bigger, having a big island to explore would be much more exciting, rather then walking for 10 seconds and you already see the other end of the island.   9. there needs to be a bigger chest!! so far the small chest can only hold few items, being able to craft a bigger chest with double or more the capacity will be good.",

Also please make 2nd versions from winter sports games aswell like snow scooter ski and snowboard",

People will stop playing very quickly as it currently is. Just take it down to an ad break every end of run. Also a way to easily view all positions on the leader board would be nice. Otherwise the game itself is great.",
        "Game is great, but every time you die (and that's really easy to do) you need to watch about 22 seconds of ads. Once i got a 15 second ad, but the skip time stayed constant and i had to watch the entire thing. The game also bugs you constantly about connecting your facebook account. So if you want to be able to play without interruptions constantly, you need to pay and connect to a facebook account.",
        "I would have bought the ad free Version eventually, but it was so annoying even to get used to the game, that I gave up. If you want more people to buy the game you have to give them the opportunity to play without being interrupted every death. Your game can be the best ever but still no one will play it if they have to invest the same time in watching ads that they invest in playing the game.",
        "Too many ads with a skip button that reduces ad time by 10 seconds. Literally, f off, dude. Can't play your game, I play for a minute and than watch an ad for half of that time. Unfair and boring. You almost don't get to play the game. Which is, btw, awesome",

        "It's a great game. I have a few suggestions, though. You could add siblings to the character/life, I think there's somethings you can do with that. Maybe put an option to come from a poor, average, or wealthy family, too? Also, everytime I age, it stops my memberships to art class, music class, and gym. It would be greatly appreciated if you could fix that. How about pets, as well? And friends.",
        "This isnt really even a game it is more like if you could control almost everyting you did in your life. It is extremley interesting and i wasted hours on this game when i was supposed to do some self assigned homework😂😂 my guy died in prison and he had 6 kids. He lived a good life. He had over 1 million dollars in cash and in net worth. RIP sean. You will be missed",
        "I am beyond addicted to this! It really is a lot of fun! But you have to have strategy to get things done right. I'd like more options to do things so hopefully there will be updates. All and all great time killer and I'm so happy it's on no wifi too! Great app",
        "Very run game.  Just wish you could save your progress when you have to exit out for a phone call, text messages, reboot the device or anything that requires you to exit.  That's the only reason I gave 4 🌟's. Once they add save life option I will change to 5 🌟's. Great game though. Would recommend everyone to try this game.",
        "Very nice. I think more careers should be added maybe a family tree option and being able to play on as one of your children? Maybe make transitioning easier it's kind of hard to and takes many lives to get it. Also maybe different traits could be unlocked like 'baby momma' or 'alcoholic'. Overall I love the game and it's very addictive nice game.",
        "GREAT GAME I think this game is worthy of 5 stars. The concept and simplicity of the game is really good. It makes you think about how short life really is and how your actions affect the future. I wish they could add more possibilities to the game. Like more unexpected thing like diseases and conflicts. Make the game unpredictable too. And i wish that they would add more varieties of jobs. I managed to live a perfect life while having perfect stats just in my second try so spicing up the game would be nice."

        "The game itself is fun and enjoyable, BUTTTTTTTTTTT the developers want too much money for upgrades. Adds are infectious and numerous. The weapon upgrades that can be earned are so far out of reach from earning through game play. They just want you to buy them. I'd keep and give the game a better rating if the previously stated issues weren't involved. That's the sad part. I'd like to play it more, but not going to spend $50 plus for a weapon upgrade on a phone game.",
        "Good game. Advert after every mission and some bullets can go through the guy you're trying to shoot at like a hologram. Graphics aren't good at all but you have got recoil and swaying scope that I noticed as well. All in all, pretty good game. Maybe add a toggle to gold your breathe in the future so that it doesn't sway?",
        "Soooo good as a good dish when hungry..  But i have 1 request to you that We can play spec ops only once But this stage is really nice so,  i have to play it again for enjoyment and money also... For upgrades of weapons And i don't know how to change my country in profile Plz give me some reply",
        "After the update on 2nd Mar-18, Spec ops not loading. Game simply terminate itself while trying to load spec ops Level 16. Everything else is working fine. I'm stuck 😓😪 Update: now I can't play even Daily Mission😩😤",
        "It's a real fun game for shooting.  I am giving 3 stars because gears are very expensive. I have reached level 8 without buying anything because all my earnings are not enough to buy a decent gun. You want people to pay rather then buy through skill earned point. But still great game.",
        "I like this game but you have to spend money to really enjoy it. The only way that you can get other guns is if you buy it with diamonds (lots of them) and by going premium which sucks. Graphics isn't even that good for you to spend money for this game. A waste of time tbh. Deleting it"

        "Ah perfect game. Fast pace not laggy smooth graphics, and playable on any devices. But i hope i can change my region like asian.. Bcoz most of the player i encounter is mexecan or spanish.. 1 more thing i hope you add a larger map i guess for team battle i think 4km x 4km is enough.. And 30mins of total playing time.. All in all fantastic game.. A two thumbs up for you guys. Keep it up",
        "Its amazing!!!! I wanted fort nite but even if i deleted everything i have, i still would not be able to get it. It costs sooo much room. With this game, i can have roblox,color switch, and at least 100 pictures and 10 videos, AND still have room for it. This the best shooting game i have ever had! And i have played gta and call of duty. So that says a lot. It is also very fair. U dont get a increase on anything when wearing special clothing. So new comers could be just as good as people at lvl 100. I would deffenety recemend it.",
        "Ok this game is the best battle Royale game I played and I've played all of them. This is smooth and fun and different. But you need to keep adding on the game please cause I love it. Add more guns like a lot. More snipers and possibly a big gun and more pistols and just everything lol. And maybe add some more places on the map. And one more thing, add 100 players to fight if you can",
        "This is no doubt one the 'Best' android game ive ever played so far.       But the main drawback is the lack of map choice..  and i personally think that it would be better if there is more customisable features like hairstyles,etc. and more items to buy from the store using money and not diamonds. Another suggestion that i would like to give is that.. on top of having voice chat if teammates can chat with each other using message, it would be terrific. Thankyou for making this game!",
        "For all this time I only played girly game like The Sims, Temple Run, etc but I decided to give this game a shot earlier today. GOD how I wish I tried it earlier! This is like the best game I've played in years, it's super playable even for someone like me (who have never played this kind of games before) and I just cant believe just how much this game has to offer! The graphic is flawless, no bugs or errors at all, the control is perfect, and it's superrr realistic. This game reminds me of Hunger Game lol. I feel emotionally exhausted while playing this game because I was always in a state of running and surviving. Very recommended!",
        "Look into the option to enalble driving like KNIVES OUT etc. When one uses a gamepad, player can choose the setting where u can use the two joysticks to drive vehicles. Now after mapping the keys , there r no more space or option to drive. Hope u listen, gamers are improving n evaluating your game for you n its FREE !"

It gets really annoying so I unistalled it. I do not sugest you download. I had music playing at it got interupted by a add, mind you that my phone was in sleep mode, and it scared me half to death cause all I heard was a roaring sound come from my phone.",
        "It's a good game, but it makes ads randomly appear on your screen even when the app is closed. Let's say you're watching YouTube for a while. Eventually, an ad will pop up for no reason. This is the only quality that ruins the game. The app opening randomly to show ads. To the creators; that's not ok. ONLY have the ads appear IN GAME",
        "I don't really like it. The gameplay is alright, I guess. The style is simple, so that's nice. However, the main turn-off for me is the fact that it opens itself and makes ads come on whilst on other apps or just normal phone scrolling. This is just stupid. It is obviously a trick to make a not very good game with many ads to roll in that cash. I reccomend to not play this game unless you want to unknowingly give money to the greedy 'creator(s)'. In fact, I got at least 5 ads from this game whilst writing this review! Overall, bad game.",
        "One word ADS. The game doesn't even have to be open. I will be watching YouTube and the retarded ads pop up. While I was creating this there were already 3 ads.",
        "They put ads on your phone without the game even being open. I would be watching youtube with this app not even on and I would get a full screen ad.  Gameplay wise, it's a decent idea. The puzzles are very easy but the struggle of trying to initially move the ball is a little annoying. The graphics seem unfinished at some points (such as the level select) and it just overall seems empty and bland.",
        "I completed it but it only went up to level 45 anoing... also after I completed it it keeps showing adds in the middle of other games apart from that it is a very good game I would recommend downloading it but delete it immediately after completing it🙃🙃🙃🙃"

Could add a global leaderboard for it as well but I'm in no rush for it to be asked immediately, but now with the multiplayer added, it's almost as good as Gran Turismo PSP. Nothing short of authentic real racing. Could add some more classics like the Toyota 2000GT and Nissan 280Z. A must-have game for real car enthusiasts. Another request is the addition of a real racetrack like Suzuka GP circuit and the Nürburgring Nordshleife circuit, the Nürburgring circuit is about 21 km long but that circuit in this game will make it totally unique compared to other driving sims that don't have it.",
        "MOST AWESOMEST GAME EVER!!!💯 The One thing the Game Had to do was Bring in the MULTIPLAYER MODE to make it Awesome.. & Yess!! They Did it. You will never Find an Awesome & Realistic Game as this in the Whole \"Play Store\".!!!!!  This Game is Built for Brilliance, with Real Copyrights from all the Manufacturers.   The Custom Lobby too is Brilliant.. as the Server is more Stabble, just Needs a Bit of Tunings for the Low Graded Smartphone (Due to Lags)  But Overall a Great Concept..!! If Your Still Reading this Review & Haven't yet Installed the Game, then Stop Reading this Already!!!! GO DOWNLOAD THE GAME.!!  IF YOU WANT TO KNOW OTHER AR PLAYERS AROUND THE WORLD, THEN YOU CAN ALSO JOIN INTO THE FACEBOOK GROUP CALLED AS ★ Assoluto Racing - Drift Club ★",
        "Gold Standard racing sim on Android. Period. Brilliant and logical gameplay. IAP's are abundant however unnecessary to successfully progress. Huge replay value. Top end graphics without breaking the CPU/GPU bank - butter smooth framerates, accurate physics model and gorgeous UI lend themselves to a racing experience that will NOT disappoint drivers.  Multiplayer support is solid and highly functional.  Have I mentioned the most important part? The cars - huge selection and growing with every update. Top Tier Developer.",
        "Are there rewards when you play multiplayer races? It keeps lagging when I finish online races and it just wouldn't continue, it just freezes there, please fix it. Overall this game is great but this multiplayer thing is really annoying, I've played more than 10 online races already and only got a reward ONCE....",
        "Its a great game but the 69 charger does not only have 145 HP, fix this. Totally inaccurate.",
        "GUD GAME BUT NEEDS: OFFLINE MODE/NEEDS AI FOR SINGLEPLAYER/MORE CARS/MORE PLAYERS TO COMPETE FOR ONLINE/MORE TRACKS/INTERIOR FOR FIRST PERSON/MORE MODES FOR OFFLINE OR ONLINE/ALSO ADD MAYBE LIGHTS OR INDICATORS/PUT IN OPPENONT ON THE MAP TO ALSO ADD THE WEATHER WIVH WILL GIVE IT A CHANGE"

You can't even grind to try to advance. I loved it, but ended up deleting it even after buying gems in game.  Not worth it when there are other good cooking games out there.",
        "Even when completing offers you won't get your gems. You can't upgrade anything with coins which at one point they become useless. Every single item you want to upgrade you need gems so you have to pay which I think is crazy. I'd rather pay a few dollars for a complete game instead of costing around 75$ to get through one level",
        "Fun game but when I do the activities to get free gems, they're never added to my account. Disappointing and makes me mad. You got your money from me using your link but you're not going to keep your end of the deal. How unprofessional!",
        "I like this game a lot BUT the lack of gems takes the fun out of it.  I've tried a few times to get free gems by installing game's or completing a quiz but I only sometimes get the gems after. And the casino boat thing is a joke. You barely win anything😕 I noticed nearly everyone is complaining about the same thing so I've been waiting for this to be sorted. Nothing has changed so I'll be deleting the app shortly..... What a pity!",
        "Still not getting any gems. After completing xp. One just gets 7 gems which is not enough.. nd what the hell happened?  Suddenly all my upgardes in pasta , bbq, pizza have gone zero.. ? Whrre did all my money nd gems tht i spent earlier go?",
        "If you love using your hard earned money for virtual play this is the game for you. What starts out with gems being a few at low amts as you advance the gem amt grows ridiculously outrageous. Move on because this game will break your bank account quickly."

        "Awesome game! Love the art, love the music, love the style, and the gameplay is actually challenging enough to hold my attention but not enough to be irritating. Perfect difficulty. Not to mention the colorblind mode actually works. I know this is receiving a lot of criticism, but I love the option you guys gave with ads and how well you executed it, that was a very nice touch. You really outdid yourselves with this one!",
        "This title should be moved in the puzzle category in my opinion! Charming story with beautiful low-polygon graphics... Etc! Nevertheless, the game is very short to complete... If, you are not interested in completing the game achievements! There are not enough worlds and levels (right now) and I expect new ones in future updates... Eh! I would certainly convince more mobile gamers to purchase the full game (with unlimited lives and no ads) at 3.99$ CDN. Regardless, I purchased the full version of this game to support one of my favourite Canadian gaming app developer on the Google Play store... 👍😉",
        "A very decent small game. I don't know what other people are complaining about but you can play the game without paying. The music is nice the graphics is nice it's easy to play. I hope there more levels in the future as this is such a fun game. Very nice one from the team at noodlecake Studios. Kudos my n*****",
        "Amazing...simple and superb theme... The music the game play and the concept everything different  from usual boring games .......I give 100/100.......the team who made this game having a  good potential to bring something new..I excepting more games from this crew..best of luck and all my wishes to gys",

        "Saw in Facebook and thought I would give it a try. I am now addicted. I love how realistic they make the interaction seem. The only things that would make it better is if it would let us type our own responses and the system understood them and was able to respond and if there was actually more \"proving innocence\" and less tetrisy type games.. But that doesn't not effect my interest at all. Most addictive and fun game I have found. Will def recommend",
        "I really like this game!  The game feels so real. The text messages you send out and get are from your actual time! Oh to make the game more interesting...you go to the dial tone dial 893702 the erase it don't hit call. At the bottom it will say chat, settings, etc. Click on those then go back to dial tone and repeat. This will give you more \"money\" to buy more lives and stuff. This really helps make the game more interesting! I am currently addicted :)",
        "It is great, nice and interesting story that makes me keep playing. What really bothers me is the fact that the puzzle takes FOREVER to solve. I know that the farther you are in a game the harder it gets, but it's just not logic to collect 25 pieces of each color at a puzzle and they only throw you 15-20 pieces and in such little amount of moves. The only way to solve it is spending money buying hacks or having too much patience. I would have deleted it long time ago if it wasn't for the story.",
        "This game is great. It's my favorite game of all thus far. I love this game. It's so addicting and the story line is perfect. I love how you can text and also receive/make calls. Great game for people who like puzzles and mystery. Passes the time quickly. Only thing I am having problems with is trying to link it to my facebook. The first time I had this game I had gotten pretty far and logged in with ease, long story short, got a new phone, installed my game, try to connect to my facebook for my saved game and.... my phone glitches and shuts me out. So I had to start over. Other than that this game is great I would recommend to anyone.",
        "I like the idea but the responses are off quite often. For example: \"Please don't hang up!\" -I'm here \"I don't know! Not a clue. Doesn't make sense and breaks the immersion.   It's another game similar to SIM - Sara is Missing, which I'd recommend for now. It's more polished and engaging. The characters are more distinct than in I Am Innocent.  This just seems to be designed to make you spend cash eventually, not because someone actually enjoyed developing it.",
        "I've been playing this game off and on for ages, I love the storyline to it and the interaction with the other characters - the only thing to make that better would be if we could submit our own responses rather than the two choices given. The puzzles I like, but it would be interesting to have different types of puzzles rather than the same one repeatedly.  Got to the witness protection part of the game and it has frozen on me. I have collected all stars but no interaction is coming up on the text screen so not sure what to do next!!"

After few hours, the in game UI suddenly hang, can't press anything, but the graphic still continue, i.e. the fire burning still continue to burn, have to quit and reopen the app become more frequent. Plus, during playing, it was shown in the map that I was still under newbie protection and others can't wage war against me, suddenly I was being attacked. Really? Only few hours of game time? Not even suite myself in the game yet. Uninstalled, waste of time.",

More over, there is no report function in game, it should have report function for each player then we should be able to report the cheater since the detector is not functional as well, ban those cheater with their phone ID may be work to stop them."

Let us fight from far away. When we play, please let us have houses because we cannot build houses.",

I've already put 3 games on my pad, spent money on them, and now they're useless so I will reserve my review until I see what happens with this game.",

        "Move forward, flip over and die Move backward, flip over and die Fire the canon, flip over and die Hit by another canon, flip over and die Ram a tank, flip over and die Rammed by another tank, flip over and die Sit perfectly still, flip over and die.  Terrible, terrible controls.  Edit: I'm happy to say they removed the Flip and Die feature and now the game is quite enjoyable. Well worth playing!",
        "Very pay to win and matchmaking isn't great.  Matches new players against players with tons of upgrades.  I know that's a common tactic to encourage those new players to buy the better tanks with cash, but it just made me remove the game.",
        "Alittle bit boring but it has good graphits and makes the players exciting while beating at the enemies . However, to get more excellent tanks like Tesla , it takes so many long times and difficult to hore the coins. I wonder if this game is easy to get coins .  Bravo!"

        "I paid for some tokens and never received them... I have a screenshot of my player ID and can forward copy of my receipt. I bought the 2 million tokens though  Edit: I changed from 3 to 4 stars. The team here did a fantastic job at reimbursing me for the tokens I lost, as well as an extra gift... Ty guys. The only reason fur the 4 stars, is because it fights to connect sometimes in the middle of the game. Otherwise, 5 stars.... Great job, great game, keep it up",
        "I'll start of with 4 stars. I like the game so far. The idea of building your own city is brilliant. But since it's a new game there is still room for improvement. I find progressing a bit on the slow side. Also posting big wins would be cool, and if friends click on the post they can get  small bonus for clicking. Stuff like that. But I'll hope future updates will improve the game but so far you guys are on the right track. Keep it up.",
        "UPDATE - this is a good game. It just takes a little bit to get up there in levels. I am now level 30 and the game does get better. This game is unique and I will try to support it when I can. Keep up the good  work!   Itried to like this game and it does have potential but it's just too tight. You barely win anything. It needs to have more wins that actually pay something. As it is right now it's meant to try and separate you from your money. It's very obvious. It shouldn't be that way. It should be way more subtle.  Yes I already know the more you build your city the bonuses you get but it is nowhere enough. I made it to level 19 before I finally called it quits. It was slow going.",
        "I absolutely LOVE this game. The graphics are awesome! The variety of different slots...the quests and tournaments are a plus for me. The different tasks rock! Never gets boring. Awesome payouts! I love the whole concept of building my own city.  One thing I would like to see is the progress on tournament points. Am I just not looking in the right place to see the progress on the points?   Thank you for this awesome game! Kudos to the developers!!!",
        "I want to give this 5 stars.. but damn give up a little bit! 1 bonus in 2 weeks? Don't win much either..BUT the game is super cute.. So I'll hang a little longer. I'm someone that will drop a few bucks on a game if is worth it.. right now it's a super tighta** game won't do it.",
        "Pay outs and bonuses are few and far between. Seems like you have to waste alot of time trying to earn energy to build city up. Too time consuming to build up city so far. Stay tuned fpr further updates on this game."

Thank you Racing Fever: Moto team...",
        "This game is so good. But only problem I'm facing is that after playing some time I can't control my bike, it keeps on going one particular direction (left or right).Guys please fix this issue.",
        "Nobody can beat the game without expending money. This is horrible. At last levels , with the best bike and full upgraded situation , you cant beat the no traffic side missions. It is unfare. There is some sort of \"you shall not pass!\" situation at last levels. That was bad. Very bad.",
        "Must note this:- Controls are a little bit glitchy. Bikes automatically moves towards a side of a road and crashed.. Besides police and some cars are sucked up the whole race.. Make a little bit easy races....and remove line changeable vehicle and police cars...they are motherfu****s!!!!! Disgusting!!!! That's why I have to uninstall it...Damn it.. I was so close to end!!!",
        "Will say one line it's just fabulous... But yup now want more upgrade wid.. Dis game.. Wid more challenges.. & if already existing any version of dis game.. Dan plz tell me.. Bcuz.. Dis is most deserving game to play for biking its just \"aala game\"..so plz make newer version for dis game.. I want it wid more powerful & interesting challenges & plz some of minor issues dat many people said in der reviews.. But I just loved dis game most...    😘😘",
        "I am not going to spend a dime to get further in the game. Therefore I will never be able to progress. I would rather spend money to buy the game up front so that I know how much I'm going to have to spend. The way this game works who knows how much I'll have to spend to Beat It. Good bye...your game sucks."

        "The game is very good and beautiful, but the thing is that why should I pay to keep playing? 🤔 That's really disappointing actually, because some people don't even have money, so that's so not fair at all. If you could make free please it would be super amazing! Thank you in advance.",
        "I've bought all the past delicious Emily games and never had a problem. I've bought thus version and am having problems. The games sticks alot. Bit I've played first world lvl 6 successfully. However have not received the diamond. I have not burned or spilled anything, multiple times but cannot get my diamond. I know this seems minimal, but at the end in completing the backyard it will in fact be important. Please help",
        "This was one of the hardest Emily games...but the graphics were awesome and it's ones of the smoothest with least amount of bugs.  In that end I enjoyed it, but I will not get all the trophies. I LOATHE the \"add 5 friends\" trophy. I'm not going to do it this time. I just won't have all the trophies.",
        "Love, love, love Gamehouse games! Every games I've played so far had a great storyline, graphics are outstanding & the game never gets boring as I replay them over and over! My only complaint would be u can only go mainly to level 10 on most! Hearts medicine let's you play all 60!",
        "Total waste of time! You expect me to pay to finish the game?! I think not... in fact you should be sued for false advertising! The game is listed as FREE... unless you don't understand what free is, it means PEOPLE DON'T HAVE TO PAY TO PLAY IT!",
        "Firstly I'd like to say buying the game at level 6 is really unprofessional!  It's a shame too, as I would of given a much better rating! I suggest that you put the option to pay at the beginning? The graphics are amazing just the game experience has made me put 1 star. Think about it or review the comments and the game, thanks."

So far I am in love with the game, still keeping the same format from the original one but adding new food choice and new customer.. Thanks to the developer.. I am really hoping if you guys can come up with the 3rd..",

        "This game is still fun thanks to new Pokemon and new challenges. If you like collecting, want a reason to walk more, or just like finding and trading up cute and cool pokemon, this game is still a delight. Receiving a bonus for even slight everyday use has led me to get out of the house more, and Pokewalks have become a fun couples activity for me and my fiancé.  The updated gym system makes it easier to earn coins, but frequent sales might lead you to still buying them.",
        "Sad and pathetic that after months still no complying to the latest Android standards. Deleting account and uninstalling. Unity in design is important to me. This is the only square icon. Apple manages to do that. Google offers a chance to do the same and it is ignored. So now I'm ignoring you. Bye. Previous feedback: No support for Android Oreo 8.0/8.1 (Adaptive Icons). And please don't just shrink the icon and use a white background. Looks ugly. It has 2 layers: icon and background. Quick and easy to implement! Thanks :)",
        "Too many cheaters that aren't caught+accounts suspended/cancelled. Seen enough gyms taken down/built up without any actual players in the vicinity.  Should have given an automatic single level increase to both items and Pokemon storage with introduction of new items and Pokemon.",
        "After the last update everything went well. But its stupid that no help came from niantics devs, not even a sorry. This all the stars I can give to them for the sake of me getting to play the game against .",
        "Still needed more testing It felt like a rushed product. Had very few features it was advertised to have. Last update took away more than it gave. If anything it feels like they've put less pokemon spawns out there than when it launched. If this trend continues it was just a very short-lived success only due to the name of the product used... has potential to be better but is being squandered on \"fixing\" things nobody is too concerned with like changing clothes or text errors.",
        "All of a sudden I am not allowed to play this game on my Nexus 5 (when it was working on prior versions). I just get the message \"My Device is not compatible with Pokemon Go\"... Great job guys for blocking someone who wants to play legally from playing..."

When crossing finish line game keeps playing and doesn't finish, time runs out and you've lost. Please fix",
        "The car will control itself... If you hold left it will turn left for a period but will start to try and straighten up... To test is on lvl 1 first corner accelerate and turn left (any set of controls tried all) it will start turning right seems to be when the prospective changes. Looks like it would be good if it went where you tell it to. Might be due to latest patch so will try again if it get fixed",
        "Awesome Game... no need to spend money to get best cards you can easily earn them... Can play offline too... There is a glitch though in season 7 - save 8 second stage... even after finishing it wont give 3 stars and fails me.",
        "I hope in the new update you can upgrade the engine and body kits as well. That would bring back the fast and the furious Season 7 track 6 nexts to be check it says three lap but you are basicly doing lap 2 twice and it says wrong way. Third lap starts when u finish three laps and doing 4th lap counts as 3rd lap. Needs to be looked at this is cheating  u guys are doing",
        "Love the game. However, after finishing the race, an ad pops up and after closing it, the screen is all black and it stays that way. It happened to me a number of times. The stage is complete but I didn't get any of the cash rewards or the cards. Please fix this or at least give me the rewards I didn't get. Will give it a 5 stars then.",
        "I have a one plus 5T with 8 GB ram still the game hangs at the finish line and all my progress is lost. I have to restart the game to get it going. Please fix this I can sent you the screenshot is you want. I love your game and it would be great if these small thing is fixed swiftly !"

Ok game but not a great game for the players, micro-transaction heavy and very little chances to complete the levels.",

I'd give this game 4 stars simply because there are way too many locked boxes that I have on my land that I can't open.

        "Ive been playing this since the beginning and noticed that its amazingly improving and getting  more fun and playable. Yet something is missing an that is coop or multiplayer where u can fight, build etc in thr beginning till the end. If they can add multiplayer, I know that many more will play and i have no doubt that it will be a great benefit to the devs! Still its a great game and it just needs coop or multiplayer. I say to them\"Keep up the good work!\" Also check \"Outlived\"Ul see what i mean :)",
        "Very fun to play and really addictive. The only problem I really have is the levelling system. Don't get me wrong it is a good idea to need to be a certain level before you can unlock items, however it doesn't make sense that your HP and other stats stay the Same, as if you were still a Lv1 player. Lv20 vs Lv1. Both as strong as each other (if you ignore weapons an armor). Like I wrote, it doesn't make that much sense and spoils the game slightly.",
        "Overall the game is fine. I'm satisfied with the graphics as well as the up-to-date events and the recent update having new weapons and pieces of clothing. PLEASE GIVE ME JUST 4 ENGINE PARTS AND JUST A CHOPPER GAS TANK then I PROMISE I WILL RATE YOU 5 STARS VS RECOMMEND THIS GAME TO ALL OF MY FRIENDS! I open the boxes in Bunker Alfa for so many times then I get 5 chopper wheels and I have no choice but delete it :( I'm trying to be patient... Please I need those parts!!!",
        "Good Game But It Needs Some Pets, Some Robotic Armor, Level 5 Walls, Bunker Alfa 5 and 6 Floor , ATV , Helicopter, Repair Lab And Etc. So please Kefir! Do this Changes In The next Update or After 1 Mounth. And Good Luck For Making Grim Soul Survival and Last Day On Earth Survival a good!",
        "Love it but would be better if I didn't lose all my stuff when I die. Sometime when I go to an area and die then return my body is not there only to lose every thing.  Should also be a way to fix weapons and armor. Melee weapon.. perhaps add a fix option for lol 40 stuff.. 2 stars till it's fixed",
        "This game is very fun and addictive! I got right into it as soon as i started to play. The only thing i would recommend is changing the price of the chests. I feel you would get alot more revenue if they were marked down. The game is going to be alot better when you open it up multi-player. Can't wait for clans."

        "Game is fun however, build times are ridiculous even with premium, premium feels underpowered and won't be renewing it unless there's a real reason to. Arena battles are way unbalanced. Legendary drops out of bought chests are ridiculously low. No option to buy arena gear with diamonds. Etc. Balance the game then we can see if I'll spend $",
        "The game is fun and has potential. But it dragged down by the system that requires you to wait for your fighters to heal after each battle, and you have to have premium in order to heal them fast, or you have to move your fighters around after EVERY battle, which last less than 1 minute. It's so stupid, after my premium runs out, ill probably not be playing anymore.",
        "This may be a long review.  I have played fallout shelter also and it is more fast paced! With only a couple setbacks being that you need to defend the shelter from raiders/monsters which may cause dwellers to die and need money to revive. Also, if left dead too long causes other dwellers to either get ill or become more unhappy.     Now for this game:    Pros:  This game does have more story which I have enjoyed! Also funny social media posts! Has pvp and other events.  Cons:  Building times are long! Resource production is slow and resource requirements are high. Not good if expect long gameplay.",
        "This game is garbage. Just another pay to win game. You get put against enemies way stronger than you. By the time you get around to making your guys strong enough to fight those guys they put you up against guys way stronger than you again. Not gonna keep doing this. Uninstalling.",
        "Very good idea but poorly executed... Greedy people have ruined it and the game itself is not so much fun since you're bound to stay far far behind unless you pay.",
        "There are two problems with this game... One, you will get tired of looking at that loading screen REAL fast. And two, the real problem, the tournaments are shamelessly stacked heavily against players that don't pay through the nose. You will go up against opponents with twice the squad power and 5 castle levels higher than you. You will find yourself in last place very often. Only thing keeping me from giving 5 stars to an otherwise fun, cute, addictive, but shameless moneygrab of a game."

The lense flair off the brake lights and headlights is a bit over the top and a little annoying. And from what I can see, the developers don't care about what their customers have to say and aren't planning to change anything about the game. If you. Love off reading and can handle having to watch an add every 60 seconds, then this is the game for you.",

If I was to download one of the ad games in this I would then get more ads in the next one and so it goes on. Think about it you numb skulled developers. Might have had something otherwise. How about you charge us a quid in the first place and stop asking me to download some childish cartoon farming games. Really nailed your target demographic there 👏, sure it will be a roaring success!"

        "it's an amazing and addictive game... awesome graphics but stories are short.. u have to wait 3 hours for just 2 tickets also there r no free diamonds so we can't make a better choice.  I suggest free diamond after every level and 20 diamonds after a season.. it would be better. fix this then u deserve 5 stars definitely. this is most common  problem.",
        "It's simple, yet addictive. Never put the effort into playing a game like this, but now I'm almost to the last season. I havent spent any money, but to make it way better it would be nice to. Gives u more options along the story. I'm not to find of waiting 4 hours each time just for 2 tickets to continue, but maybe that's how u get hooked lol",
        "I don't know if I will continue to play I am at home taking care of my Mom and trying to play with out having to pay for tickets and diamonds so I don't have time to waste.  I am waiting for the game to change that.  Not all of us have the money to buy extras.  I am one of the people who can't really afford these games.  I have stopped playing a lot of the games because of that.  It's frustrating.",
        "I'm stuck at level 11 ea time I make a choice it says reloadn n it goes back to the start its frustrating cause its been over 24 hrs and I can't even contact d technical department. I do not wna get billed for a technical error",
        "I like it . In my opinion it's alot better and more realistic  than episode.  It's addicting the stories are crazy it's like criminal minds in a book kinfirst da. Only thing I hate is it only give u 2 passes when you start.  And it take over 3 hrs to reload . And if you don't have diamonds you have to choice a different answer it only gives you free diamonds when you first start after that you have to buy it yourself.",
        "I love the game very much! But im wasting my money to buy diamond everytime when i want to choose bruno ! But In the end why linda have to choose rodrigo?? to much wasted.."

Excellent gameplay, storyline,  controls, ... everything.  It had be a long time since I've been this impressed.",

I enjoy that you don't have to drag the items to the customers. It's definitely an enjoyable and challenging game. I'm currently at a \"coming soon\" stage where I can no longer move ahead. I've been waiting a long time and do not want to wait forever. Please do an update soon!!!",
        "Great game but some levels really hard I cant pasd this one level im on for days maybe update make it easier pass level I'm on I just did update...I hope so... love game anyways great game to.. identical cooking joy to map was a great game to but also hard get passed certain levels that game to n I can try play fast with my hands to still cant pass to not playing  cooking joy anymore going stick with this one see if game gets easier to",
        "I love this game! So few games actually suck me in, but this game had me addicted right away. I play on my phone and laptop. Yes I have two different games at different levels lol. I love how upgrades are so easy and it isn't impossible to upgrade or move on. It gets challenging as you go up levels but it's so fun.",
        "It's fun till you run out of energy. They get you too rate the game right away while you are having fun with free lives. Give you enough lives to rate it good then the lives end and you have to watch a min advert or 30 mins for one life Regen. OR PAY. They just want your money at that point. So sad.",
        "I absolutely loved this game but after the latest update I can't get enough gems to help pass the last level! It also takes entirely too long to get updates with new restaurants!  Day after day of not being able to play is why I will be deleting this game this week if there isn't any improvement!",
        "You don't get it but no one wants to play a game which you can't play whenever you please because energy is limited and you have to wait for it to be refilled. Trust me I hate this and I am sure everyone else who plays this also. Get this removed so that I can play as many times I want and whenever I want! Otherwise your game is great. It's a nice app but I might uninstall it because I can't play it all the time!"

        "Let me say that this game is sooooo good. It is the best Pokemon inspired game on mobile (possibly ever?) and highly addicting. The story is engaging and the graphics are beautiful and the nexomon you capture are well drawn and fun to battle with. Amazing game! Hope to see expansions in the future. For only $1 ($.99 cents to be exact) you get so much content. I wouldn't have minded paying $5 honestly (it's just that good)",
        "Just finished the game this evening. Overall impression is wonderful. The game play is smooth, and addictive. The controls are just fine. The story line is wonderful; it's very catchy and addicting too. The \"Pokemon\" aspect that many people seek in games is in this one. You do have the ability catch any monster you encounter, and you do use them to fight your battles. The battle system is set up very well, and it's balanced. The customer service is good, too. I had an issue where I deleted a save file and my diamonds didn't transfer over. The game developer reimbursed me with a smile. I strongly recommend this game to anyone looking for a good turn based rpg game on mobile.",
        "Other then the controls being a little Unresponsive at some times. Nexomon has been one of the best of not the best game I have ever played on the mobile phone and even better then some of my pc games and console games. As soon as I payed for the pro version so that I could use it offline (which was from the start) I've loved the it. I highly recommend it. And will recommend it to my friends.",
        "Very good game, clearly alot of effort went into it. Let's take a moment to improve on it. This game would be great with more sense of community, if I were you I would go ahead and make this into an mmo, there are some out there but with Pokemon and they focus or Evs and Ivs which are a chore, with a chat box the game has a sense of competitionz which is what pokemon is all about. Also the tutorial is way too long and slow, everyone has played Pokemon we all know what to do, shorten or remove that tutorial. Think about what I have said.",
        "Fantastic game,  amazing art and music,  great animation,  story line is interesting,  only thing I don't like is that the in game screen is too zoomed in and it won't let me progress pass the tutorial of diamond shop.  Once you enter the shop,  you can't exit the shop...  Also the title screen is also zoomed in please fix and ratings will go up.",
        "Nice game, could be more. Just bought the game and then my phone have an accidental data wipe, after opening the game again, it says I have to buy it again? What is this? Don't you have any automatic list of buyers in your server? I DEMAND A REFUND IF THIS ISN'T FIXED."

A 30 second ad after a run that ended in just a couple seconds? Multiple times in a row? I understand ads needs to be there, but I'd like to have more play time than ad time.",
        "Very enjoyable game, quite addictive and jumping back into a new game is quick. Couple of gripes, there seems to be some slow down or framrate dipping after an ad has shown and the option to remove ads isn't working. Sort this out and it will get another 2 stars",
        "The game itself is pretty fun. I think I'd like it. But the ads are far, far too intrusive. Not only are there too many. But, many of them have timers. Some are 30 seconds, and you can't break out. Too annoying. I have no interest I sitting and waiting for ads to finish",
        "Too redundant. After a couple times it's boring and way too many Ads. I only played 5 rounds and there were Ads after every round. That's 5 Ads for every minute of gameplay (give or take). Developers are making a killing. Little too greedy if you ask me and all of you are falling for it.📵",
        "Its shameful how some developers ruin their games with such amount of ads! A new ad every new page!! WOW! For that kind of games, the ones you die quickly - it's not recommended to have a new video ad on every page! It makes you get board of the game and you end up watching more ads than playing the actual game.. 2 stars for the concept and beautifully ruined game.",
        "Waaay too many ads, especially in the beginning when you're still getting the hang of the gameplay. Having to watch a 15 second ad after every crash – given how often that happens – is unnecessary. Granting 3 lives between ads would do a lot to keep players who would otherwise say \"I don't have time for this\" and drop the app like I did.  I would even be willing to pay to get rid of ads once I know that I like the gameplay, but the current system interrupts play so much that I couldn't even get to that point."

        "Recent patch has many bugs.  PVP disconnects often, shows a loss when score has me at a win, etc... VERY buggy!  Also, the hacks still exist and higher levels really are now a PTW (pay to win)... you cannot grind  mats to beat others.",
        "Great game, dunno what people complain about, upto 4-5 free packs a day + 2-3 pvp packs and they still want more. Its reasonable but its free so obviously you will have to play it to earn. Joining an active group and playing single player helps. GG",
        "It was great in the beginning. But now it's obvious that it's pay to win. They're so money hungry that they shove stuff in your face to buy. I'm done. Don't get sucked in.",
        "Fun game but definitely set up so you have to pay money to advance further. Suggestion for PvP, let players know how much each of these yahoos have paid into it. Once you start fighting you can tell who has put money into the game and who had played to level up.",
        "The way this game is designed allows you to beat the game without buying anything, unless you want to. You can get enough necassary upgrade items by doing a little grinding and can exchange PvP tickets (which you earn through winning online pvp battles) for coins in order to buy things in the store. The store also has an incredibly brilliant method of selling items. They increase the price of rebuying the items or card little by little which allows the player a chance to buy some upgrade items without having to invest all of their coins in one item (although there are items that are more expensive but the most expensive are only cosmetic and don't buff the player at all). The developers of this game did it right and found a way to make microtransactions more of a fun extra thing that can add to the game aesthetically instead of making them the only way to win without sinking as many hours into the game as one would in Skyrim or Fallout.",

        "I've been playing candy crush for close to 4 years. Today I'm on level 3139. For the very first time I got the jackpot on the daily booster wheel. Thought it was impossible to get. Have read other comments saying no jackpot ever. Well today is a first for this challenging, sometimes very frustrating game. I play every day just to keep up with the free boosters. It's a free game that is fun.",
        "It's a very lovely game with nice graphics and I love the challenge and the difficulty, it helps you to think and make good choices but I don't understand why I will have to buy the gold bars that I earned playing the game. That's not just right. There should be options to buy additional gold bars not telling me my gold bars is filled and I need money to get it",
        "It's really addictive,like I'm a Sugar Crush- aholic :-)  But..... I had collected 60  gold bars and I couldn't get them unless I paid 2.99. So I wasn't to impressed by that. But nevertheless it's a great game so keep up the good work. Two thumb's up for me",
        "I love playing this game and would give this app a lot more stars, but for some odd reason I am not showing as completed the Goal of the level I am currently on. It's very frustrating to me because I have hit the targeted first Star and had recently hit ALL THREE Stars showing normally that I completed the Goal. No dice. I hope someone fixes this bug soon. It's making me not want to play anymore and I love playing this with my kids.",
        "It keeps telling me my \"gold bars are full\" when I do well, but wants real cash when I try to use them. I refuse to spend real cash on an online....but addictive as hell that I am tempted to! Advise...If you have the sliqhtest of addictive personality. Stay away...."

        "Best curling game I've seen Enjoy the graphics, controls, love the 1 on 1 against international players and career game options. Seems consistent and easy to learn. Needs a few tweaks like... throws that don't make hog line or touch hogline must be taken out of play. Have seen the bug that others reported, sometimes rock after thrown disappears , some kind of glitch that happens occasionally.  Sometimes the sweepers don't react to my movement to sweep. Would love to see 8 stones instead of 6. If you love curling, this should satisfy",
        "Great game except for hackers. There is a hack that allows some to bump or change finish of a throw. Yoy can go from having 2 scoring to opponent having the score, changing after the rocks stopped. Developers have not replied ti report. Fine for some fun but don't waste your money in upgrades",
        "Very fun game. Multiplayer is awsome! Please add private matches so i can play with friends.   Physics still need work to hold up to real world standard. Rocks dont follow thru on take outs in real life as they do in this game. Also (rules), a rock needs to make it all the way over the hogline in order to stay in play.  Thank you for making this game!",
        "Good fun. Physics seem good, sometimes my sweepers don't sweep at all but I don't think that makes too much difference. I'd like to play alternate ends rather than winner goes first and the rocks don't spin which would add a bit of something to the graphics. I've yet to play online, just practicing against the CPU.",
        "Decent. The game is close to curling. Issues are that the only real way to earn coins it to play online mode. If you do career mode you actually have to SPEND coins to play, and there's no payout for winning. The rocks don't behave like real curling stones, but it's the best curling game you'll find on your phone.",
        "Physics are not like real curling, rocks are dead in the house when hit, physically impossible doubles and triples, improper use of the free guard zone rules (if a rock is in the house, it is free to be removed...not in this game).  Connecting people across the globe is a cool idea but you frequently lose people and you win without finishing a game.  I've played for 35 years so I speak from experience."

        "This game is very polished.  Beautiful console quality graphics and smooth gameplay designed to work well on mobile.  The voice acting is excellent and the gameplay fun and engaging.  The only issue i have is the stamina system.   Only being allowed to play 5 duels then wait over 2 hours is stupid.  Why would i want to spend money on getting cards for it if i cannot use them more?",
        "Changed to 1 star because my data has been erased TWICE now. First time I got a new phone and it wouldn't let me transfer over my data with my konami id. Fine. I was missed but not that pissed. I start a new game, get kinda into it, open my app the next day, and my data is gone AGAIN!!! Not uninstalling because I do genuinely LOVE this game, but y'all gotta do something about this. I'm not playing this game again until I get my data back.",
        "this truly an amazing game, there's really only a couple of things, why reduce the monster and spell/trap zones to only 3 cards? I wouldn't say it's bad, I just don't see why you'd need to do it.. plus the average deck size of yugioh is between 40 and 50 cards, why limit us to only a max of 30 cards? (not including the 5 for extra  decks) but all in all its a great game! Finally got my six samurai deck!😄 also, I think it'd be an awesome idea to put in a way for duelists to redeem the codes on the cards they've purchased IRL. I bet that'd get even more duelists to play! Just a thought though😊",
        "My app is not opening. I love this game wish you have have out more different cards in the packs. I would like to see swords of reveling light. A bunch of rare magic and trap cards. You should not be able to use Odion's chain reaction duel sense in the PvP duels.",
        "Found Yu-Gi-Oh on Netflix last week and decided to rewatch it. A few episodes in, and my love for the show rekindled, I got eager to play the game myself. I used to play with Yu-Go-Oh cards when I was a kid but it's been about 12 years since then and so all my old cards are in the loft, not that I know anyone IRL anymore who would fancy a game anyway, and not accessible right now... plus I had forgotten most of the rules too. But this app is just what I was looking for: a way to relearn the rules and have a bit of fun. Perfect for whatever skill level you're at with the game!",
        "Almost perfect app. If and only if,  they add more slots for monster cards just like the original one. The camera angle is not as good as what I've expected also. I will be downloading this soon if they make changes in this app. For now, thumbs up for overall,  but thumbs down for the in game experience as stated lately.  :)"

        "Very good app that trains logical thinking. If you want to be a computer scientist, math isnt everything since math and logic are different areas. This game gives a pretty good idea of whats behind coding, and its a good supplement to play when you are bored while improving some skills at the same time. The controls could improve, such as being able to reset the bots position, or cancel a loop run without having to reset all the code. Im looking forward for more planets :D",
        "Good concept, but wont really teach you anything about coding. Lacks the ability to change anything once a loop is initiated, aside from resetting all your work. Game is also very short and puzzles tend to vary from hard to easy and back again with little reason. There is also a lack of a hint option for anyone who is stuck. Game has potential, but seems more like an early beta release.",
        "Definitely needs more content. I enjoyed exploring the basics on logic and ordered processing while solving problems. Simple and intuitive it definitely can act as a gateway into programming. I would say that the app needs a feature to stop a simulation as it forces you to start again if your loop is faulty. Other than that I can't wait for more puzzles and/or level builder etc.",
        "One of the best applications I have encountered till date. Am not into programming, but still had to learn it as a necessary course for a semester. There was no need of it afterwards, so the teachers were simply skimming everything. We were taught from basics to looping in two classes with zero previous knowledge about programming. But still this thing caught my attention. Only if they would have recommended this game to one and all, we would have spent a nice semester. This game pretty much explains the basics, but with better understanding. Great job.",
        "Great puzzle game. Good for introducing programming concepts in a fun way. Suggested improvements: A way to break out of infinite loop without losing work. Also noticed that steps cannot be edited after pressing stop part way through simulation. Hats off to the devs overall. I'm looking forward to future puzzles.",
        "Difficulty level is all over the place. Doesn't really do well to teach programing concepts and more of just puzzles.   Coding is about finding the most efficient way to do something.   The game actually encourages you to do an infinite loop and run redundant steps to complete a puzzle.   Crashes almost all the time"

This version looks the same graphics wise, but these are the worst controls possible! Too small space and the fire button and move buttons aren't very responsive. I looked for this game before and it wasn't in the store now it is. Want to rate 5 stars but please fix the controls first. Too hard to play and enjoy at the moment.",
        "If the controls were better, this would be 5 stars. This really reminds me of my childhood. I was around 12 years old when this came out. Great retro game that is authentic and gun, except for the controls, they don't respond all the time and the placement is bad.",
        "Its the actual Galaga but the controls are horrendous. Please fix asap.  I don't know why they stuck with a d-pad and A and B buttons.  Modernize the controls.  Tapping anywhere on the screen should allow you to shoot.  Sliding your finger left and right should allow you to move.  They should allow for 2 different control options classic and modern.",
        "You should be able to change the on screen controls to your liking, the on screen d-pad has and up and down button that does nothing and it just takes up room on the screen. But this is the closest to the real thing on the whole Play Store and it's still fun.",

    "description" : "The objective of Galaga is to score as many points as possible by destroying insect-like enemies. The player controls a starfighter that can move left and right along the bottom of the playfield. Enemies swarm in groups in a formation near the top of the screen, and then begin flying down toward the player, firing bullets at and attempting to crash into them. In later stages, some enemies even break from an entering group in a frantic attempt to crash into the player. The game ends when the player's last fighter is lost by colliding with an enemy, being hit by an enemy shot, or being captured.A \"hit/miss ratio\" statistic at the end of the game, and a bonus \"Challenging Stage\" that occurs every few stages, in which a series of enemies fly onto and off the screen in set patterns without firing at the player's ship or trying to crash into it. When you destroy a group of enemies, you are awarded 1500 points.These stages award a 10K-point bonus if the player manages to destroy every enemy, but otherwise 100 bonus points for every enemy destroyed. Another feature in the game is for enemies to randomly transform and organize into a certain formation, which awards the player bonus points if they manage to successfully destroy it.Another gameplay feature new is the ability for enemies to capture the player's fighter. While the player is in control of just one fighter, a \"boss\" Galaga (which takes two hits to kill, the first hit will turn it purple) will periodically attempt to capture the fighter using a tractor beam. If successful, the fighter joins the enemy formation as a satellite to the boss Galaga which captured it. The captive fighter becomes an enemy, turns red, and likewise, it can be shot and destroyed. The player can still fire while being captured up to the point their ship \"touches\" the captor, which could be considered an opportunity to shoot the captor down before it can manage to successfully capture the player. Captive fighters can be freed by destroying the boss Galaga towing it while it is attacking. The freed fighter will then combine with the player's fighter who freed them, offering doubled firepower but with the disadvantage of a target twice as large. If the player destroys the captor while it is still in formation, the captured fighter will not be rescued, and will instead fly away after a diving run (assuming the player does not destroy it) to appear in the next stage as a satellite for another boss Galaga where it can again be rescued.*Notice: This game doesn't support Android 8.0+",

In later stages, some enemies even break from an entering group in a frantic attempt to crash into the player. The game ends when the player&apos;s last fighter is lost by colliding with an enemy, being hit by an enemy shot, or being captured.<br><br>A &quot;hit/miss ratio&quot; statistic at the end of the game, and a bonus &quot;Challenging Stage&quot; that occurs every few stages, in which a series of enemies fly onto and off the screen in set patterns without firing at the player&apos;s ship or trying to crash into it. When you destroy a group of enemies, you are awarded 1500 points.These stages award a 10K-point bonus if the player manages to destroy every enemy, but otherwise 100 bonus points for every enemy destroyed. Another feature in the game is for enemies to randomly transform and organize into a certain formation, which awards the player bonus points if they manage to successfully destroy it.<br><br>Another gameplay feature new is the ability for enemies to capture the player&apos;s fighter. While the player is in control of just one fighter, a &quot;boss&quot; Galaga (which takes two hits to kill, the first hit will turn it purple) will periodically attempt to capture the fighter using a tractor beam. If successful, the fighter joins the enemy formation as a satellite to the boss Galaga which captured it. The captive fighter becomes an enemy, turns red, and likewise, it can be shot and destroyed. The player can still fire while being captured up to the point their ship &quot;touches&quot; the captor, which could be considered an opportunity to shoot the captor down before it can manage to successfully capture the player. Captive fighters can be freed by destroying the boss Galaga towing it while it is attacking. The freed fighter will then combine with the player&apos;s fighter who freed them, offering doubled firepower but with the disadvantage of a target twice as large. If the player destroys the captor while it is still in formation, the captured fighter will not be rescued, and will instead fly away after a diving run (assuming the player does not destroy it) to appear in the next stage as a satellite for another boss Galaga where it can again be rescued.<br><br>*Notice: This game doesn&apos;t support Android 8.0+",

It happened only once; looked like the opponent was hacking the game. He was potting all of the balls like that, and there was also full network. If you can fix it, then the game can be improved.",
        "Great 8 ball pool game. Plays great and looks great. 1 slight issue tho. Im from Ireland but i seem to be playing people from India and surrounding countries.   The Irish and Indian flag are kind of similar so im guessing thats where the issue is coming from.  I cant seem to edit my location either.  Would be great if someone could help but if not, ill be happy to continue playing against random beautiful Indian women 😁",
        "Hey miniclip.. good morning.. i am from india.. i was playing 8 ball pool dubai match. I was just about to win when i hit my solid ball and then last black ball was left but the ball goes in opponents hand said that you didn't hit your ball.. what was that? Can you please stop all these hacks and all for other users. There is no fair gameplay between each other.. please do some favourable to all users.  Hope you will take quick action in this manner Thanks.. Apoorv",
        "First of all It's joyful game few notes need to address it:    1_last 3 weeks is suddenly stopped without farther notification.. And I was about to uninstall it..     2_one of the question was you can play with other users offline. This is not correct!...     3_ need to add \"Edit and changing names\"     4_Game rated with 5 star.. Than you all 🎱",
        "I realize y'all gotta get paid but why make the playing experience for those of us that don't pay cash money.  Not allowing a player to select a pocket when shooting the 8 ball and allowing your opponent to shoot and win. I guess I'm pretty good because nobody has been able to get rid of me playing pool. Instead I seem to get strange lock ups or no response from game. I always seem to lose 100s of thousands. It's a pretty good app and I've sent many people to download your app.",
        "8 ball i have been playing it for sometime now and I spend alot of money on the specials.. great specials.. but I noticed whenever I buy coins I don't win any games until those coins are over and I'm only winning recently 2 games maximum in a row and normally my win streak used to be 7 and above... I don't know why this is happening but it sucks because it's putting me off the game.. it's like 8 ball is making sure I'm losing hence the rate 3"

And then you have that \"Aha\" moment. There it is.  The trap is set. Lol you are not continuing to play because it is addictive. You play in order to collect coins so you can buy stuff to make the little fish happy. 💘 the graphics kind of a little like an underwater Farmville with the plants 🐟 and decorations you can get fort your aquarium. I do play with 🎶 turned off. Cute game so far.        Graphics make it better than Candy Crush.",
        "With an easy guide, on 'How to play'. Once you get going its great fun. Dare I say quite addictive. Fantastic animations. Amazing back ground music. Plus, no app freezes either.  Its an 'A☆' from me at least.  Only, what would be a great idea. Is all the piggy bank jewels you build up, should be awarded for your hard efforts. Should not have to buy them back.  Only purchase jewels when desperate.",
        "Great game. Challenging, fun, and addictive lol. I'm 32 and play this often so it's not just for kids . Give it a try it's very satisfying . Just wished you could add friends ... People that play whom you may not know so we all could help each other. That would make it more interactive and a lot more fun. No one I know plays so it would have to be other fellow fishermen 😉",
        "Fantastic game! It's great fun decorating the aqariums and the game board is very clear. The recent move of the boosters to the right hand side of the screen was a VERY bad decision, as I have accidentally used them when my hand has brushed against them - this has happened many times already. A good addition would be a marker indicating a purchased item.",
        "Because you only get 5 lives and you make some levels with too few moves. It would be nice if you could interact more with your fish and tanks. The whole point of beating levels is to build up your tanks...but you can't do anything with them while waiting for lives. It would be a fantastic game if there was more to do within the tanks!",
        "I love this game, its very challenging. The only thing I don't like is that your aquariums end up way overcrowded with stuff before you can move to the next aquarium. Of course you can move on to the next one as soon as its unlocked, but I won't move on until I have all 3 stars. So honestly, I guess this is just my issue. I probably should have given it 5 stars, because my issue is the only reason I didn't."

        "The only game where I'm experiencing so much lag even though my Internet speed is good. Its happening more after the 3.1 update. Why sacrifice the gameplay for graphics? It totally sucks and game insight need to sort out this problem. Game is becoming worse instead of getting better. Oh, and it's totally pay to win. Other games are much better now.",
        "Oh mannnnn😥 Its a damn addictive game love it too much but............ The game has totally become pay to win .Guyz make some improvement.Dont just earn money through game.Gameinsight should  decrease  gold cost of gold  weapons.And also introduce new assault and shotguns without including any event. Make those new year guns available soon and dont keep its gold cost higher than juggernaut coz its fire rate is damn slow .Plz after reading this review make  changes in game .This will not only benefit players but also your company in increasing your game lovers and customers.",
        "Hate the multiple control point matches. Rewards are way, way, WAAYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY too low considering how incredibly expensive weapons and upgrades are. You win, you get 30 trophies. You lose, you lose 60. They welcome hackers/cheaters into the game. You pay real money for gold and upgrades, you are guaranteed wins and quick 0 hit kills. 100% pay to win. Greedy. No more from me.",
        "Not sure why people are saying this as a bad game and all.  I loved it and recommended it to some of my friends also. They also loved it.  Game is online multiplayer mode and even if you didn't like it in the first 10-15 minutes, give it some more time and u'll definitly keep playing it.",
        "Don't waste your time or money! Game needs serious rebalancing, later game guns feel powerless against ridiculous tank-like armor and headshots mean almost nothing! Would give the game a better review if at least headshots dealt more damage.",
        "Have had this game for a bit its not bad but dont always get the kill when I'm the only one shooting at an opponent and same when I'm shooting an enemy, a team mate kills them and i wont always get an assist. Could you add more? Maybe get creative with a campaign or more maps so we can have a choice between capture/ defence and team death match. Still worth a download for those who like a good fps"

        "Amazing game if you like naval warships. UPDATE: As of Feb 17 2018, the new update has seriously increased the game content and fun level. UPDATE as of Feb 27 2018, Lowered my rating to 4 stars because there is a constant issue with the timers or something like that.  I login and collect the crate and start a module upgrading then login several hours late and is like no time elapsed in the game from the last time I logged in. This has happened several times in the past as well.",
        "Addicting can't seem to put it down. I recommend it, I love everything about it, gameplay, graphics, controls and smooth. Only thing though guys is the ships give us more to rent as a beginner, the ships given at first are no match for any of the ships and you don't get much to buy upgrades. Gives something that we can at least have a chance, other than that love the game, (GOOD WORK!!!)",
        "Addicting but not worth it. Everywhere in the game there are a bunch of Russian POS hackers. You can have a fully upgraded Battleship and a little tiny Destroyer or frigate will come along and one shot it with a main cannon from half the map away. This should not be possible. I tried using fully upgraded versions of Destroyers and frigates and I couldn't even scratch a normal battleship. As long as the Russian POS hackers aren't playing this game it's not worth it.",
        "Definitely a good game and worth your time and money. Only issue that developers really need to attend to is how they select the team. You can't have 7 ships of high ranks against 5 or 4 ships of low rank. It makes a person want to delete the game even after spending money on it. Keep same ranked players together in a battle. Really irritating.",
        "Fact need a good connection to keep control of your ships Now, I have plenty of $$$ nothing to spend on it. Waiting to get the last max destroyer ship i can get on the random container spin.  Also noted... I open up the app the next day and the container count down says 2+ hours. It should read 0 zero I would think.",
        "This is a fantastic game one of the best by miles. I am not sure however, that the latest update was such a success. Prior to update the smaller torpedo boats had a good chance now that dynamic has been removed by the dominance of the larger ships firepower and slow reload times on torpedoes.  This means that the strategic component has been somewhat diminished"

If you're trying to complete a challenge, every couple tries it will reset to free play mode and you have to go intentionally kill yourself which sometimes takes way too long. Then if you don't tap the challenge button exactly right, you have to free play again. Then every time you get back into the challenge screen, you have to scroll all the way through every one you've completed. The game would be fun if it wasn't so infuriating.",
        "I paid the 2 odd dollars to remove the ads since i really enjoyed the game. If you are thinking about doing the same DON'T. Paying the money removes ZERO ads. It simply allows you to skip most of them after 5 to 10 seconds rather than watching the whole 20 to 30 second ad. They still pop up just as often and are just as annoying. Personally I would wait for another developer to make a good clone of the game, shouldn't take long it's a simple engine.",
        "Why would someone only play one round of this fun game? Install this game to find out.  Hint: greedy developers like to hit you with multiple ADs between every attempt. These one-off games are only an attempt to be the next Flappy Bird, but with the most annoying implementation of AD serving.",
        "If you're a sucker like me then you paid the $2 something to remove the ads. Doesn't work, obviously a scam. Helpful Hint: If you play with data and Wi-Fi off the ads actually disappear regardless of whether you paid to have them gone or not. Although this shouldn't have to be necessary it's the only way you're gonna enjoy this game as there is and ad Every. Single. Time. You. Die.",
        "Terrible game. I can't pay twice without having to sit through a full 30 second add. I found it faster to exit out the app and go back in to avoid adds. But there are just too many adds that it made it not fun after the first few goes.",
        "WAY TOO MANY ADS! Its so frustrating that after three failures an ad plays for 30 seconds. Also, why are you asking for access to my storage and location and the ability to make and receive calls? As a developer, get with what your customers want. Then I'll consider buying something."

        "I enjoy playing with people from all over the world and enjoy the game in general. Only thing I wish we could change is the \"robux\" thing, and how everyone makes fun of people who don't have any. Other than that the game is great! It may lag but give it a Shot!~ (^.^)",
        "This is the best game ever! It is easy to play and the best part I like is you get to desing your avatar to look cool. I know a lot of people complain about you have to pay money to get robux, but if u have money just save up and if u can't, get over it.Also another feature I like is you get to make your own level and I think that is really cool. The only thing I do not like about this app is it does not let you build a level of you play on a tablet or phone. Another thing is I don't like all the glitches. Like all of a sudden it kicks you off the game and the next you are back in the game.",
        "I love this app very much! But what I hate about this app are too much oder (online daters) which now roblox users made some disgusting and inappropriate memes or posts. And too much bullies, for those who don't have robux likely got bullied in the game and if we report them roblox doesn't read... that's all",
        "I love this game. I will play it with my free time. I will tell my friend to go and download it so me and him can play on the same game. He plays Minecraft more but I lost focus on it. But he says he likes playing jailbreak and tycoons. So I give this a five stars. BTW, best game ever made.",
        "The new update you guys made is horrible.. I loved this game so much but then you updated it and now every game I play lags. No matter how low my graphics are at. I've tried deleting the app and re-downloading it but it doesn't work. Please fix it cause now roblox is barely playable",
        "I have been playing thisbfor the longest time and there have been bugs and glitches sometimes it would crash my phone even if I update it it still does these thing could you fix it please I hate having my phone crashing as I own a business and need it for out and about trips and stuff. Thank you ever so much my complements to the creators."

It shows me the loading screen for five minutes, then crashes. It would be wonderful if there could be a fix for this.",
        "I recommend anybody who is reading this review should play the game. The game is way more better than the original Sims. Plus it's free. And it's a lot more realistic. Only thing is it does need Wi-Fi and it takes up a lot of phone space but it doesn't drain out my data too quick. Seriously I rated 5 stars for the quality and the quests.",
        "I like this game so much (it's so much better when you are a VIP 15 player) but it's unplayable without tons of LPs and SPs (takes so much time to complete some simple actions) other than this it's the best life simulator game",

        "I played this on my old phone which was a Moto but yesterday my phone broke on me so I went and got a new phone it's downloaded quick but when I tried to open it it's keep saying \"Sims free play as stopped working\" and it's really annoying me since I loved playing this game and I reached level 12 on my old phone and I can't even play it anymore.... PLEASE FIX IT",

        "I love the series more and more with every installment. Great game, with simple aesthetics and a fun way to coklect gear and powers. The animations are rag-dolly sometimes but other than that it's perfect. I have one suggestion for Nekki. Why aren't you guys making games for consoles? You're too advanced for mobile. You could be the future mortal kombat sensation.",
        "Graphics are awesome, it controls and plays very well. Fights are slick and intense with wonderful animation that makes great use of slow-mo to highlight big moves and finishing hits. The only real barrier to me giving this a full hearted recommendation is that there are microtransactions ALL OVER THE PLACE. If you don't like those distracting you constantly, not the game for you.",
        "Simply World's best game. This is the best game I Have played. Good graphics and amazing gameplay. But it's mission are pretty hard.I have a request can you please make a second name change because when I first started playing in excitement to play this game I had chosen a bad name and I wanted to change it. And I think like me many players had done this so please think about this.",
        "Loved the new BGM... ABSOLUTELY beautiful. Just one thing, please make the animation speed a little bit more fast. It's slightly annoying to wait that long for a window to open to show the equipments or switch between armour and equipments. Please note that.  But overall...it's the best game I've ever played. Kudos",
        "Nekki .. I don't know what's wrong with my app apk. I can't select the country, I mean Legion/Dynasty etc. There is a request which i want you to up upgrade asap in the game. I want you to add a option of 'Multiplayer' so that we can play the game with our friends too. Perhaps the game is awesome. Loved it.",
        "I played it's first version years ago I liked it too. But it was little boaring I did not completed the game. But this version is awesome I completed all the chapters today n hoping for new chapter to begin n launch of shadow fighter 4. Pls add some more moves of the body armor. Wepons moves are fine but add more armor moves. I liked it..."

Kids, together with their parents, can create their own little masterpieces, creating similar effects to the ones acquired on paper. The game was created with the youngest in mind (tested on two- and three-year-olds), but older kids and grown-ups will also have lots of color-splashing fun here.We can play in the following way: - we color pre-prepared images selected from the library,- or we create our own \"masterpieces\" using provided painting supplies.Little kids will find here many pictures to color with a bucket tool that fills large areas at once. Older kids and adults can try drawing their own creatures and scenes, and color them with a wash of paint, crayon or spray paint. We can also add highlights and shadows, correct mistakes with eraser, use undo and redo functionality or change the size of our preferred coloring tool.We can pick colors from two color palettes: - basic (18 colors)- extended - over 200 colors.The images are grouped in the following categories:- for girls,- dinosaurs, animals and nature,- fruit and vegetables,- underwater,- vehicles.Additional features:- save your own projects and return to them later on,- share your saved images through e-mail or on Facebook,- return to the project you're working on whenever you want,- listen to the pleasant music in the background (with an option to turn it off).",

        "Great game! I've been hooked alot! It may be hard to earn money but I find this to be the main challenge of the game. Good however I'm experiencing a bug right now wherein it says there is not enough space in my bookshelf even though its empty. Pls fix this asap. I cant buy books to increase my stats. Sad.",
        "I really like this game a lot! So far I haven't found anything that I don't like. I mean, it's a bit irritating how much it costs to expand after the first 3 times or how much it costs to upgrade furniture after the first 3 or 4 times too, but so far those are my only dislikes. I had it on my tablet then uninstalled 3 games just to get this, so obviously my dislikes aren't too strong of dislikes..lol. But everyone is entitled to their opinions, and mine is that this game is totally worth 5 stars! 💖😄😊",
        "Just like real life... I'm broke as a joke and buy lots of ramen. 10 out of 10!",
        "Honestly at this time I like the first one better it takes hours and hours to make $5000 in the bank while my total earnings were like $35000 I spent $30000 just on food making next to nothing cause we all spend $75 on food everyday second there is a ton of content that's in the first one and great ideas but not in this one (yet at least) the stock market is kinda a joke with only 4 stocks to buy there isn't much option along with no tab to see what you bought those stocks for so it's a guessing game It does have a pretty interface 5/5 for that :) the casino needs some scratch off tickets and in the beginning give a little more options on doing stuff because it's just eat sleep work , eat sleep work for hours before you can do anything also take off the cheating reset thing and just cap the offline interest at like 12 hours (cough cough I tried to cheat :p) but I wouldnt have tried it if making money off the bat wasn't so bad now don't let this discouraged you from picking up this game it is fun even if it's missing alot of features basically it's in alpha I will change my review as the game is updated   sorry Dev 3/5 is all I can give at the moment there is alot of small stuff missing that makes game play rough along with the time sink of starting a new game and barley making progress for hours is discouraging keep doing what your doing and make me give you a 5/5 :)",
        "I can't seem to hear any music...",
        "I just saw this game and when i played it, I immediately knew this was the sequel. I know I've only been playing it for a couple minutes, but i gotta say, this is a big improvement from the first game, I have no idea why people are giving bad ratings, if this has the same mechanics as the first one, ill keep it a solid five.  Rating is subject to change."

        "I absolutely love this game...And I saw a small easer egg in it as well!!! I am a big Stranger Things fan and when I caught the green frog called HOPPER(sounds familiar?)and I looked at his bio I saw that it said that his fav toy is a FLASHLIGHT, which Hopper uses in the Upside Down, his fav food if coffee, and Hopper is well known for his 'Mornings are for coffee and contemplation' quote and it said that the frog's life is getting STRANGER and STRANGER! Like come on it has to be a Stranger Things easer egg....like if u agree. Other than that i really like the game it is so cute and the bunnies are adorable!😍",
        "I really like this app and I have fun playing it :D I love the concept of collecting pets while running and it motivates me to collect all the pets I can possibly get! However I have a problem. When I first open the app it's all fine and it loads and I can play. However the moment I close the app then open it again it won't load. It'll just stay on that screen with the tiger and panda. I tried undownloading and downloading again and it worked when I first opened the app but when I close out it won't load the 2nd time  I opened the app.",
        "This game is so much fun! And I never really got to play subway surfer, but lots of people say this is Animal Jam's version of it. So if your like me this game is EPIC so you should really download it! Also if you like stranger things the frog hopper,(familiar name huh?) Likes flashlights (which Hopper uses a lot), also likes coffee (like Hopper in the morning), and his bio says: It's seems like almost every day Hopper's life gets stranger and stranger. (Stranger Things Easter Egg!)",
        "Hello! Can you please get back to me with my question? I have been playing this game for only two days and already have lots of pets tagged ❤. Let me say, this game is so cute, fun, and addicting! Right now I have been trying to figure out what my friends time zone is so I changed the time and time zone,  and I thought all was well. Unfortunately, when I got back onto Dash Tag I still had my unlocked pet, Smoky, as my character but it gave me the tutorial pop up. When I closed the game's tab and reopened the game, it had Sparky and I had lost all my coins, gems, and pets. Please help, it would be appreciated! Thanks!",
        "In my opinion this game is better then animal jam. And I play animal jam 24/7 literally everyday. I tottaly recommend this game because it's not online like animal jam. But there is one thing you could improve. People are paying REAL money for things that aren't even real. At least lower down the prices in animal jam and dash tag? Thank you.",
        "This is a very fun game. :) So addicting! And very frustrating sometimes! If you do not have fast reflexes, this game will train you. Lol! The controls are simple and easy, but the game is challenging. Love it!  P.S if you are letting a little kid play there are in app purchases. And the game is cleverly made so it gets harder and harder to 'tag' other pets, possibly convincing you to buy a pet from the game store instead, with real life money."

        "First off, I LOVE the graphics. Games with graphics like these always catch my eye. Amazing and easy to understand gameplay, but it's always enticing and strategic. One problem is definitely the campaign. There's just not enough. Unless I'm missing something, there's only the first 4 chapters. The p2w aspect is relevant, but it's absolutely a game I can see myself playing. Also, there's no way to tell what certain effects do. For example, I didn't know what poison did until I could see something that happened that didn't normally. Some cards are better than others, but I think the balancing is well done. Great job and keep up the good work!",
        "Hi. I love this game. But I think the progression is too slow. There is not much point fighting battles because your rank won't be budging at some point, and the amount of gold given is so so little? Also, I think the quests' cooldown takes too long. 10 hours per simple quest? I feel keen to continue playing this game, and perhaps spend on it. But I wish to see some improvement in the progression first. For instance, adding campaign modes (like 200 stages perhaps), increasing quest rewards, or decreasing quest cool down. Thanks developers :)",
        "The core mechanics of Stormbound are excellently wrought, full of enjoyable depth. I'd give this a 5/5 if not for the necessary evil of monetization. Advancement feels less a matter of skill and deck composition, but more of sheer amount of gold used to upgrade cards.  Battling through the ranks isn't coming face to face with more skilled players - simply more invested.",
        "Excellent isometric strategy card game. Usually I don't like these card collection games but this has a very simple unique deck creation system with 4 unique factions. The \"p2w\" element is strong in the game but enjoyable even if you don't pay for upgrades. Quests and adverts make up a little of the shortfall but in the lower levels it's not super noticeable. I'd recommend you give it a go.",
        "Great game. Beautiful, if not repetitive graphics. Gameplay is pretty easy to pick up, but overall satisfying. There is definitely a pay to win wall if you don't get lucky with your initial packs/first rare ruby deck.  My advice - always buy fusion stones as soon as they come up in store. After your first 25 ruby pack, save up for the 50 one.",
        "It's an amazing game with the possibility to be really, really good. As of now there just aren't enough cards to see too much variation in rank 20 and below, and if you have a legendary card you basically win the game. Aside from that, it's great so far and I can't wait to see it grow."

Only issue it keeps freezing up on me as a new player to this game. I hope I don't have to uninstall it as  its the best came I've come across that I have truely enjoyed. To many games on Google play with kiddie themes. This one is just what I've been looking for. I 💖💖💖💖 it. But if it keeps freezing up I'll have no choice but to uninstall it. How sad that would be.",
        "Game is not fun at all. You spend too much time looking for stuff that it won't give you, not to mention that you need to match 5 gems to get any kind of special gem unlike other match 3 games where you get a special gem when you match 4 or more gems. If they change that I will be willing to give it another try. But until then I'm uninstalling the game and won't reinstall again.",
        "Great game, nice to play. But too many instructions to play makes this game BORED. Waste a lot of time. Sorry to say, I just uninstall.",
        "It is ok and worth a download. I am at level 36. The first 10 levels took two hours, then it got hard to make progress.  This is greedware requiring many $100s to play very long. The initial game plays over an hour, then becomes tedious and time-consuming. It is fine to play when on the toilet in the morning, and that seems appropriate. Mostly, this is just another match three game with excellent graphics and a modest story. Skip all the side games, those just waste resources prompting you to buy time or resources for real cash.  Never waste jewels to keep playing as there are unlimited replays only requiring you to wait for more energy to slowly but for free to build up for the next day's 15 minutes of play. The rewards for playing daily go at least for a year, so it takes a long time to finish.",

        "To become a 4.5 game or better I think the material and points after beating a level should count for something. It would boost all other aspects of the game greatly.just a thought ....."

Is there not that much to the storyline? Does it only last one day? If you want to improve I would keep it daily (i know it's hard). Like mystic messenger it had a story line and times and things like that. It would be great if you could do that to this game!",
        "So, it's 4 because I thougt the game was going to be longer. After I talked to all of the members, no notification comes up anymore after a fee days, and restarting it is not that fun. I wish this game could be longer.. 😅 But I still LOVE it.💗💗💕👌",
        "The texts are cute and the phone calls are amusing if you actually understand korean. There's a few audio clips that could have been used from their audio logs because they often speak lovey dovey to us that would've been less awkward for those of us who actually understand what's being said",
        "I L. O. V. E IT!!! lol it was so satisfying when the member chatting with... It a good imagine 😂i never knew this kind of game really do exist like... Gaving bta chatting with and full compliment from them... I might died soon... How can u ever think about making this game.",
        "So first thank you for creating this masterpiece lol, but as other ARMYs Saïd previsouly, it will be so much better if thé storyline is longer , like to update and all... I know it's really hard, but i promise you that if you'll improve your game, u will get so much more downloads bc it's all we need.. But again thank you for creating it"

To start, the game provides you with mediocre heroes and expect you to play through the game like a pro.

        "Well I've played this game since it lunched and I love the game but I will give it 2 stars because after every update I am getting ridiculous amount of lag that it causes the game to become unplayable. I can't even land on the ground anymore 7 of 10 matches it locks me in the air and I cant even land and the other 3 of 10 I die because of lag. This issue become real after season 1 started I didn't have such problem in season 0 and my phone is perfectly fine for this game too. I will give it higher rating after this issue is gone. Thanks",
        "To be honest, i love to play this game . Gameplay and graphics are fine. The bad thing is, there is no apps that are running in my phone's ram yet still laggy. I put my setting in a lower graphics and also off my power saving to maximize and no limits for the speed of my phone. Secondly, there is a glitch to this game and i also send a video and pictures to prove, through email. Still no feedbacks, do you really manage your emails for feedbacks and troubleshooting? This is one of my hatest that developer is not checking the player's feedback that's why there is no improvement. Fix this asap or else if there is another game that are good more than your game, it's your lost. Sorry if i have a wrong grammar. Thanks.",
        "I got some problem. My device cannot see the 'ground' when its near enough. It span at least for 1 or 2 km and i can see through the 'ground' i can also see trees, bushes, stones and buildings on top of high ground which usually blocked by ground. And that make matters more worse, u can see players walking around on top of hill when im from the bottom",
        "First of all. It's an excellent game compared to other survival games amongst its categories. However, I experience an insane amount of lag for the first 10-15 mins inside the game!  Definitely unplayable! It takes a huge amount of luck to survive in this type of frustration. Please fix this issue real soon!",
        "Good game .... For your information I have Redmi note 4 (4 GB ram) .. Sometimes it works AWESOME but sometimes it lags like hell.. the player cannot move from the position in the game. The player keeps coming back to the same position.... don't know why it happens sometimes, otherwise AWESOME game ...but please netease ... PLZZZZZZ fix this and plz let pc server and mobile server play together in one match, like the fortnight mobile game has done it....... It will increase the interest and fun..!!",
        "Your game lags way to much that it made my phone glitch out. Please fix your issues. This is not fair for me to lose due to your inability to moderate a game you created. If you don't fix it then please remove it from the marketplace. Until you fix this it's impossible to play"

Also, when I paid to have the ads removed, I discovered I still get bombarded by ads whenever I try to take a \"second chance\". It's a fun game if you can ignore the haptic feedback issue and don't buy the paid version.",
        "The game itself is fun. However the game has been ruined by the amount of ads. There's ads on every single screen of this game. They even put ads in the pause menu. There's an ad that actually covers part of the game while you are playing. Ads are to be expected in free apps but when you put that many it ends up chasing people away.",
        "I love the game but there are some glitches. It does like to freeze, but you don't lose your place when you have to restart it.   I have had this happen a couple of times in tge past week. While I'm playing it'll just end the game. I was so happy to have made it as high as I was, the balls were coming out if the top, nothing on the top level, then it ended the game-while in motion. I didn't want to start over at 1 again. :(",

        "I absolutely love this game but you guys need to ease up on how many crystals you need to build your wells or either that let us mine our own on the big island. It is taking FOREVVVVER for those zombies to mine so why not let us mine the big island ourselves. It would also be a humongous help to all us players of this game if you would put in a daily bonus wheel where we could spin it and earn zombie bucks and other things. Other than that this game is awesome. ☺ You need guys need to find a way to let us earn zombie bucks or let us buy them with our own coins we earn ourselves.",
        "When i firxt started playing this game, i loved it, was adxicted and found it enchanting...now it is just irritating.  The tools needed for progression afe too slow to generate and hard to come by.  Everything cool costs money now and it is just not fun anymore...enjoy the first three islands though.  Dont bother with side quests you wont have time to generate enough tools to finish before it expires.  I made it up to the uninhabited izle but im done with this.  Would rather buy for one set price and enjoy.",
        "Way too expensive. No way to play well or make progress without shelling out a ton of money. \"Zombucks\" (in game currency) to USD ratio is pretty low to begin with, but the value of those Zombucks is very low in game. So not worth it. There is also a long delay when switching locations, which you have to do a lot, and sometimes it takes 1 to 2 minutes. No way to play quickly.",
        "The creativity has left the game. The only tasks that we have to complete are cutting down trees or rocks. We used to have to make potions and  build things etc. It's not fun anymore. We use up all of our water wells for lame tasks. I used to love the game, now I barely play it at all.",
        "Love this game but it has a few issues, like  not getting my free brains or spins in theatre when I watch an ad!! This happens frequently and is very frustrating. I would estimate that the game owes me at the very least about 100 free 3 hour brains and 50 free spins! It takes too long to switch between islands and Crystals are not very abundant, there needs to be more to mine and more ways to get them!!!",
        "Love this game. Have been playing it for 2 years. I think that there should be a way to get more amethyst and aquamarine and pine cones. Keep up the good work.  This is the only game that I spend money on, which has been a lot for someone on disability."

My complaints are: the sound design is awful, it's very low quality; the music doesn't go for very long before it loops; the saw level doesn't have any good skins. Otherwise it's quite addictive, plays best with the sound off and the Wi-Fi so you don't get the ads (which aren't too frequent, but they're there).",

Expect to pay $100 a month AT MINIMUM on in-game purchases just to be relevant but you'll still end-up being bullied by a few of the top players. At least they got that part of the game right, gold is King. WB games are deff Lannisters. Three-eyed-raven is the most common hack but you'll have to pay for that as well. Devs are quick to remove posts from WB forums that aren't favorable, so don't expect much support or help. I'm pretty much guaranteed an auto response to even this review like all the others. Stay away. Go play Clash Of Clans. Or any other app that hasn't been so horribly hacked.",

        "This is a great game... You should play it if you like gymnastics and if you are board,You   should download this game... Is very fun... I liked it... But it still needs a bit more to improve.. I would love it even more if you had more stuff.. And if you didnt had to pay for anything  at all.. Also, please just open the spa and the other stuff you cant get unless you pay!",
        "Need to open up the other 2 events, it can get boring only doing floor and uneven bars. This is a fun game but need more options to keep the player engaged. For charging $10.00, we should have full access.",
        "I downloaded this game for my little sister and the first thing she said was that there are way too many adverts and I agree because whenever she clicked on say the dress up or nail salon or gym and adverts would always come up. The game also lags too much even though she has a brand new IPad. However at this time I would not recommend this game. My sister said that she would play the game again if you reduce and have a limited amount of adverts. As well as the advert problems the game keeps telling me to buy everything and it pops up every time I think when you press the 'X' button it shouldn't show again. Please fix this now. As much as my sister loves this game the adverts really annoy her. Would not recommend this game!!",
        "This is from my daughter, \"I like the game but there's some things about it I kind of don't understand. Some of the controls are a little difficult like the one where you have to tap 1 or tap 2 when she's practicing. And its fun. Some of it I like a lot.\"   This is from me, \"the app is annoying until you buy it. It downloaded a ton of icons (ads for other games) to my picture gallery without informing me. My daughter likes the game a lot and it's fun, but a bit intrusive with the free version. The gameplay is good overall.\"",
        "Love everything about this game!!! At first I was skeptical, but then once I started playing, I fell completely in love with it!!!! The only downside of the game is that I am waiting for the other challenges to open so I can compete. Other than that, this game is great overall...5⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐",
        "I think u should have all four slots open to play on  so you can improve on your skills. It gets boring just playing the two apparatus. How much longer do we have to wait"

        "Its an alright game and i advise people to play but would be better if people who walk by your clubhouse could be mugged to get more money and maybe sneak attacks would be good so you might be able to take some money without anybody knowing and when people are bringing cigarettes to california you could intercept the vans. Overall great game",
        "This game has so much potential to be an awesome game except for one factor, you require way yo much real money to move ahead. This truly is a pay to win, change that and the amount of people downloading this game will remain playing imo.",
        "Really like the game and could be a great game. I would rate higher but there are a few issues. First issue I see is it shouldn't cost so much to train more bikers. When you take over territory most of, if not all, the money you gain has to be spent on replacing the bikers you lost. The reward should be higher or the cost of training more bikers should be lower. The other issue I see is the goals section. A lot of them have too many requirements to reach the goals. Make the goals simpler. Also they are not set up in a way to help you progress in the game, they are pretty much random or the goal can not be reached until you are much further in the game. For instance, one goal is to get some properties to level 5. Once you complete that the goal jumps to make properties level 30. That's a huge jump and somewhat disheartening. It's kinda ridiculous to jump from lvl 5 to lvl 30. It takes way too long to go from 5 to 30 and will prolly make a lot of ppl stop/not want to play the game. Improve the goals section and make the rewards better and it will help make the game more successful.",
        "Needs a little more detail when battling. And instead of being in one place being able to ride or walk around but other than that I like the game",
        "Didn't like it at first but if you can afford to buy coins a lot more fun. Seals matchups for New York are complete b.s. though",
        "Great game. Cost alot.  Definitely more fun when you have alot of coins.   But bikers do cost way to much. There needs to be an adjustment there."

I can't help it but to roll my eyes to the right to see the upcoming note. Make it in the middle or something which is easier compare to the right side. Lvl4 is hard to go with the stupid position of the upcoming note",
        "I loved this game and found it very fun. As someone who is currently learning Java, I can vouch that it's not as easy as it may seem, to make a full fledged game like this. I appreciate that the developer would not overflow it with ads but instead make it a choice to see ads in exchange for in game benefits. I think this game should get more attention",
        "I'm an avid music gamer and I have to say for a mobile game it's graphics and choice of music is very nice. However, the reason I don't give it 5 stars is I was expecting the nodes that you collect or other gamplay aspect to be in tune with the music, like say button pressing games like tap tap sonic etc where you press the button in time with the music. The fact this game doesn't do that is a little off putting and I'm not sure how much I would play this game for that reason. Maybe they will implement this in later updates. The option to buy almost everything with in game currency rather than real money is a bonus, give you reason to play it more because you know you can unlock songs etc without forking your own money. Overall though still a good game!",
        "This would get 5 stars but I tried to restore purchases as I have previously purchased 'The Avicii' and I have installed the game after a very long time and tried to restore purchase  (I have before) and did not get my ship. One very disappointed user",
        "It's a good game, obviously an upgrade from the original, just feel a bit bothered with some of the minor changes.  The fact that on the list of things to collect is only 2 items long instead of 4  That after about the 5th one collected, every item just appears on a formation instead of being spread.  And that you don't get power ups while playing anymore.  And why is addicted to you not here?",
        "I like the game especially because there aren't many like it right now. Though it would be nice to see an update that lets you use other songs too. Even though it's avicci's app I mean the songs do get repetitive after playing for a long time"
