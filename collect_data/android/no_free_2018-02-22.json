      'I love this game. Every game I\'ve had, I played for a week or so, and uninstalled. But this one? Ive had for almost 6 months. Been playing every single day. Finally reached legendary 32, I\'ve unlocked everything. I love the VIP subscription and upgrades it gives you. I would like atleast one new vehicle option every month or so. Or at least a new adventure spot. Making a modded version of the rally car would be fantastic. Also, an upgrade on the formula car where it doesn\'t almost dead stop after it lands from a big air.',
       'Superb game! Too bad, the elements of hate like to hack good things and cause frustrations. For this reason, constantly run constant updates. I wouldn\'t mind paying through my rather expensive data to diffuse the damage by these bored, small prick nincompoops! Africaüòùüòùüòù',
       'Pretty good game the Ads are insane and they want a ton of money per month to get rid of them. Seems to be the way all the games are going. For the Chinese new year could have mad a tuk tuk I think it\'s called a mini taxi. Or something cool for China.',
       'Alot of fun but needs new maps and vehicles. Wayyy overdue for some new stuff.  Update: since the latest update I was very disappointed to see that they nerfed the magnet. Still waiting to see new maps and vehicles',
       'Winter sports is terrible. Board jumps on its own without input. Rider falls off when landing flat. Board stops on its own despite holding down accelator. So buggy its laughable',
       'Loved this game before the updates. It now pushea ads in name of commercial break and there is no way to skip it untill its end. For chest its worth watching long ads but as a push ad this is unacceptable. Uninstalling sh**' ,

      'In my humble opinion, this game is truly a work of art and talent. This game can be used by people of all skill levels, due to the variations of complexity and difficulty within each pixel art piece. And it\'s just bursting and overflowing with hundreds, maybe even thousands of art pieces. There are hours of fun and relaxation awaiting you, and what a way it is to pass the time. Even better, it is appropriate for ages of all kind, including small children.Overall, I recommend this to anyone willing, for this is truly glorious.',
       'I love this game! There are so many pictures to color! This game will keep me occupied for hours! I just love how creative they are! But one question...Why do more pictures come by and take the place of my new colored ones? Like, why do more pictures come by everyday? It\'s kind of frustrating to color the new ones and then more appear the next day. Please fix, or stop the glitch. Overall, great game.‚ò∫',
       'Awesome app, its oddly satisfying and can either be really challenging ir really easy. Its constantly update with new pictures to do, and already contains probably hundreds lol, if dont 75+ and in saving the really detailed ones for last. If there even is such a thing. But, i think a counter for how many blocks of each color are left would be a really awesome alteration. There are many strategies to use when you do a color by number. So a counter for how many blocks of the selected number are left, it would be such a life save.this game has taken enough of my life already as is lmao',
       'Good but ¬£4 is a lot to not quite remove all the add. Some pictures are still locked behind and walls. Easy enough to unlock but for the price id expected all add to be removed. Also really would like the pictures to be sortable by category with more fantasy and space stuff in the complex pictures. Also there appears to be no way to sync pictures across devices. If I\'ve paid ¬£4 I should be able to switch between the phone and tablet at will. Both are android.',
       'Way to many ads, was hard to enjoy. Would have been more bearable If the ads weren\'t 30 seconds each, and played everytime I open/close a drawing. And, to prevent any ads you have to pay. I just want an easy, accessible, relaxing game. And by either making one pay, or making them suffer is not really my idea of "Relaxing". Thank you for your consideration.',
       'This game is really fun and when u play it u won\'t even know how fast the time has gone by. This game has some really challenging photos to colour which I am still working on. The thing that is not really good about this game is that there are lots of adds that pop up every time. Please improve that. Other than that this game is fantastic and I also really love all of the images we need to colour and how there are different modes u can change image after u have completely coloured it. I would definitely recommend this app.' ,

      'I hope you take the time to read.   This game is amazing, and it just keeps getting better. I do wish you would change the video knives to apples or video. Now I have nothing to spend apples on.  But here is what i really wanted to say i really like this company and the games you put out to your users. I\'m newly paralyzed and I been well adapting to my new life and because my hands dont work like they used to these games kept my mind busy and has helped me. I own alot of your games and have spent alot trying to help. I wish I had more to unlock things in time. But Thank you very much.',
       'Deleted all my data with no reason. Had a bunch of Legendaries and Rares that have now been deleted. I put a lot of time into this game, and even bought the ad-free package. If you don\'t want a load of wasted time, don\'t download this app.  Edit- Updated the app and levelled up a bit. The game crashes every time I get a free revive. Still a massive waste of time.',
       'You have to expect some ads in free-to-play games but ads that cause input lag and interrupt gameplay are ridiculous, especially in a game where timing is important. The game also crashes occasionally during the xp increase.',
       'I really do like the game. There are two things that get to me however. Knives should all have individual names other than the boss ones. There are also alot of ads, I do understand they need to make üí∞. Otherwise the game is great.',
       'I bought the remove ads purchase and it screwed me. I still get adds and i still have to watch videos to remain in the same level. I want my money back since the game is the same. DONT BUY THE REMOVE ADS PURCHASE.',
       'Automatically plays ads without consent like every 1-2 minutes. Just anothet greedy developer trying to print money on your expenses.' ,

       'I am addicted to this game but my only issue right now is when you do video boost to gain more. It\'s like there is a video limit or bug.  Reason I say this because after so many videos watched the game freezes and you have to reboot it. Good that I can play without internet too. Yet video boost flaw is my only reason I can\'t give this game a 5 star rat fix the bug in videos boost and 5 star is yours.e' ,

      'I love this game and would have rated it a 5 but suddenly the pause feature isn\'t working and I lost a game that was over 8000 points because I had a phone call. After I unpaused it set me back to zero. So aggravating. Also the 30 second ad for 30 stars doesn\'t show up anymore. Not sure what happened to this game in the last 2 weeks.',
       'This used to be an awesome game. I played it every day! But after the latest update, the ads at the top cause the game to lag terribly and make the ball fall very slowly and the pieces disappear slowly.  I can\'t adjust as needed due to the lag. I\'m unable to play due to this lag. Interestingly enough, when I turn on Airplane Mode thereby disabling the ads across the top, everything runs smoothly like it used to!! I am all for ads to support the developers  but this type they currently have causes severe lag which has rendered the game useless.',
       'I really like this game, especially now that new levels were added and different areas instead of just the daily challenges and up to level 99, but since the update I have to do the daily challenges twice before it accepts that I\'ve done them. Every single day it resets my daily challenges after having just completed the new daily challenge. It\'s irritating.',
       'Sadly, it could\'ve been a fun game if I could actually tap where I wanted to. The tap is off by like a few mm or something. I have to tap above the try again button to actually try again, or else I end up hitting challenges... So during the game play the exact same thing would happen, which makes the game unplayable.',
       'This game was very addictive I used to play it everyday.This new update sucks. Nobody likes so you mise well change it back because you were getting better reviews. I am going no further with this game and deleting. Folks pleaseeeeeeee don\'t waste your time in this game unless your a lonely man or women with 30 cats',
       'It was overall a great game and great  way to pass time but my experience was ruined by the countless ads popping up on the screen. Within the first few minutes of playing the game I got three thirty second long ads. I do recommend this if you don\'t mind ads but I would probably just not waste my time.' ,

      'Veeery enjoyable game! I feel like it\'s advertised too much, but it\'s definitely worth playing. Especially if you love games like Bejeweled!  Some of the levels are unnecessarily difficult to get by. You have to either get lucky, or be some type of strategic genius to pass them within a good time frame. That\'s slightly disappounting. Its too much of an encouragement to use money.',
       'Homescapes is an awesome game, combining the relaxation (and frustration!) of match 3 games with the joy of renovating a fabulous mansion. Throw in the fascinating story line, lovable characters lovely music and stunning graphics (except the kitchen wallpaper lol), I\'ll be playing this for a long time! I\'m working on the living room right now, getting close to level 600. Can\'t wait to see what the new character, Jerry, has in store for us! Thank you Playrix!',
       'I really like this Game so Far. I will play for awhile to See how it Works & If I like it. Absolutely Love Your Game. Play it ALL THE TIME!!! I Must Admit that I Really Do enjoy this Game! Sometimes I find myself Having a Hard Time With Certain Levels. I Could be On that Level for Days or a Few Weeks. I think with Some Improvement that Would make People Play. This Game More. But I Must Say Hat\'s Off to The Developers',
       'This is a good game, but the chances on some parts depends on the arrangement, eventhough you are good at it, the arrangement will still determine your winning.  Please work on the stars being given.   Updated, please don\'t ask for too much stars. Like starting a day needs to have alot of stars and even just cleaning or fixing a stuff',
       'Fun at first but levels become way to hard to quickly and it makes it very hard to advance in the game. U have to beat 2 levels to do one task and some levels u need to play 20 time to get past. Abd with only 5 lives at a time. Makes it kind suck. And frusterating to play. Please make 1 task per 1 level',
       'It\'s actually way better than I expected....  Obviously it\'s advertised a lot but it actually met up to my expectations.  What I once about the game is the fact that you don\'t have to pay real money to get things and that you\'re earning the stars instead of buying or waiting for them to come up.   Combining candy Crush and home decor in the best way possible.  A lovely game indeed' ,

      'Very fun and entertaining. I really like slow paced relaxing games and this is just that. There is no time limit so you can play at your own pace. Also there is minimal ads for a free game which is part of what makes this game so great. Such a great game for killing some time in a waiting room or just sitting at home trying to pass the time. This game truly deserves 5 stars. I love it!',
       'I do enjoy this game but certain levels don\'t give you enough moves to complete the level. The ones you have to match the cubes with the colors makes it impossible to pass when the game doesn\'t give you moves to do so. You waste your moves on areas that doesn\'t give you the opportunity to pass the level and then you don\'t have any moves left before it does give you the moves you need it does get frustrating you get stuck on that level and can\'t pass it. Which will just make you want to unistall the game cause you will never leave that level.',
       'I absolutely love this game. The graphics are spectacular. The characters well they\'re not characters their cartoons they\'re amazing. And the game is fun. My only complaint is that every level is a struggle to get through and it would be nice if occasionally they would make a few of them easier.',
       'You will not believe what I am about you tell you but this game picks and chooses who to charge for rewards. I have screenshots of my partner\'s game, not having to pay for his rewards and I look at my game, getting charged $2.99 everytime I want my rewards. Its messed up and I have deleted the game.',
       'This game is great. I like blasting all the cubes. It reminds me of Super Collapse From back in the day. It is a cute game, with cute graphics and characters. Although I might not play it too much because it doesn\'t require enough thought, it\'s definitely something to play when I feel like relaxing.',
       'Support don\'t want to help when you have an issue. Once they reply you don\'t have an option to reply to them, you have to start all over again and it\'s the same reply about back up to Facebook etc, which I did.... level 170 and I had to start again, don\'t ask for help, they don\'t care!!!

      'Its overall a great game. I like the tracks and the cars. I just wished you could re-earn money by replaying tracks, but put it at half amount that way it gives people that dont want to spend money on the game a chance on singleplayer.  FIX THE LAG because you finish in first and you end up getting second, third or fourth because of the lag.',
       'A simple game that\'s like a modern version of an old school racing game I played. It\'s cool for the most part but it is lacking in the department of how to earn money. I wish your developers could add another way to get money than just multiplayer after you complete the career mode. It\'s also incredibly hard to find parts to cars you want without gems. This is mostly a pay to win game, I know but you already have a ton of ads so why make the game less enjoyable by having only two ways to make money? One is temporary and the other is permanent but you earn so little. I still enjoy the game but consider what I had to say, thank you.',
       'Game is good. Do not even waste your time paying to get rid of ads. They will rip you off. I paid to get rid of them and you still have to watch videos to claim your money that you won. You have been warned. Would have given five stars if it were not for admin stealing money',
       'I am at level 6 and on stage 2. I am noticing that the game is kinda lacking in car part drops. The level progress is fine, the amount that it costs to upgrade vehicles is fine, the fact that you can use gems to unlock cars is fine, but I am not seeing enough car part drops to keep the game from becoming stagnant.',
       'I really like the game, but it is tricky to control the car. Plus I really like the paint, it was a good idea to make stripes and fire as a pattern, but the paints that are with out pattern are NOT good, because at the front of the car is brown and the rest is one colour, so it doesn\'t look nice. Still I really like the game. My friend had a little brother and her little brother gone crazy of this game because he LOVED IT!',
       'Annoying adds. Draining my internet data i dont like it! Every challenges in multiplayer need to watch the adds so you will receive the reward nope that\'s horible. I prefer playing a free game so i don\'t like this kind of game. Its just simple thia is money game!!!' ,

      'Updated review: The issue with account data loss is fixed with the help of the workaround given by Dev team... Loving this game all over again. Yet to test the latest update though. Previous review: Lost my progress since today noon IST. I\'m able to see the progress and acheivements in Google Play Games app but whenever I load the game it begins with the tutorial. Devs, kindly resolve the issue as I loved the game so much...',
       'When I first started a couple of days ago, I made a little progress. Then yesterday all that was lost so I started again and reached much farther away. Today all of it was reset again and I lost all that progress but my old account was restored! Please let me retrieve my second account, I have gone MUCH further in that account starting second time. I had managed to get 4 Level 2 players and few level 3 shards.. I dont wana start from scratch again...',
       'Not like the typical console beat\'em up Tekken but its better than the previous mobile Tekken game from before, more involved than playing rock-paper-scissor system. The \'adventure\' mode is somewhat similar to Tekken 6 where you collect better \'gears\' to improve your character, simple but its fun and thats whats missing in Tekken 7. Game somewhat laggy but being ver0.9, we\'ll see how they will fix it.',
       'If you are expecting something like the old teken stuff I remember on play station. This is not it, it is like any other game where you will need to buy gems etc. It does not remind me of those games other than characters.',
       'The game which no one tests..new bugs every. 2 star Nina in daily challenge is more difficult than the 4 star boss. If the quality is so bad when the game is new. It will only suck more in future. Waste of time and money',
       'I felt very bad, I\'m a great fan of tekken, but this mobile version was nice, i played hard and earned lots of shards, coins, unlocked players, then after restarting the game, your progress is lodt and plays a new game, again you play, and earn, it\'ll be for some.day and then one day it gives you new game, all your progress is lost. It\'s so irritating when you play so hard and everything goes in vain.' ,

      'This "game" is like empty calories. I ingested it ate it up and left hungry.  There is no goal whatsoever to this game. It is a glorified add campaign intended to keep you going on and on with a false feeling of accomplishment in order push ads on you or make you buy perks. Want to double your earnings for 20 seconds? Watch a 30 second ad. Want to improve earnings for four hours. Watch an ad. You get the point. Of course you can buy these perks but why do any of this? The "game" never really does anything whatsoever. No milestones, no real goals, no anything. Well after about 3 hours of game time and the equivalent of add watching time I am off to ingest something with more substance.',
       'AMAZING! I love this game. It is so addicting and a great way to pass time and boredom. I think though for one small improvement you could add a thing where there are like \'mini games\' and you earn coins for that. Using those coins earend in the mini games you spend it on things like watering cans, fences for live stock and more! This was only some suggestions for a bigger game if you can have or make a new game called like farm life or something like that....LOVE IT...',
       'I have seen this as an ad. I thought I should give it a try. It worked out. Before long, I reached level 15. Now I\'m on level 33 and I have 8.448 trillon gold! I automated 100% of my farm!  I\'m already making lots of gold with automating potatoes. Potatoes give away so much gold! Great update!  Keep up the good work! Thanks, Idle Farming Empire! What a good replacement for Farm Away!                  Idle Farming Empire is like the best simulation for farming. I gave the game 5 stars for a reason. I loved the game! Look under the review! There\'re many people rating the game 5 stars. Over 78,800 people did it! Thanks for everything!',
       'I LOVE THIS GAMEE!! It\'s so addicting and once u get used to it, u can\'t stop playing it! It\'s a great time killer and it auto saves (not of u connected to Facebook.) Again, I love this game and I would recommend this game to EVERYONE because it\'s for all ages (unless u are a very serious person) JK LOL! :D',
       'Like so far But, 2 issues. 1- I don\'t Facebook or do any social media so needs to be a way other than ads for those bonuses. 2- daily rewards Don\'t happen. Shows that they were collected but will not activate unless I have enough diamonds. Please fix. Play offline on tablet and hotspot to get daily reward.',
       'Great and addicting game, but with one major bug. I went to collect my idle money and I watched a video too double it (46 billion total). But when I hit the button to collect it, I never got it. All the money dissapeared and I got nothing. What\'s the point of an idle game, if you don\'t get anything for being idle?' ,

      'Awesome Game!! Really I like this game. I dont even have words to describe it. Totally Fantastic... Whatever you say, this is totally cool. But I have a request...please add a column of legendary bikes. Like there is Common, Rares, Epics, and Specials , there should be a column of legendary. Waiting eagerly for the next update. Thanks a lot of making this fabulous game. And I would also like to appreciate the colours and graphics of this game. Thanks to the team for making this game. I advice this game to those who are looking for cool new games. Please install it and have FUN!!!! Dont just look at the pics, install and you\'ll be amazed.',
       'Unless you have 16 hrs a day to put into this game to learn the track you will never have a very high score. Sometimes your vehicle doesnt respond the same as other runs also you may land on your tail and survive and the next time you die its up and down with the control if you keep going or die. And sometimes it tries to flip when you try to take off resulting in a quick death',
       'Great looking game, and good idea. I give it 4 stars because the tracks are not consistent. One time an obstical will work and the next run you hit an invisible bump and die. Also, a lot of the time it won\'t register your flips. These aren\'t huge bugs but considering the gameplay is based entirely upon these two premises, it makes the experience frustrating.',
       'Would and will give 5 star. But would like to see a gem counter. It gets rather tough keeping count.  Also I noticed sometimes that when come across the areas that have the 4-5 flat spiked walls that you have to time just right. When I die and revive they all seem to sync up together making it impossible to go under. I\'ll try and screenshot it next time. All in all great job and awesome game. Maybe a custom map feature for future. Possibly added to the no ads fee. Would be worth it then.',
       'This game is my favorite game ever. The graphics are amazing, the controls are great. I can\'t seem to find anything wrong with this game. Me and my brother love playing it. I also like that it is available on Google Play Store and the Appstore on iPhones. My old phone was an iPhone, and when I got my new phone I was worried that I wouldn\'t be able to play it, but thanks to Ketchapp and Google Play Store, I can still play it!! Also, I would like to suggest that you add a feature that allows you to create your own level, but it\'s not something you have to add, it\'s just something I think would make the game absolutely perfect for me. Then again, you may already have that feature and I haven\'t seen it/gotten to it yet. Anyway, it\'s an amazing game, and I hope Ketchapp keeps making amazing games like this!!! (BTW, Ketchapp games are my absolute FAV.) Thank you!! üöòüòäüöò',
       'This game would be great if it wasn\'t so laggy. Usually I would think it was an issue with phone storage or something, but I am on a new phone (note 8) and have only added a few apps in total. The game was smooth the first day or two but now the speed changes throughout play. The levels become impossible because the clock doesn\'t slow down even though the movement of the bike does.   Great concept and design. Hopefully that can be figured out if it is an issue on their side.' ,

      'i love roblox but i have been having some diffuculties lately 1. when i join a game i havent been able to move but i had found a solution to this just by changing the movement 2. now i have been joining any game and it wont let me move my mice itll just be in the top left corner so can this bug be fixed as i had just bought 400 robux and bloxburg and havent had the chance to play it!',
       'With each *regular update* this app has gotten worse. Now none of the high quality mobile servers can be played because the app can\'t fit that into itself, thus causing a disconnect. My perfectly ok phone was playing this fine until recently, but now the app can\'t even play what little it could to begin with. Just remove the app from the store already.',
       'For some reason roblox stopped working today im on chrome and usely it works but today i tried play roblox and the mouse will not work it goes in the top left corner if anyone knows whats going on tell me please and fix this roblox!!! I love roblox dont want to lose it!! Hopfully you fix this i have seen its not just me but other aswell whats happening. whatever you did inm that update ruined my gameplay',
       'I would\'ve rated this 5 stars if it didn\'t litterally ban NUMBERS, and also it\'s got A LOT of bugs... Can someone PLEASE do something about these things? It\'s still an amazing app but still, please try and fix this.',
       'First of all still very disaponted at the update. If my chromebook is going to stay like this then make and roblox app specifically for chromebooks so that you dont have to put it on the playstore for chromebooks. You put xbox controls on my chromebook and now I dont know what to do because i dont have an xbox controller.  If you dont fix now then just please get off the playstore. I saw other reviews by other who have the same model and I dont think their happy at all and neither am I.',
       'OK SO IT ALWAYS PUTTING NUMBERS INTO HASHTAGS!! HASHTAGS?! WHY? YOU DON\'T NEED TO PUT EVERY SINGLE THING INTO HASHTAGS?!... The games and graphics are really nice though. Keep up the good work. My only complaint is the thing that you guys put numbers into hashtags.' ,

      'Pretty, addicting and intriguing. Love the gameplay so far, and no purchases are required (they help a lot, though). Constant technical issues are a great nuisance, however. Force stop or reboot is usually needed to get the game running, and models occasionally fail to load (playing on a oneplus 5). All in all, thumbs up for a great and non-greedy game, which could use some serious bugfixing.',
       'This is a really nice game. I\'m enjoying immensely.  There is one thing I\'d like to see happen. Every time I collect wood andmstone, the big hand comes on the screen to point at the buildings. Now useful as It was in the tutorial,  I now don\'t need to remind me. Can you get rid of it?',
       'Graphics are really beautiful. Controls work 90% of the time, 10% of it requiring you to tap 2 to 3 times due to it being unresponsive. Gameplay wise, its great at first, then after a while the wait times are too long and there is very little gameplay to fill the time in between voyages.  Overall, great graphics, controls can be optimized, gameplay can be more in depth and varied? I find myself just comin on every hour or so just to collect and set stuff.',
       'Black screen on load. Will not load or go past blank screen. Tried everything and nothing works.   EDIT: After the latest update it is working fine again. Awesome game and very addicting. would be great if had an option to gain resources or something from ships enroute while waiting for them to return',
       'I\'m having one major issue with this game, and it\'s reoccurring. It keeps stating it Error cannot connect, even though my signal has full strength. Come on developers, my provider says that there\'s no problem my end, that leaves only one end possible, doesn\'t it!!',
       'Every time I close out of the app and reopen it there is a flash of the loading screen then it goes black and I can\'t get passed it. I have to uninstall and reinstall the app and it works a few times then the problem persists. Please help me because I really love this game. I play on a note 8. EDIT: The game is no longer playable it just opens to a black screen even after uninstalling and reinstalling, which is why I went from 3 stars to 1 star.' ,

      'So I played it on my iPhone e and loved it. Recently o got a new phone and it\'s am android. I connected to my Nintendo account and loaded it up. My world seem to be it good shape everything there like in my IPhone but when I went to tour only world one was available. I\'m not going to spend another ten dollars to unlock what I already beat so please fix it I wanna keep enjoying this gamr',
       'Love this game and love the nostalgia but there is no way I\'m paying ¬£9.99 to level up on any game ever let alone one where a single tap on the screen is the only player interaction. Even with direction control etc like the old days wouldn\'t make it worth the price being asked.',
       'I have had a very long conversation with someone at the hq and I was talking about the worlds. I bought the worlds on my iPad and downloaded Mario run on this device Android. I ask why my worlds that I purchased on my iPad aren\'t here. They don\'t connect that purchase with Nintendo account. When they connect everything else. I told them I am not paying twice so that brings down the rating for me for this game. But great fun and very enjoyable, but get the linking fixed. Seems a bit of a design flaw',
       'Super Mario run is a great smartphone game it has the very addicting toad rally and remix ten and the simple, but very rewarding controls. The kingdom builder is a good addition but is kinda unnecessary. The only big problem I have with it is that it has to always be online. I give super Mario run 8.5/10 stars',
       'I beat world 1, and I have to pay for the rest of the game? Really? This is stupid.. If you\'re going to have a game you need to pay for, market it as such, not the ol bait and switch. Very deceitful.. At least make a trial game or demo game not lure someone in and then tell them they need to pay to finish the game',
       'I\'ve been playing this game WAY........Before 5/22/17 as my last review states in my prior comment!!.  I paid $9.99 to obtain full access to all worlds! And I\'ve emailed you all with this information,  I\'ve sent proof of purchase!! And all other things required to confirm my statements! But I continue to go ignored as if I never mentioned an issue!.. For some strange & frustrating reason I\'m unable to regain access to the entire tour which I completed not long after I paid the cover fee of $9.99 to do so!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! And I\'m NOT wiling to pay for that again!!that\'s certainly an option I\'m NOT willing to apply.  Please repair this ongoing issue.. It will be appreciated beyond words' ,

      'Good job marketing team. I downloaded it cause an Instagram ad said only 1% can pass level 9.. I beat it on my first try. Boring game and disappointing.',
       'Fantastic game but way too many ads. You prompt to watch an ad for extra turn, I watch it and then it crashes waste of time. Really annoying.',
       'There is a bug. I cant see the tremendous amounts of ads in your game when i am in airplane mode. Please help so i can watch these unstoppable ads without reward. Thank you',
       'Way too many ads and they are so sensitive. the game should be to try to close the ads without you opening it.',

      'This game was great until the most recent update now I dont play as much. Only being able to save 25 cupcakes when before tgere was no limit IS terrible! I\'ve purchased boost to pass a level & several times when I\'ve used them the game freezes so I lose the boost. I contacted customer service got a generic response & no refund but they want me to rate their service ü§î no thanks! I loved the game before but not so much now!!',
       'Would of gave full marks but on a few cooking appliances when I tap on it doesn\'t work. Second I think it would help if you could carry money over from one country to another and convert currency. Some of the levels are hard to achieve and you don\'t earn enough power ups and spoons to help you through the levels plus restore lives take ages. Customer waiting is to quick.',
       'It is a great game and very fun to play but just needs a little more to it. The one thing I can\'t figure out is why do we keep getting coins if we can\'t use them to purchase anything after you get all the upgrades on your ingredients. There should be a use for them or stop giving us coins in the rewards of each day. I wish there more things to buy or if the coins could be transferred to the next level or something. Okay thanks. P.S. I was just enjoying this game until you guys decided to cut my cup cakes down to 25 only so that means I have been saving mine only to know that after I use them up I can only get 25 at a time well that sucks and I hope you change that back if not my time with this game has come to an end.',
       'Was a great,  fun game,  but now with the new Update things will not download.  I\'ve sent emails to them and nothing has change.  I did receive an email back asking to rate their and of course I told them you don\'t want me to rate something I never received!!  Can\'t open game,  this issue has gotten worse!!üò°',
       'I LOVE IT!!  Very addictive & challenging. My only problem is that I accidentally uninstalled it while removing games from my tablet that I no longer play. I had just reached level 50 so now I have to start all over again. Fortunately this is one game I don\'t mind doing that with!!',
       'It is actually fun till you run out of lives. I made it to level 20. Then it is required that you pay money to play further or watch 1 advert for each additional life. Gets old real fast. Oh and they keep asking you to rate them while you are still in your beginning levels  over and over and over hoping they will get the great rating while you are still having fun b4 your have to pay to aquire more lives. They give you plenty to get their rating, then when you lose them the game sucks and they want your money. Happy playing.' ,

      'this game is a thousand times better than agar.io in my opinion! It\'s so much easier to get onto the leader board. Every time I play I get onto the leader board. It\'s just so addicting and I can\'t get enough. Everyone in my family loves it too. Creating your own skin is a great option as well. My only complaint is that the \'play online\' option is very laggy, and if you fix it would be much appreciated. Thanks for a great game, from sin√©ad, ella, lauren, mollie, shane and ollie üòäüòä',
       'I\'ve recently upgraded from cubot to galaxy s7 and unfortunately the game is not working properly like it did on the old cubot phone. The screen gets stopping and it\'s impossible to play. I\'ve tried uninstalling and changing Wi-Fi settings but nothing worked. Other than that the game is sick! Love it,my kids love it and it\'s fun to play.',
       'Should allow us to be able to control the speed with a bar level instead of the button. Should make online controllers like offlines. Faster and more sensitive to move. And add a special rare star that floats around the screen rarely that doubles your size by eating it. No matter how big you are. That would be interesting.',
       'So I think just about everyone has heard of this game... Buuuuuuut there are some newbies here so I\'ll explain. Its a multiplayer game and It\'s in my opinion that It is probibly #2 best game I\'ve ever played. Great concept and I like to get creative on makeing a snake/worm thing. A+ grade. üëåüëç',
       'Playing this game is total fun. But It would be more Awesome if there will be some sounds & a pause button maybe. One more thing, somebody tell me how to BOOST the Slither because everyone is boosting except meüò≠üòåüò∂üôÑüòìüòëüò´üôÉ',
       'I\'m highly addicted to this game. It\'s a thousand times better then agar.io in my opinion and it\'s really cool that you get to create your own skin. The only downer is that I just wish there was some music because you start to get a bit bored after a while.This game is NOT a waste of time, and everyone needs to download it to experience the awesomeness!' ,

      'Absolutely love all of the geometry dash games! Colors and graphics are awesome, game play is challenging but fun, and the music is perfect! Only thing I can complain about is that I wish all of the levels from these free versions were in the full version. I own the full version and would much prefer to be able to play these levels without ads and with all of the cool characters and colors I have unlocked. Other than that though, amazing work you guys, keep it up!',
       'Woah. WOAH. WWOOAAHH!!! Oh. Another Chllenging game but thhe only thing i like in it tha it has Dantdm\'s Old Intro at the press start! Wow. I am pro at Geometry Dash Games and another one oh yea and there is Sub Zero(MK) name there like i saw them quickly. And i would say for the creator: plz. Creator keep the good work! Ok!!! And make more Geometry Dash and can u make something more fun for more people to play with!!!',
       'Oh my god... This is the best geometry dash free game I have ever played,  and is almost more fun than the full version.  Robtop, you have regained full respect after what happened with meltdown. I\'m just speechless, at the amount of work that was put into these three levels, going from the camera angles to the animations. This game is not like meltdown,  which is three short amateur levels, but with three long, harder levels. This game is like a preview to 2.2, and I know it\'s going to be good.  We\'ll done, Robtop! Keep up the great work!',
       'This game is awesome!! Just one thing... You might want to fix Power Trip, because if you miss the gravity pad in the robot part it\'s pretty much an insta-win. I don\'t know if it was meant to be there but if it wasn\'t, you should probably put some spikes there or something.',
       'This just blows my mind... one thing I would like to see in the future is some rob-top made tutorials on how each editing items works in the game so other players can feel more comfortable making their own levels and not be intimidated by all the other fan made levels... I am one of those players who is intimidated by the other fan made levels... This could help young and creative minds to create their own levels their friends can enjoy. Thanks 10/10',
       'I love this game so much.  Some of the effects and colours added into the game make it so fun to play and watch. Its challenging and thats what makes it fun. Its not like one of those games that are so easy you finish it in an hour. This game takes time and effort. Also the backround music is pretty cool. Especially nock em with headphones. controls are very easy to use, just tap to jump and usually hold to use the vehicles, so easy! This game is perfect and absolutely fun. I would highly recommend downloading geometry dash subzero.' ,

      'I like the mobile version better than the PC version because the touch screen works better than the mouse. I also love the food machine you can get for 12 diamonds. It\'s pricey but we\'ll worth the purchase. I kinda wish the pace of customers was a little bit slower so I had more time to prepare the food. I do wish however that I didn\'t need so many gems to upgrade every little thing. Or if I do need gems then maybe they could be easier to get instead of only getting 5 every time you level up. So, decrease the pace of customers and make the gems easier to get',
       'Love this game. Easy to play. My daughter and her partner both downloaded after playing mine.  When I first downloaded the game I didn\'t need to have the internet on. Don\'t know what happened but I know have to be on the internet to start the game but can then turn the internet off. Otherwise happy with it. So many restaurants to buy. And you can get ahead with the casino and keep playing everyday to get more money and gems. Thumbs up from me.',
       'Omg I have just realised that it was 1 year ago since I wrote that! So I\'m going to write a new one!. I love this game so much it has such good graphics and I recommend this game for any age I am addicted to this game and I think that you should definitely get it. It is a great game and I love it! So what are you waiting for go ahead and download it right now!',
       'this is a very well made game with excellent graphics and challenging play. It is however very money focused. The beginning levels are structured to encourage upgrades which at first are reasonable. Each later stage requires more diamonds to complete. The so called \'challenges\' are Impossible to complete without upgrading every implement so are essentially impossible for free play. Players beware!',
       'I love the way this game plays, and it plays like a dream. The grafics are wonderful, but there is just one flaw. The diamonds. You have to either play for a long time to earn more diamonds, and you can, or buy them with real money. And the game causes you to spend more diamonds than you can earn. From the atmosphere itself, to the food, and the appliances. Unless you have a lot of time and patience, or have the money to buy diamonds, this game might grind your nerves.',
       'Very nice graphics and addictive. The best thing is that it does not force you to pay for better progress. Ads are not noticeable. It provides a very comfortable playing environment.  It could be even better if the food can be more sensitive to touch. I always fail to grab those cooking food causing them to be burnt. Nice game overall though.' ,

      'Me and my son have had fun with this game and made an attempt to collect all characters. The game is set up so you can not earn all of the characters but have to buy the last couple in a cash grab. It would be fine if they we\'re only available for real money but the game gives the illusion that you can win them in a chest. One that we have spun over 50 times without success',
       'Great timewaster! There are a lot of characters to earn and you don\'t need to spend real money to get them, so that\'s a plus. However, rated it a 3 cuz there are sooooo many ads. I get that ads generate the revenue to keep a good game free but an ad populates for literally every action. Win a game=ad, lose a game=ad, go to the settings=ad, change the volume=ad... ok the last one is fictitious but it really seems like that\'s how it works',
       'Love the game, its fun, addictive, and challenging. It makes you actually think before you do anything. The ads really are a bit much, being that after every single round in a tournament there is one. Also, one major thing, keep up with the updates. IOS users seems to have gotten an update with new characters and pvp mode even but not android',
       'The game is simple to immediately start playing and fun. I shouldn\'t rate a game based off of this but, these pop up adds are tremendously common. Adds are essential so that the app can support itself but to have an add after every single play and then have an add to open a chest? Really? That\'s a bit much, especially, when the adds are not easily skippable and even force you to the download screen of the add. The game is simple, fun, and has witty, silly, and quirky characters. But the adds are a bit much.',
       'The game itself is enjoyable and the controls are quite simple. Very intuitive. But Jesus Christ on a frosty log, the ads are way to much. After every round, ad, want your prize? Ad. Wanna do anything in the game? Enjoy the ad. Jesus guys, I don\'t mind ads and I understand that\'s how you make money, but you shouldn\'t have to watch an ad to get your prize for winning... Come on.',
       'Everything else is great, EXCEPT the amount of ads... I love the game, but I don\'t want to keep turning on and off airplane mode so I can actually enjoy it.  Edit: there are ads after I go into settings and more information, which doesn\'t leave the app!? Seriously? And the "messages" are all more ads for other apps too, lol. Bro calm down with the ads. This is why I\'m now uninstalling.' ,

      'Love it! I play it all the time! You can play online or offline - online gives you a chance to revive. Has course like game play or continuous. No pause which is understandable but kinda sucks. Once you get the hang of the controls it becomes  addicting. Would like to see more land and background options... maybe on the next update??',
       'Entirely too many ads.  Look I understand as a free app you have put time into this and some money back is nice.  But this is way over board with the ads. The game is fun, easy, and plays well. However it\'s not worth paying to remove ads. Ads are a necessary thing if you are looking looking to make money from your creation, however this mean is just ignorance and the main reason I uninstalled.',
       'tl;dr: Good game mechanics.  Ads are the worst ever, and the pay to remove them doesn\'t work. Would recommend if you don\'t mind watching long ads constantly.   Review: The base game is awesome. I love the mechanics and graphics. If you want a solid game, this is it.   However. I REFUSE to give this a good rating for 2 reasons.  1) The amount of ads is outrageous. I get they need to keep the lights on, but come on I don\'t want a 30 second video every time I "die" 2) I was willing to pay for the game to get rid of the ads. Well, don\'t do that. It doesn\'t actually work. I restarted my phone, reinstalled it, and did the force stop to confirm it wasn\'t a minor glitch. If you\'re going to have a pay to remove ad feature, make sure it works. Luckily I was able to get a refund from Google.',
       'I gannruntee this won\'t make it on the review list but oh well. I just uninstalled this game because I paid the $2.49 for no ads and it doesn\'t work. Don\'t waste your time or money. I really like the game bit there are way TOO MANY ads and when you try to hit home to bypass the ads the game freezes up. So until they fix the problem I WILL NOT download this game. I\'ll find another one similar.',
       'A good concept, I love the gameplay and have a highscore of 589. But the ads are way too common, it\'s always a 30 second or 15 second ad after every death; It\'s like our motivation to keep the ball going is just so we don\'t have to watch an ad. Plus, sound would be good to add for Dune.',
       'It sucks. It\'s not supposed to be an ad display app with a game thrown in every once in a while. I opened the game, it showed an ad. Played the first time, it showed an ad and asked me to rate it. Played a third time, it showed an ad and asked me to rate it so I did. 1 star since I can\'t even find out if the game is any good because of the damn ads and whining for ratings.' ,

      'This is an awesome game. A few suggestions though: Think it will be more fun if players play at the same time. Also why is fight list 2 not on the Play Store? I also think you should consider more international answers for questions that have a broader scope like  the one about Coca-Cola brands. All the ones available in my country were not recognized as answers. Great game !!!',
       'Great game, fun to play.  Only things I don\'t like are the fact there are so many ads and not just short ads long videos which is really annoying, and second and probable the biggest issue I found is that there is no single player option! I have to have like 10+ games going to enjoy playing if my partners arent online or play often. Would be much better if there was single player option',
       'Great game, I totally love it. I don\'t mind the ad but I get annoyed of too many questions of Selena Gomez/Taylor Swift/Beyonce/Ariana Grande etc top hits. How about the legends..like David Bowie, Prince, Foo fighters, Guns n roses, Smashing pumpkins.. other than that, u all admins really rock!!  Edit: So I finally get questions like hits by David Bowie, Oasis..so cool. Well done fight list!! And they do consider our suggested answers!!‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§',
       'It\'s fun. It\'s actually more informative that I thought it would be. It kind of opens up you mind and is an amazing pass time stimulate. However I feel it would be more beneficial in and educational sense if you had more of an opportunity to review the answer list through the app. It\'s actually something I look forward to when the round is over.  So you\'re not just learning something from what you and your challenger have contributed as far as answers, but the game itself has also done it\'s part. Other than that, totally awesome.',
       'Ads are too long and frequent but other than that, it\'s good.  It could do with more English stuff though. I have no idea what gym chains are in the U.S or discount stores or supermarkets for that matter but I do know England. Some rounds I can\'t take part in and end up losing the game because if it. Also, a lot of English synonyms aren\'t recognised either. I\'d enjoy the game even more if I could relate to all of it.',

      'The whole game is very amazing. Listening to the soundtracks can make you get motivated on playing the certain level until you pass it. The game can sometimes make you rage a little, and the colors can be little bit to neon and flashy for you. The whole point that I think about this game is that it tries to make it very challenging. The colors are beautiful in my opinion. The ads can me sometimes annoying, but you can turn on the airplane more so that they won\'t annoy you too much. Keep up the great work, RobTobGames!   C√∏okie',
       'Its a legit fun game to play but...  For me I get streshed because when I need to do it over again then u  streshed by not doing it...    Its still kind of a good game though..  Also on YT thanks for...   !!!! 2 SUBSCRIBERS!!!!  I know its not alot but I am rlly happy and I\'m thankfully to who subscribed to me on YT :)  My name was galaxy DJ but now..

       'Well, I admit, I\'m addicted to this. The levels are SO FUN, and also quite challenging. Sometimes,yes, I rage, but it wouldn\'t be fun if it was too easy.The animation is sophisticated, the music is AMAZING (my two favorite songs are Clutterfunk and Can\'t Let Go) and they give you a TON of levels for a free trial. I LOVE THIS GAME!!!! Thank you Robtop!!! üôåüòéüòç',
       'It\'s a real cool game, I do recommend playing this game because not is it only fun bit addictive as well. There are loads of levels so you never get Bored but warning ‚ö† the levels do get harder as u go further on. But yeah I do recommend playing this game it\'s super fun, super addictive and i would rate it a 4 star.',
       'Addictive & Fun I think GD Lite is super awesome and addictive. I think it\'s fun because it\'s challenging and there\'s super fun things in GD except hacking because that\'s no fun. Anyways GD is addictive because everyone gets it they beat a level get super happy and boom there into the game. And I\'m super happy because I beat every single level in GD Lite! I hope there could be even more levels!                                                        Challenging levels in GD I think Clutterfunk is the hardest even though I did beat it :D! But the most toghest is       Clubstep, Theary of Everything 2, and the one and only Deadlocked the three demons in GD! GD is awesome!!!!! :D :D :D &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 I love you GD!!!!!! üòéüòÇ',
       'I like this game but when I tap to jump, it doesnt jump. When I dont tap, it jumps. There\'s a bit too much ads. I like the music and colors. I like how its played and how its challenging. But it does make u rage. The levels r long and when u die near the end, it makes u restart and sometimes, my brother rages.' ,

      'I really want to love this game but the time mechanics in it are just too much. An hour for one game token and most of the maps after the tutorials cost more than one token to play. I have to wait 3 hours to play one round? I really like this game, the merging mechanics are addicting and fun! I find my self between kicking myself for popping something early and getting excited for getting close to going just one more level up, but I almost have to literally forget about the game in order to get any sort of meaningful play time out of this game.',
       'Reason I changed from 5 star rating to 4 stars is before a recent update, you only needed 1 dragon chalice to play any level. Got changed to needing more than 1 on most levels, which wouldn\'t be so bad if they didn\'t make you wait 1 hour to get 1 dragon chalice back. Used to only be a 15 minute wait between chalice\'s. If it goes back to old way......5 stars again! Still a great game',
       'After reaching level 39 my camp game completely erased and I\'m back to level 2. wasted so much time making hearts. .update. I tried to play again. I even have cloud saving my game again. I reached level 30. Suddenly all my dragons are gone. Again. What the hell game! Update: once again  the updated and all my progress is gone. This time om at level 53. I\'m done. The creators don\'t even reply or show that they are listening to the players to come to a solution. I\'m not playing this game again. WASTE OF TIME!',
       'Purchased the 30 day gem subscription. Got the first few days then it stopped. No way to contact support from inside the game, help menu continually crashed. Emailed support from outside the game and received no reply. Hoping Paypal can get my money back. Cute  time wasting game but don\'t spend real money on it.',
       'Love the idea. Would love to have getting gems be a little bit easier without spending money, watch ads or something for gems, since they are required to complete some quests. Also, mine all of the sudden stopped working. Said the hardware in my phone couldn\'t support it anymore. Same phone. So, now I can also no longer play. Bit bummed about that.',
       '2018.02.19 update. Game crashes mid level, when reopen game, doesn\'t start in level, have to start over. Chalices lost, recharge time vs level cost ridiculous. Don\'t always get rewards from special events. Customer service completely absent. Have emailed from their website several times with no response. Game is fun, but such a hassle.' ,

      'So nice to sit and enjoy a game of challenge. Almost as much fun as chess, but easier to carry. Great way to relax while waiting for the zombie apocalypse or the bus to come. Thank-you and keep up the awesome work.  *UPDATE* 17 FEB 2018.  Have started my friends and family trying to get Top Score. No one is really trying as they are all enjoying playing the app to care. Brought a tear to my eye. Once again, "Thank-you"  for a truly  wonderful game.',
       'Great game. Starts easy so you can get your eye in and then gets harder. Fun to play and not so difficult that you give up and uninstal. Ads are over fairly quickly and I like that you can choose to watch some to get extra coins.',

      'Is this game for You? Do you enjoy spending most of the game watching ads? Do you enjoy games that make it impossible to play without spending real money? Do you enjoy being grabbed by the crotch so hard you change genders?  If you answered yes or no to any of these then no this game is not for you. It\'s nothing but a crappy game designed to rake in as much money as possible, rather than making something fun. Forced to watch 30 second ads after each round. Forced to use the currency you earn when you don\'t want too. Enemy power will suddenly jump up 10 fold making spells and goldimpossible to gain without watching an addition 30 second ad. Even if you win and get the key you are forced to watch a 30 sec ad to unlock as if you didn\'t get a key.',
       'It stopped working on my One plus! Help! I was excited about the side games! *********************************** Excellent, addictive fun. I reached shield 135 (level 1154) and it doesn\'t level up any more. Gutted! Still a great game but so sad I can\'t progress any more. No reason why really! Incidentally, good for helping kids with Mathematics.',
       'Concept and gameplay is ok, but, like others have said, there are way too many ads. Also the special spells you can unlock are given to you at random. Have a aituation that drill would be great for? Too bad take explosion.',
       'Fun game but takes forever to get gold to upgrade. The cost to pay for the gems to buy so you can buy gold is really expensive. Not much dynamic to the game. Same stuff on each level just takes longer to bet enemies cause of higher HP.',
       'This game is really good.  The more you play the harder it gets but it is doable and you can watch ads to get you trough without paying.  I am around level 35 & haven\'t spent anything.  It is a hard to put down game.  The visuals are super satisfying,  especially when you get your little bombs kicking butt on the upper side of the enemy and they get faster and faster.  So satisfying!',
       'I wish I read the reviews before I downloaded this "game". Absolutely awful. Seriously, don\'t waste your time. If you like a stupid amount of ads and you are a fan of being bored then go for it.' ,

      'One way to check how much products I have left is by touching the machine and thr corresponding product but sometimes the game will assume  that you are putting the product into production hence it will put the product into production whether you want it or not so it will waste production time. Sometimes the touch is too sensitive. Sometimes the touch is not sensitive enough which forces me to drag the product into the production slot up to 10 ten times just to start production. I know this feedback is not much but maybe an undo button will help. It makes the gameplay million times difference if you  put your players comfort a priority.',

      'Good game however, once you\'ve taken control of all the islands there is little else to keep you interested. I would look at adding more world\'s and making the trading a real economy by having the ability to buy items and sell them for a profit in different ports. Potentially even have your ports taken over again or mutiny so you need to recapture them.',
       'Overall the game is great. Gameplay is smooth but slow (hey, old ships), making the gameplay calming. Graphics are pleasing to the eyes, though it could still need improvements. Sounds are calming too.   You guys should change the image for the gold coins since it resembles a symbol in One Piece. And also the whale movement could be smoother and slower. You could add more creatures in the ocean in addition to the whale since its just blank at times.',
       'Very simple. Gives me a lot of nostalgia. Two things though, it seriously needs music maybe some Celtic tunes or shanties. And secondly it needs more stuff to do. When I first saw a whale I was excited about doing some whaling but nope. The whales do absolutely nothing. Maybe even some treasure hunting puzzles or something. Good game just needs a little more content.',
       'One of me and my sister\'s favourite game. But we wish we could play together same team or against each other with bots. We don\'t  want to be against online players. If you guys do that I will tell alllllll my friends to play. Anyway great job keep up the work , you guys are greatüòÅ',
       'Awesome game! Two things: please do something about the controls, they feel very poor quality. Even addig a left and a right arrow would be more comfortable for me.. Second is content. This game is huuuuge. But I\'m so addicted I managed to conquer all the islands by now, so I really want more challenges. Thanks for the awesome game, keep up the good work!',
       'When you fully upgraded your ship its getting boring. Ship needs more upgrade.. like making it a ww2 warships w/ mchineguns. Port needs to recapture it. Have AI the ability to capture and guard it again. and have the ability to build outpost in island so u can defend it  when AI trying to recapture it. needs a wider map. With creatures attacking you when underway.. have the ability. Good game' ,

      'Someone needs to be fired or at least schooled on currency exchange rates. They offer 2 packs for 5 and 20 then except for rare sales which offer 49 and 79 dollar packs everything is 100 dollars google should step in and pull this game off the google play market for a square enix licensed product they have enough backing to have actual microtransactions not be a game exclusive to rich people who use 100 dollar bills as toilet paper...',
       'I kind of enjoy the game but would like it more if there were cheaper options to buying. After you buy some the prices jump to 99.99 and have yet to see cheaper prices. I\'m not unloading that in one go. The people of this game would probably make more money if they bring cheaper prices. I would buy several different little packs that eventually add up to 100 bit you ain\'t getting nothing otherwise. Also wish you could buy more things with the gold you purchased. Like have a choice to spend loyalty or gold',
       'When it\'s not crashing, it\'s fun to play.  Sucks when it doesn\'t load of locks up during game play.  Also it gets expensive as you have to buy packs at $99 a pop after the 1st 2.  The game play is addicting, but no fun if you cannot afford the special offers they continue to throw in your face every time you log in.  I love final fantasy games but this particular one is a money pit!.  Not to mention the constant crashing',
       'I started this game when it first came out. There were hardly any game advantages and everyone was having fun and on the same playing field. As more and more packages got released into the game it became a pay to win situation. I personally do not think spending $100+ on a phone game is a wise investment. Thus I enjoyed the game by taking advantage of their events and the prizes within the game. However, it has become dominated by people who payed to be the big guy and the little people get absolutely demolished. It has taken the fun out of playing, which really dissapoints me as it was a fun game to play.',
       'This game has potential to be fun but it\'s completely ruined because IT\'S COMPLETELY PAY-TO-WIN which sucked the fun out of the game that I quit. Don\'t get me wrong, Final Fantasy is highly respected RPG franchise because it\'s full of great games in the series. But no this one.  However, I might come back if the game developers make it not as pay-to-win as it is now. Right now, it\'s a complete money bucket!',
       'This game is great and fun, I love spending my time playing this game. One problem though, what is going on with the packages? Why is it every time a package is bought all the packages go from 20 to 100 dollars ? We should be able to buy the 20 dollar packages more than once! Is that fixable? Please cuz i do want to keep playing but 100 dollars is too much.' ,

      'The best racing game ever, I\'ve played this game along time ago. the first version it has 4/5 cars it was so fuuun.That was 5 years ago now I want to play it again.I feel the nostalgia ooohh the good old days.Now I\'m going to install the game.U guys change my life Thank u guys soo much guys. I hope my tears will help u guys. :)',
       'Maybe some new vehicles? Taxi. Limo. Tow truck. Hearse.... maybe some new stages too? Under water. Race track. Bridges. Derby. Graveyard.  I originally posted this way back in 2015 and yet you said you are constantly improving the game??? We try and give you the developer new ideas but it seems that no one bothers to read our comments? I guess it\'s just a lack of interest. Hopefully this time someone will read it............',
       'Its a very good game without any tension of wining any difficult task...I like it very much and its not much addicting I have played many games but its very different. controls are also good but this game needs some practice . I am enjoying this game because the tasks are not very difficult but at the same time not very easy its a perfect game and the main character of the game is very funny he always sleeps in the vehicle.....so finally.... I like this game very much',
       'Best game ever. I play it all the time even at work but people look at me stupid because im trying to keep from dying and tilting my phone like a moron.. Please make my efforts not be in vain!',
       'Plez put some changes in upgrading options..... Like..when we upgrade our vehicles...... Vehicles should look different...and..some added things like....nitros.,new wheels and etc.... By this changes this game will be liked and can be played by more and more people',
       'At first I wasn\'t sure how good the game was but after playing it several times on Android and Windows 8.1 phone, I like it.  It doesn\'t weigh down on the phone\'s processing power. A very addictive game!! Give it go.' ,

      'I really like the game, but as soon as I played multiplayer my phone crashes. I know it\'s not my phone itself but the program because my phone never crashes to anything. Please fix the multiplayer mode! It\'s really nice but constantly crashes!!! Only because of that, I\'m giveng it one star. As soon as it\'s fixed I\'ll be sure to give it 5 star and share it with my friends.',
       '1. The online mode isn\'t letting join a match 2. There should be special moves, like when you fall down, if you press the slide button, you won\'t lose speed (like in Mirrors edge) 3. The courses/levels are too easy, make it more harder',
       'The single player mode is amazing but the online mode isnt to great, i know its in beta. Either the game crashed, or the other player just can walk through walls on my screen and they win no matter what',
       'Some of the player crashing in the game pls fix so they can\'t cheat no more and when you do that I can give you 5star',
       'The multiplayer option closes the app at random. I know it\'s a new feature so I expect it will be addressed. Otherwise the game as a whole is ok. Could use more flipping it seems to me.',
       'So I turned on the game and I did some steps, maybe 30 passed and I laughed, I turned it off and I uninstalled it.  It is without a doubt hilarious.' ,

      'I played Game of War for appx 3 years.  The game started out great, everyone was on a somewhat even playing field. The game advanced to quick and left thousands of players behind. Other Players and I felt we could never keep up.  I hope this game advances at much more slower rate.  We all spend money to enjoy the game!    Don\'t be gready like GOW.  Thank you in advance.  Kirk',
       'Overall great game, however to play and be competitive ait is important to spend. In fact just to unlock some features you must spend at least .99 which is fine by me since I love to spend on this game anyways. I have been playing koa from the start and when this game came out I jumped on the bandwagon in the first 50 kingdom servers. So with that said yes it is LOTS of fun, I love my GoG family and definitely addicting LOL see you on the burning war field ;)',
       'It is a fun game and is the most indepth game I\'ve ever played. That all being said, unless you have a ton of money and a lot of time there is no way this game is worth it. I\'ve spend over $100 and play multiple times per day and I still find it hard to level up my estate. Even in an alliance unless they\'re all very high level it isn\'t much help. I\'m sure they\'re are much better games in this genre then Guns of Glory. To me it seems like a game for wealthy people and made by a company to just make money.',
       'What a great game!  Need to have introductory levels for newcomers, though.  You build your kingdom up and larger kingdom\'s just rush in and destroy you.  When you recover, they come right back.  Level into the attack mode, so people will enjoy the game more.  I am uninstalling after 6 weeks of running an Alliance, because it\'s just not worth the trouble.  Great concept, fantastic graphics!',
       'Love this game! Very entertaining, never boring. My only complaint is with some of the collecting events. You have to do certain things to obtain the necessary items to put together, but for some reason with the current one you don\'t get enough of one item, and too much of another. It would be great if you could trade within your alliance for things like this.',
       'It\'s an interesting game of strategy.  You make allies in order for your alliance to grow. At the same time always on your guard knowing at any time your allies can instantly become enemies to prevent you on your way to becoming the strongest alliance in the kingdom. There are new quests to complete weekly. Each with different rewards that help you to achieve power.There are many kingdoms on the map which is great. The only downside is you have to leave one kingdom and join another to enter it and play the game in it. Not sure if you get to keep the same level and strength you achieved. But I\'m sure that the developers will one day have it to where kingdom will be able to attack kingdom and there\'s a lot of kingdoms. The game would definitely become very intense and even more exciting then. It would also become one of the best of the best strategic games there is.' ,

      'Would of gaven 5 stars. But there some bugs that need to be worked out. Like connection and handling. But other then that this game is really close to PUGB for the phone. Massive open world. COULD do little better on the mechanic of the game but nothing to major. Would like to have a better money earn system like small amout per kill or something. This game is well dont. Ive played almsot all games on gogole play and when i say this game is fun I MEAN IT!!..',
       'Thank you for constantly improving the game. Id say at this point not to add more but to fix and adjust what you already have. Fine tuning before more additions would be great. Optimizing sounds, movements, vehicles, rendering, scoping, responses, all that good stuff would be great. Its a little laggy but thats just what you get for a giant game and 100 million+ players. Love it either way.',
       'Fun game, especially since it\'s free. But I saw that this game supports controllers so I tried to use my pro switch controller with it and so far only 2 buttons seem to work, as well as a huge delay from input to actual action. And I can\'t seem to customize the controller layout, so I\'m just stuck with the Ability to walk and crouch/lay down with said controller. Can\'t aim or shoot.',
       'The game has so much potential they just need to make it easier to see other players and easier to shoot people close to you. Also the game doesn\'t need to look realistic they should make it more like fortnite graphics and gameplay wise.  My main point is that it is too hard to see others in the game. still a good game though',
       'honestly a great game. but dont get diamonds to buy their packs. not only are they really expensive but the chance of actually getting their special clothes is so small I bought 10 packs of the monkey king and I got the same 2 grey items from all 10 packs.... like wth???',
       'Yea sure there\'s some bugs, but pros totally outweigh the cons. The game runs beautifully on a good device. Most of the problems that people are having deals with their poor devices. Lol. New gears and new map are just awesome. Best game on mobile and very ambitious for portable. Bravo! Keep those updates coming.' ,

      'Best color by number pixel art I have played. Beautiful art, reasonable controls (would be better if you could click and drag without pressing and holding first, but the only one that does that has such awful art that it doesn\'t matter), it\'s fun. Thanks for making this.',
       'I think that this is a good way for people in high school and middle school to relax and be stress free. My daughter has been using this app since 7th grade and now is a junior in high-school. She suggested that I try it because I am always stressed after work. I did. I love who ever created this game and a BIG THANKS FOR THIS GAME',
       'I love the gameplay, graphics and controls and this is just so relaxing to play! I love this compared to other sandbox games because of the controls are way better! Also when you take a pic and colour it in can you have a palette so you can colour it in different colours to the image that would be great if you could kinda edit photos by using different colours.',
       'Amazing! The only problem is that I might accidentally touch a number I already coloured and undo it. To fix this problem I suggest you make it so if you have completed a number it cannot be changed.',
       'I really  really like it!! But sometimes the LAG annoys me so MUCH!',

       'Would pay for the game to remove ads. I get you can turn off WiFi/data but it shouldn\'t be necessary, and is unfair to the company itself. Please offer a paid ad-free version!',
       'I genuinely liked the game it was fun and addictive but the ads is what kills it. Ad pop up like almost everytime you lose.. other than that its a grest game. The ads make me want to delete it. I hated giving this game a 1 star..',
       'Too many adds!! (data issue + annoying)...  or else 5 stars. I wouldnt mind even paying few bucks for this game w/ no add options.' ,

      'Is game could be so much more than it is! After a few weeks, PVP becomes a joke when you are up against paying users who have one shot kill guns and a barrage of armour.  Then single player is just rinse and repeat over and over again.',
       'Still full of annoying bugs. The worst game I ever played. Earnings are exactly layed out so that you can\'t level up as you should and in a way that you should spend a lot of money... üëé Graphic & other bugs, really not fluid etc. üëé Full of annoying ads üëé Some can shoot through walls; but you can\'t. Some can see you behind walls, but you can\'t. Starting pvp, you get placed on the map with the back to the others. Your oponents have 10x stronger weapons... Fairplay üëé Nothing is balanced fairly in pvp üëé',
       'The latest version is so annoying. On the sniper arena, my men get killed immidiatly at the end of the countdown to begin. If i even shoot any sniper he wont die rather it will finish it shoutout and then turn to my soldier and kill it. I hate now i hate d game. Please do something about it.',
       'Good graphics but the character movements are clunky.  I\'m a hardcore FPS gamer and I like to test the limitations of a game.  So tried shooting a shoulder and the bullet went for a headshot instead whereas I clearly know my aim would miss. Glitchy.  Clunky and not so realistic unfortunately.  So not sure why the high ratings.',
       'The basic concept of the game is fun, but like all games these days, micro transactions are rammed down your throat. I would be fine if that was all but then they time gate you with the weapon upgrades you need for missions and lock content out for you unless you\'ve paid for a better level of gun. Avoid this one.',
       'PvP has really gone down hill over the last few weeks. Kills just seem nonsensical. It doesn\'t look like any more levels are coming either after tier 19. Shame. It was good fun up until now' ,

      'It\'s OK I love to play the game when I\'m bored and it helps me to be settled back and have a good time. But these all happens when I\'m offline. But when I\'m connected to Wi-Fi there\'s too many ads just slapped into my face. Yes I understand that you\'ll get these ads but ketchapp seriously,will you give and ad while I\'m playing the game??!! It\'s too much for me. But still I love the game so I just play it turning my Wi-Fi off in my mobile.',
       'I know people were asking for different controls, but the new tap contols are turning the game into something so much less original.  Why don\'t you make the steering wheel work like in real cars?',
       'It\'s stupid. It\'s really boring after your first try! And, when you come to a turn, the car doesn\'t turn fast enough. When you turn before a turn, it turns too fast. This thing is hacked.',
       'I dont know why people are rating Ketchapp games below 4 stars... I agree games are difficult but one of the unique one\'s in every launch. Their creativity is awesome... Love to play each of their games. Kind of more chanlenging and unique ones',
       'This is an amazing game! But there\'s a tiny problem with the controls: they are hard to be used. In addition, there are so many advertisments and that\'s the only reason I gave 4/5 Stars',
       'Nice game but became boring in just one day! 2 options of controls: Spin (Steering Wheel) and Tap. Tap option is easier than spin. You have to complete the damn missions but the coins are only available in Normal mode they aren\'t available in arena mode. For making easy highscore follow this!! 1. Switch your controls to tap mode. 2. Open Arena mode. 3. In the beginning take the U-turn. 4. Keep driving in the middle line i.e in between of lane 1 and lane 2. 5. Just keep driving on that small line dividing both lanes and you\'ll get your highscore until and unless you get tired, I\'ve made it to 3,887.  Normal mode is quite harder than the Arena but it provides coins and you\'ve to play it for getting your missions accomplished!  Thanks' ,

      'It is ok however to delete the account you have to submit a form to the company, which is fine however the reason all reflect negatively on the customer making the company look flawless. Game play is ok but progression is slow. I suggest you make the "reasons" section free text so that you can get an accurate assessment for process improvement instead of a BS pre stagged answer.',
       'Honestly i really enjoy the game thus far thank you for all the recent updates niantic... but there is one thing that has been bothering me and that is 1v1 with friends and trading... both features were shown in the original trailer... yet again i love the care your giving the game niantic i truly praise it but i would like to know whats happening with my 2 listed thoughts',
       'The game has been majorly revamped and has benefited from it. It\'s so much better to see that content and events are happening more often. Hopefully we\'ll see the first wave of gen 4 by April or May and a nice egg event will happen to get a higher chance of a baby Pokemon from gen 4. Keep up the great work only downside is legendaries. I can\'t get them as not enough people in my area play Pokemon go and I\'m not travelling for a Pokemon. Can we have a legendary event for one week you can get 3* legendary raids? That would make it easier.',
       'I\'m an android user and also on a budget so I can\'t get the latest and greatest ever really. And every phone I\'ve ever had cannot run this stupid game. The developers really need to work with the lower quality phones to get it to be able to detect the GPS in them because it will load the character model, and the UI. Nothing else though. As soon as it starts loading it just says GPS signal not found and it can\'t ever find it  total garbage',
       'Updated content since the app was launched. Still recommended. Suggestion: After the daylight savings time change, raiding ends too early in the evenings. Setting raids to continue spawning eggs until after 8pm EST at the earliest would be great. Thanks and keep up the hard work.',
       'I love pokemon go and always get pulled back into playing it. I\'m still getting use to the updates after not playing for a while and am disapointed in the gyms. While I love being able to use them like pokestops, I wish to recall my pokeon from the gym. I love I a rural area and my poor Vaporeon has been at a gym for 13 days. THIRTEEN. I want my pokemon to come back please.' ,

      'PLEASE READ: This game is great I love it though I would rate it better if you were not so money hungry. This game is a pay to win but nearly every time you get a big update the weapons you have become really bad and you loose a lot more matches. Coins are cool to have but the weapons u need to win matches always cost gems and gems are too hard to get for free. Increasing the chance of gems would be a bit better because what fun do people have if everything good costs real money and you lose every match',
       'I love it!!! Every problem I faced is finally fixed! Can you make the Mega Destroyer a bit more powerful for the players who managed to get it before it was removed? I like the re-skins of the weapons. But can you search up a weapon that\'s in real life, add a skin to it, and then add it into Pixel Gun? Make the graphics more realistic. (Not Too Realistic)',
       'Its Great You Can Rent Guns you dont have yet and u can earn diamonds but there a problem. Every time i use the chest i never get a gun so can u increase the luck system? I love this game and its awesome my freind got it for me',
       'This game would be more fun if 1. Did not die every 2 seconds 2. Fight with people my level, not 20 levels higher 3. Everyone else survives for way longer with nothing while I die every 2 seconds with golden armour 4. To not get shot from nothing 5. actually get rewarded for playing, win a really hard round of arena? Here\'s one coin! 6. Actually getting rewarded with leveling up 7. Actually getting rewarded for playing 8. Being able to buy coins with gems, and being able to buy gems with coins 9. Being able to buy stuff with in-game currency, not real money, like I said in 8  There you go! Please take it into consideration, or at least understand Thank you Edit: and if you think that\'s done, no, you get oneshotted WITH FULL MAX LEVEL ARMOR AND MAX HEALTH. WHY, JUST WHY',
       'Absolutely wonderful, great graphics, good range of skins, nice selection of modes and maps and epic items!! it\'s awesome and a great game to enjoy. But abit of lag... I\'d rate 5 ‚õ§s if the controls were less laggy other then that its a marvelous game',
       'Well its a game were either you hate it or you love it. To many bugs ,but its all fine and dandy. Trust me I\'ve been playing on the acounts since 2014. This game has evolved so much, and I feel like I like the 2014 version better but not at the same time.     PS: Bring back old maps please.' ,

      'how awful. need to buy building upgrades. building upgrades do nothing. buildings do nothing. literally do nothing. how do you get money? spin a slot machine. Thats the only way. There is no actual game here. And what happens when you run out of spins and realize you still need millions more money to upgrade worthless buildings? give them real money. this game is so lazy it might as well be classified as a scam.',
       'I love this game. But please increase the numbers of spins every hour. And I also have come across one more problem- I get notifications saying that I have won spins and coins but when I open the app there is nothing or no way to collect my reward. I don\'t know what to do?',
       'Really so sick of this game. They really need to change some things it\'s absolutely ridiculous how some people spend a lot of their OWN money buying coins and spins for this game for someone to go right behind you and take almost every coin you have before you even got to spend them after you just spent $25 Of your actually money. So done playing this is ridiculous I should have never spent real money on this game anyways so it\'s my own fault but I mean COME ON NOW...',
       'Love the game but it restarts every time I try and watch a video for spins/coins. Also restarts when I try and invite friends to play , and trying to gift send or accept. Might have to delete and find a new game',
       'Hi coin master my only problem is that when my friends are joining I am not getting free 40 spins and they used my invitation link from Facebook but I have not received spins.and I had even email your support about it  but they didn\'t replied on it and I want my spin my three friends joined coin master but I haven\'t received spins so I want my spins which 40*3 =120 spins  Please reply',
       'Boring, repetitive, monotonous. Only downloaded it to get a freebie on another game, lost interest within 3 days. Don\'t waste your time and data with it' ,

      'The VERY best game EVER..so fast to level up... Never boring.. Always SO much to do!!! ... it NEVER asks 4 money !!!!!!   NO pop ups or commercials. !!!. . the inventors are genius... i Love this game..  thank you for making this game.. Graphics are Amazing!!!   Best farming game ...Bonus Zoo !!!...and breed ur animals ADORABLE BABIES.. with a splash of Cityville  ..Gold digging..making ingots to use...  So many optional tournaments if u want to win more money n prizes in the Regattas... Township friends make it SO much easier n fast 4 everyone  .. and so much more You just HAVE TO Try TOWNSHIP ‚ù£üíû',
       'The Best!  But not Great my suggestion is please add an option to chat your friends privately this is important!.  Also add an option to search anyone by their township name so we can easily adding them.. Last one add an option to change your profiles photo from our gallery if you can~ instead of using our Facebook photos or township original photos.. Please make it happen',
       'RSYFJH Great game very addictive, and I don\'t know if I just found the right Co-op or what but the team work on this game is amazing. I love my little town although, üòí you need to be able to expand faster! I have NO ROOM for any more buildings, and they want me to expand my population so I can add more buildings. Thats\'s kind of ridiculous. That\'s the only bad thing I have to say about this game.',
       'BEST GAME EVER! It\'s my biggest game but even though I have an old phone the game still runs really smoothly. There\'s always something to do, it never gets boring. I\'ve been playing for 8 months. Super easy to use and learn. It\'s addictive. You also don\'t feel pressured to make purchases like other games.',
       'It is obvious the developers of this game care about the players, not just their wallets. The chat function for the co-ops is sensored more than any other game I have seen! The entire game promotes fair play and positive interactions. I even encourage my kids to build their own town!',
       'I love this game. Amazing sound effects, graphics. You guys did a great job that\'s for sure! But still couldn\'t give it a five star because of the lastest update. The entire screen goes black after playing the game for 5-6 minutes. That\'s pretty irritating not to mention how much slower the phone gets as well. Didn\'t have these issues with the last update. Fix it please!' ,

      'Cool game. I think I can say it\'s one of the best Android LEGO games I\'ve played. The visuals are cute and cool and the gameplay is impressively efficient. But this game suffers with the same problem of other LEGO games: why there\'s no cloud saving? Why can\'t you use Google Play or Facebook to keep our progress? I just can\'t understand.',
       'Love this game but it would be really awesome if the theme background would change instead of always driving in the street. Perhaps have a park theme and other areas maybe a beach theme and they ride on jetskis and collect coins jumping over obstacles etc. Make it more diverse and less of the same thing. And nore fun characters üòÄ',
       '*This game is amazing try it out it\'s sooo addictive you can play it all day , the only thing I don\'t like is that you can only buy characters and the prices increase on how many you buy.*',

      'Ok.....we need an aquarium just for the holiday\'s.  I cleaned out one aquarium and that\'s all I have in there is the holidays.  After this session I\'ll probably save one just for Christmas itself.  Love the unlimited times! Keep the surprises coming!! I don\'t like so many clocks in one game and the "timed" games are insane! It is definitely challenging.  I play several times a day if possible.',
       'Great game but would love it more if it kept track of when you bought something . Like a little quantity number in the corner after you purchase a fish or decorations. Hard to save up to buy things for guests, sucks when you buy something you already have when trying to complete a task. Other then that it\'s a great game lol I enjoy playing it.',
       'Great game. Challenging, fun, and addictive lol. I\'m 32 and play this often so it\'s not just for kids . Give it a try it\'s very satisfying . Just wished you could add friends ... People that play whom you may not know so we all could help each other. That would make it more interactive and a lot more fun. No one I know plays so it would have to be other fellow fishermen üòâ',
       'Fantastic game! It\'s great fun decorating the aqariums and the game board is very clear. The recent move of the boosters to the right hand side of the screen was a VERY bad decision, as I have accidentally used them when my hand has brushed against them - this has happened many times already. A good addition would be a marker indicating a purchased item.',
       'Because you only get 5 lives and you make some levels with too few moves. It would be nice if you could interact more with your fish and tanks. The whole point of beating levels is to build up your tanks...but you can\'t do anything with them while waiting for lives. It would be a fantastic game if there was more to do within the tanks!',
       'I Loooove Fishdom!!!üòÅ I\'m absolutely addicted to this wonderfully fun & challenging game. The graphics are very cute & entertaining. The only issue i have is that I\'m up in levels 180+ & there\'s just NO way to make the amount of coins to purchase ALL the decos/plants i earn. Most are priced too high.' ,

      'This game can fit almost ANY personality type, keeping you entertained for hours!  Don\'t worry about getting low scores, because the game starts out slow and gets faster, so you\'ll always be prepared for faster tiles.  There are challenges where you challenge other people in the world!  I never want to give up on this game, its really addicting!',
       'I enjoy this game a lot and always loved how it challenged me. It was also fun when me and my friends would fight to see who\'s better but I dislike the update where they added boosters, it doesn\'t seem fair and for me it feel like it loses the title for being relaxing. I don\'t think that adding those futures was a great idea in my opinion and I really miss the old version a lot.',
       'This game has no WORLD\'S favourite song  DESPACITO  SO i m hating it tooooo much  when i see this then i think that let\'s download it bcoz it contains despacito song also but when i see all album of this app then i started hated it. So i would request from CHEETAH GAMES that plezz add DESPACITO SONG also in it This is my humble request from CHEETAH GAMES.',
       'This game is honestly a great time-killer and even has it\'s challenging parts, but from what I\'ve noticed as you get to the higher tier songs they just get slower and slower and are just flat with barely any challenge. I expected more of a challenge with a higher level but now this game is getting horribly boring.',
       'Great game. Played to level 120 and have over 500 gems but then I switched devices. This requires a Facebook account which I did not have. It worked for a little bit until Facebook disabled my account for doing nothing. They need to fix the method they use to sync progress. Now I am level 3 with 17 gems.',
       'I\'m in love with this game. It\'s challenging, you don\'t have to listen to the music to follow the tiles, and it gives you the feeling to be better. I have a suggestion for a new song you can buy for diamonds. Can you add any song from the My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic TV show? Thanks.' ,

       'Is this a game or an ad',
       'The whole concept of the game is very interesting. But the game has way too many glitches due to ads and maybe the new update. This game can literally give someone cardiac arrest because you could be about to get a goal and then the game just freezes. Lol.',
       'This game beats the whole purpose of dumb ways to die. It\'s meant to be a game with mini games after mini games. Not ads and points and avatars and money and everything complicated! Deleting and getting the original.',
       'OK, so personally, FANTASTIC! I only have a few things I don\'t like about the app. 1. WAY to many adds. 2.Bad Controls. And 3.Kind Of Slow. Other than Those concerns, this is an great app and I suggest it to anyone who likes these kind of games. Also, this is a great time killer to. Please make those little changes and you app will be perfection. Thanks!',
       'The adverts ruin this game, so many pop ups. Also the availability to watch adverts for digital item.. need to watch 30 of the 20sec ads.. who even had this spare time to do this? The game itself is great though but I\'m uninstalling because of what I mentioned above.' ,

      'Okay heres the thing,every f game is with money and this game was so much better without those money,i was 1000 lvl and my tom is gone why? Cuz u didnt made that feature back in the days,also u made this stupid diamonds alll for money,and not coins like it was...its not all about money get it? This game was so popularbback in the days and now is trash with all those videos to watch all those money you need to spend on clothes for tom...its ridiculus...sry for my english im just disapointed cuz u turned this game in real money not coins where you can be able to buy everything by playing like i did....',
       'The newest update is terrible with "to open chests". I must stop every game right after I got a key of four. Then, I can\'t play with my favorite, because Tom is sleeping. Also, it is very bad, the new chests opportunities starts not at midnight like before, but late afternoon (my friend\'s starts 11am) - ridiculous. I reached 99 - can I get back the old version? I don\'t care any firefighter cloth.',
       'Not good for little ones. Too many buttons leading ads or in app purchases. Might be good for kids 6+ who would know a little better but my 3 year old just clicks everything shiny which of course is ads or in app purchases',
       'I think this game is very very fun and addictive! Dont believe people who say talking animal games have people in their eyes, (except maybe Angela) Keep up the good work!',
       'It\'s a good game and nice way to let time pass ... I like it very much tom looks too cute when he\'s young at the age around 5 ... after all I like the game but one thing that I didn\'t like was that after the gems are finished there is no way of getting them back without spending real money so I think there should source in the game which would provide gems however the game is good',
       'Don\'t get me wrong good game, but most of the adds freeze up the game. Plus it has caused pop ups on my phone. Fix that and i will fix my rating' ,

      'Sometimes it makes no sense. You are coming from quailication as 7th, you jump to 2nd position so surely you cant finish worse than 8th? WRONG. You end up on 16th place which is impossible. There is no in between you either win or you finish 14th or lower. You have 30 pts lead in front of number 2. after 1st round, you slightly fail your 2nd jump, guess what? 18th place for you! If you jump for example 120m on a K90 in Q, you finish first because everyone jumped 20m less, sudennly in 1st round you need 130m to secure your first place because everone managed to jump extra 30m.

      'Great game. The games are more fun than Candy crush and much more fair. For example, they let you make moves you can\'t play in Candy crush and timed rounds don\'t start until you touch the screen. Also, while some of the games are really challenging, you don\'t get stuck on them for days and days.  There are no gems or gold bars, etc. You don\'t have to slowly earn some kind of premium currency or pay real money to get special prizes.',
       'Loving it.  Reached level 370, and am really enjoying the game. Fun, good graphics, good story. Nice balance of challenging levels and easier ones, but so far no levels that look impossible. On the negative side, 900 hard won coins for 5 extra moves is ridiculous. When replaying a level it would be nice if you could go straight to the game play without the screen telling you what you need, we already know.',
       'I think that we should get more  coins for winning the levels. I find that the game can cost me money that I don\'t have, so I will spend less time playing your game. I love this game alot but why play if you are not getting enjoyment because it costs to much to play. (Otherwise I love the game) I also never got my horse, please give me my horse, I really need that horse btw. I already had a name for her to. I was going to call her daisy. The name goes great with the garden theme. (If you hadnt realized thst already) Please please send me daisy, I love her already. Peace.',
       'It was a lot of fun the first few "days" but got very hard very fast. Don\'t bother with power-ups as it doesn\'t really make a difference. The only way to win is to get lucky with a big bomb. That\'s it. It\'s a shame because the game is nice, I just progress way too slowly now for it to be worth playing.',
       'I enjoy playing this game but I think 900 coins is crazy for 5 extra lives. There are other games I play that offer less coins and a boost for a smaller price. On one game I play it\'s 65 coins for 10 extra moves and a boost, on a different one it\'s 25 coins for 5 extra moves. I also think that stars for each level should vary too. For harder levels it should be 3 stars, for medium levels it should be 2 stars, and for easy levels 1 star. I\'ll continue to play no matter what, it\'s fun, challenging and strategical!',
       'The first thing that comes to mind is that you guys have gone above and beyond on this one!! It\'s so much fun!! From the interactions of restoring the grounds, to decorating them (custom, might I add !!)    To the actual sounds the game makes while playing.. I can\'t stay off of it. And yes I\'m constantly tempted to purchase coins when I can\'t beat a level, for like the 7th time!!  Haha üòÇ Great game guys!! We would ALL appreciate more gifts than currently available. Especially for your daily addicts, üòÅ Forever a gamer.     Xx' ,

      'The game itself is very well thought of, highly addictive and is a great time killer. Plus, there are almost no ads in this game. However, there are just too many animations. It\'s almost impossible to play this hame st a consistent frame rate. Maybe add an ability to downscale the resolution or tone down the animations?  Edit: after the new update they fixed it. The game runs buttery smooth',

       'This game is very addictive but it just seems like an ad watching game. All the company cares about is money so they spam ads on to the game. Why play mini games for Golden Apples when you could just watch ads for Golden Apples since they let you watch infinite ads. Why play Classic, Zen or Arcade for Starfruit when you could just watch ads.',

      'Ive been playing for the better part of a year, and this game started out great for a long while. But IGG not only panders and gives better deals to Chinese people, cheaper packs etc. But literally 99% of all mega guilds and players are Chinese or Vietnamese. If your not asain don\'t play this game  you\'ll end up like me playing forever just to quit because of the obvious discrimination IGG holds with its playerbase',
       'Do NOT go for high level military research without searching monster hunting, and Do NOT go for T4 if you not going to spent thousands of dollars. Even if you don\'t mind to wait 200 days, you will not able to afford it (lvl 10 military Def, Atk, Health cost 100m gold each). DO NOT GO FOR HIGH MILITARY AND T4 WITHOUT FULLY UNDERSTANDING THE GAME.',
       'This game is fun but be prepared for the mother of all Pay2win games.  These folks at IGG are experts at crafting new and exciting ways at fleecing their customers of every cent they can.  You CANNOT compete if u dont pay and pay often.  Players here ...just regular people... dump hundreds of rl $$$ regularly.  You have been warned.',
       'If you like spending mad money to be an Internet tough guy this is the game for you.  Of you have tons of time to kill to be a punching bag for pay to play Internet tough guys it may also be the game for you.  If the computer random stuff kills off your troops don\'t expect to get tech support, it will always be reviewed in 1-3 days, even the next time you ask, another 1-3 days.',
       'Game Sucks! Super high levels can come in wipe you out, seems like if they had a level limit, let\'s say 5 levels above you they can\'t attack, but O NO!!  Every day I come in to find I have been attack by a level 25 and I\'m only a level 14. It takes days to rebuild, so yeah everyday same thing, about to uninstall this game not worth it to me...',
       'Coloseum is BS. I think one reason is because you cant control who you can attack. I mean come on, auto battle sux really. You can be defeated by a low level and low rank with same type of heroes seriously? I would rate this zero if i could but bad luck for me i couldnt. Its getting worst everday. Ever since i rated this game, i never won a single battle in colo. Really? I wish i can rate this zero. This game is BS. No improvement ever since. I think i have edited this 3 or 4x already and nothing has changed. I gave up colo is BS.' ,

      'Awesome game I had ever played in my life... although I\'m 20 just..üòâüòâ I just loved the game.today 21/02/2018 I installed it on my phone.within 1 hr I played 100+ times. Till now my highest score is 74 & I\'m in challenge 25. Really loved this game very much. I recommend this game to my each & every friend...(even my enemy also...üòÇüòÇ Just kidding) I wished that I will cross 1000+ score on future.  Loved this game. Lots of Love to this game & ketchapp. üòòüòòüòò‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è',
       'Another great game from ketchapp. A very unique idea, executed well and with nice graphics. It is simple yet difficult, a good combination. I gave it 4 stars however, as sometimes the game takes a while to respond to my touch, and often doesn\'t respond at all. My phone is quite slow though, so I\'m willing to give the game the benefit of the doubt.',
       'Fun little time killer. My only problem is that daily rewards fail to show up most days. It could be a problem on my end, but I don\'t know, and it\'s a pretty small issue so I don\'t really care.',
       'I\'ve noticed that when I get higher in the challenges the ones involving lane switching glitch out and never let me complete it. I have counted and I don\'t think it is possible for me to have counted incorrectly 20+ times repeatedly. Also now whenever I boot up the game it has the beginner tutorial pop-up telling you what to do which is annoying.',
       'This is the most addictive game i have ever played. I always play it when am bored and you can play it when your offline. Totally recommend it but pls answer this question..what is the world highest score?',
       'Absolutely great game.. I love it!  For those who say that there is so many ads, its not true, I don\'t have that problem..But if you want to be sure,that ads won\'t appeare just turn off your cellular data.. :)' ,

      'I don\'t think I need to \'review\' much here. There are some points I definitely don\'t like about the game. Such as the matchmaking... You get matched with the same deck type in a row. Other than that and some minor flaws it\'s a great game. I love the competitive aspect about it.  Finally I would suggest some 2v2 with different game modes, such as ramp up 2v2. Also, add the rematch button in 2v2 challenges with random mates.  Hope I hit the 4,3k this season. Good luck to all clashers!',
       'I think Clash Royale is a great game to play and is very well put together for all ages, it is a fast paced game and at the same time can be played with an individual pace of your own to a degree being that there is a clock ticking, also new characters are released at a well balanced rate, so that the game doesn\'t become boring and the regular balance of the characters strengths and weaknesses are balanced to make the game more competitive. I recommend this game for all ages and abilities. It\'s great for a few minutes or an hour or so and this game also has several different tournaments you can enjoy yourself or with a friend or a teammate. See you soon on Clash Royale. A.K.A. Dad.',
       'Supercell, I think your best game is hay day. Clash royale on the other hand isn\'t one of your better games. Android is better than apple. Why would you ever support apple instead of android. You released Brawl Stars only for apple. You should have less medieval/fantasy games unless you make the knights, princes etc. More realistic. In my opinion I think you\'re better at making farm and army games. Please make more of thoseüòñ',
       'This is the only game of its kind. Many companies try to copy, but this is the original and the best. There are  endless possibilities of card combos and decks that you could use making the game always entertaining. My only complaint is that the trainer is way too easy to beat. It is one of few games that you could get competitive without using your own üí∞. I also like how the stuff that u unlock in the beginning does not go to waste later in the game.',
       'What do we do?  I have been playing this game from 9 months now. In these 9 months i got 3 Legendary Cards 2 from chest and 1 from Clan Chest. But the thing is that all of them were Ice Wizard. I\'m in Arena 9 from 2 months now Because i dont have the cards to win. I check the tv royale every time i open the Game for a good deck But. So Supercell tell me what do i do? I can\'t push to Hog Mountain then what do i do in this game? Please do something',
       'Really a awsome  addictive  game.. but its not a fair play..  It  offered me only one  legendary card as I am playing from the beginning.  In the other hand one of my friend started playing just 4 months ago but he owned 5 legendary cards. one from the crown chest, another from the legendary chest and recently he got another one in the super magical chest. Now you decide. Is it a fair play?.  Really Disappointed üëé. And on the other hand it is pay to win game.. In some cases skill doesn\'t work .' ,

      'Love the game. I hate that there is a ad after every end. If you have to restart, you\'ll get any ad before you can continue. Outta frustrating Ann\'s makes me not want to play.',
       'The ads are so Terrible they interrupt gameplay now so if you were placing a block forget it it just placed itself because it registers that you let it go. Good game but not worth the annoyance.',
       'Really you have no idea what\'s coming next, so you can\'t plan on your next strategic move. Its all luck if you make it to the next round or not. So theres no challenge. I do appreciate the fact it has no ads.',
       'It would be better if the adverts didn\'t stop you playing the game. Also asking for the rating every five mins pisses me off',
       'Foolishly made game, many a times the three blocks they send don\'t even fit in the remaining blocks. I mean, u shud send the blocks such that people shud love thinking where they all will fit, if allowed in comments I would have sent screen shot of game where I lost in it, to ask u guys where the hell these three blocks fit. I wud suggest to take it as an error in ur game n resolve it.',
       'Addictive! Enjoy playing. Of course there are ads! The developers have to fund themselves! Not 5* because the graphics are a little"out"... The block is displaced from my touch location' ,

      'Wow how do u make it soooo incredibly cute? Even the icons r cute, the outfits r cute as well , cutest bunny pet game ive ever seen. Plz add more games...so far i dont hav a prob witt it n i cant wait for my lil cutey to grow up. I love it to the max thanks',
       'Love it! Just wanna ask.. Did you copy "My Talking Angela" game? The bath tub , dress up place and bed is similar to Angela okay.. Oh and Angela collect stickers and the bunny did too.. So I might says its a copycat rather if it\'s good.. I don\'t like copycat sorry. Even there is a white ball in her eye maybe some people is looking at us who playing? Don\'t install',
       'IT\'S SO CUTE! I LOVE IT! I JUST HAVE 3 SUGGESTIONS.  1. CAN YOU ADD A BOOKSHELF INTO THE BED ROOM SO WE CAN READ TO OUR BUNNY? 2. WHEN RUBBING THE BUNNY IT PURRS LIKE A CAT? PLEASE CHANGE IT( I\'M GUESSING YOU GOT THE PURRING IDEA FROM MY TALKING ANGELA).3.I CAN\'T BRUSH HER TEETH ONLY USE THAT SUCTION THING PLEASE FIX THIS!  BUT OVERALL A VERY CUTE AND FUN GAME TO KILL TIME!',
       'Well, it\'s really a pretty game, and quite similar to Angela and Tom the cats, but it has unique mini games and a map and this is a plus, but a disadvantage is in the work of game. There is always bags! A lot of them. For example I choose white hair colour, but next time I\'m into the game it\'s changed into blue! It happened every time. Mini games are running not as smooth as in the beginning, so you can\'t continue to play. Sometimes, when you get new items of clothes and try them on, there is now bunny to see them on her, and then there is only the white screen and game closed. Please, fix it, and I\'ll instal this app with pleasure one more time.',
       'It\'s so cute. I cant even describe how great it feels when youve been gone for a long time, then you come back to the app and see you have like 30 likes or so. It just makes you feel acomplished. I also enjoy how its not a pay to win game.',
       'Love my bunny,but would like to be able to save my progress from one  device to another maybe via email form as I\'ve worked hard on her,game sometimes bit glitchy please also add more games so this game does need an update' ,

      'Fun addictive game, alot of ads but you can X out of them quickly. What the downfall is..if you hit a "perfect" shot, it still drifts left or right. Plus offline bonus are odd. First 3 or 4 days the log on bonus was over 15-20k after not playing about 12-14 hours. Now its a little over 5k bonus. Bummer',
       'This game is a very simple way to pass some time. Almost no skill required. There are ALOT of ads. Paying for the premium version removed the ads between shots, but still offers occasional ads to upgrade your guy. Also watching an add to double your offline bonus always results in no ads available to watch lol. Speaking of which for the first few days offline bonuses are huge, but they become MUCH smaller after a few days.',
       'Good game, quite addictive. However, two things: 1) It\'s draining my battery quite a bit when running 2) There\'s no way to quit the game. I can only exit by hitting "home" on my phone. It seems as though the battery drain is preventing my phone from running properly, so now I need to force close the app to ensure I can continue to use my phone properly.  I would like to see this game improve in terms of battery usage,',
       'Great addictive game. Only annoying thing is when you start hitting further, the perfect shots still drift a long way left or right. Impossible to get it up the centre of the road. Also a lot of ads which is fine, would definitely pay for ad free if it was a bit cheaper.',
       'So many adds. Pretty easy game. But so many adds.  You spend way too much time watching add than actual playing.  It\'s ridiculous.  Uninstall till that\'s fixed. I know the ads are to make money but damn if you\'re that hard up stop making apps for phones and go to work',
       'The game is fine, can be a fun little time waster. But there are so many adds its almost unplayable. Pretty much every turn you\'re given another full video or interactive add, meaning you spend double the amount of time watching adds versus playing the game.' ,

Please fix this in my account. Otherwise, I love the game. Remember to buy something to fix the ads.  Edit: I sent customer support an email with a screen shot a month ago. There has been no response.',
       'I like merging games, but this one has a huge ad issue that makes the game somewhat frustraiting to play. I\'ll click the store to buy a house and it will auto start an ad video. It\'s lacking a bit in the story line department too. For a base merging game it\'s simple and fun, but definitely needs some work.',
       'Such a terrible money grab. Ads cinsta tly pop up, making a consistent method for progressing impossible (which was most likely the goal). Didn\'t have patience to get very far, I feel like I\'ve wasted my time in the 5 minutes I played. Greedy devs forcing quality content behind a paywall making the game virtually unplayable for free. Terrible job.',
       'Ever wanted to be Mayor? Ever wanted to run a town, develop the land, and see a metropolis grow? Well, look no further than Animal Crossing cuz this game does none of those things. You just merge buildings into better buildings. It is fun, if you spend money so that you\'re not bombarded with ads. But then you run the risk of being unable to watch ads when you want to to do things like double your earnings or unlock a better building from the mystery box.',
       'When opening the game it loads fine Nd does its idle thing, but I can\'t tap on anything. Completely 100%unrespomsive. After multiple attempts. Will change rating if game becomes playable before I forget about this review.',
       'Too many useless ads! I don\'t like being forced to watch ads. Especially when they take up more of your time than gameplay. The game forced me to watch a 15 second ad just to open the store. UNINSTALL!!!' ,

      'Got to the moon in 2 tries,  mars took longer, though it was mars one way, Venus was a challenge. Now I want more, haha, fun game. Encourages innovation. Idea: with persistent modules already in the game, why not allow orbital modules like a space station? Or missions where you need to put a satellite into orbit. How about reusable rocket stages? Updates just make the game better.',
       'So I\'ve been playing the game for a couple of months now. i think that there is an awesome game here, with already plenty to do. I do also think that there is lots of room and need to improve upon this. As I have been playing for a while, I do notice it becomes quite challenging to escape orbit with enough fuel to make it to other planets, like mars. i do recommend you add a cheats section that you can enable in the settings, with unlimited fuel, larger build space, indestructable rockets, etc. I also recommend more bits and pieces for building, like bigger and more powerful thrusters, or air vents for turning in space. For later development, a satellite system would be much appreciated, as well as a little spaceman that you can control when docked at a space station, or when you\'re on a planet. Thank you for an awesome game!!!',
       'I landed on the Moon and... I got back to Earth safely on manual control! What\'s with you, you think I\'m expendable?! There is no way to add new destination once the original one is attained. Also it would be great to have a payload that can be carried other then the capsule alone. Other than this is the greatest fun I had in a while.',
       'I am so addicted to this game. I love everything about it. I just wish there was a place to donate to you (developer). Also, I would love it if there were more rocket parts. Also, I wish there was a thermosphere you had to get through to get on planets. All in all, I love it! Can\'t get enough!  Edit: Thank you so much for the reply. I\'m sorry I wasn\'t clear on the thermosphere part, but i think the reentry effect would be lovely. I just can\'t stop playing. And I\'m SOOOO excited about rovers and things! Thank you so much again! :)',
       'I got to the Moon my second launch! Fun game for doing a launch while waiting for the bus etc. It\'s simple and I like it! Couldn\'t figure out how to decouple my boosters simultaneously. Very nice work on this app! It\'s KSP but mobile version very cool! The music is cool too! My suggestion is to add some reentry heat affects, more sounds like parachute opening sound, etc but I\'m sure that\'s on your list.',
       'Bee looking for a game like for my entire years ! this is the best rocket game, I have ever seen in my life travelling to space , I like the sound system , formation of building materials is compatible ,graphics are excellent to the 2D platform . I like the physics of the game. Please keep it , ur the best Space programmer of all times (GOAT). Is it possible to add a space shuttle and moon rover ?    Regards. Please fix up batrrey issues . my phone heats up a lot .' ,

      'This is by far the best chess "trainer" for me.  It\'s got a nice flow and the game isn\'t "stupid" like most other chess apps/games I\'ve played.  I plat at least a few games every night and I feel like it give me a nice challenge and makes me really think about the moves I\'m making.  Especially at the higher difficulty levels.  Overall a great chess app with no glitches and a good brain inside of it.  A must for a chess player with any real skill at the game.',
       'I love this game and the best brain exerciser game ever in the history.  The cool 3d view makes the game as if I am playing on the real board, very good graphics. However, it doesn\'t show the list of killed chessman during game play the only drawback. I am expecting this upgradation and this will be the perfect Android chess.',
       'For the non experts, let me tell you that 5his game cheats. I sat with a real chessboard to analyse why wasn\'t I  able to crack master level.   And what i observed was it didn\'t allow you to make actual moves when you show high levels of intell8gence. Sometimes it makes moves which are faulty. I think there is some mistakes in coding, perhaps deliberately made.  So not a fair play but a foul play.',
       'it\'s just a chess game yea, but it actually looks nice for a change. most chess games are really boring because all they have are symbols and very rarely, possibly sound. when you think it\'s boring that means you don\'t like chess, but not the app. what do you expect? guns and explosions? didn\'t think so.',
       'So far it\'s o.k. I like the fact that it is simply a chess game with no fancy sound effects or graphics. I see no real reason to have the higher difficulty levels locked out until they are beaten but they are. I got it to practice with. It is useful for that. It\'s not bad...Just a simple down to earth chess game',
       'The game has been drawn because the other player has no legal move and is not in check. If they can ot move then I win because they cannot move to a legal position.

      'Many games say they are free to play but you are limited as how far you can go without putting money into the game as long as you grind and have patience as takes time. . GoH is not like that. You can actually gain the better gear, the better characters, etc without dropping buckets of money in the game. All you need to do is regularly play the game, level up your character,and participate. Doing so you will get stronger characters. This game has great gameplay, awesome characters,fun PvP and it\'s just addicting overall. This game is truly free to play.',
       'Great game. Nice mix of action and turn based play. The fact that you can search for specific shards, gear, crafting parts is a touch of genius - no grind. Separate energy for two areas means longer play. Only downside is the rating for this is not high enough! Also, background music changes according to location, very nice detail. Massive amount of characters and variations of them. Great game guys. Really looking forward to updates.',
       'All the main movie characters and space ships to use. Wish u would make more farmable but over one of the best games out there. I actually prefer it compared to Xbox due to no issues with extensive network down periods. If u want us to pay then we gotta be able to play when we want right? Someone else should send that to Xbox they stopped caring long ago. Well done again for the game',
       'Amazing game. Really hits me in the childhood. Great mechanics, events, character moves/abilities, great art style, and unlike most mobile games, does not require paying a dime. It may take a while to reach a high level, but with practice and dedication, you can really go far in this game. I even recommended it to a lot of my family members. Would rate higher than 5 stars if that were an option. No problems whatsoever with the game.',
       'This update gave the players most of the things they have been asking for over a year now. The only issue i have is that EA is still pushing its pricing model with this game. 300 dollars to full star up a character + another 200 for gear. Its a bit much. The F2P is still full and while you will be hardpressed to make it to number 1 on your shard it is possible and gives great satisfaction. I would recommend atleast giving it a try.',
       'Best game in this style yet.  There are many similar games, some has better graphyc and etc, but this one is the most balanced. Many nice updates. Game changes everytime.  Not very easy also not very hard.  And the most important thing is that u dont need whole day. Just 15 minute  to do every daily mission. Best game yet. I wish if you give me beta test acc  for youtube channel.' ,

      'First of all It\'s joyful game few notes need to address it:    1_last 3 weeks is suddenly stopped without farther notification.. And I was about to uninstall it..     2_one of the question was you can play with other users offline. This is not correct!...     3_ need to add "Edit and changing names"     4_Game rated with 5 star.. Than you all üé±',
       'I realize y\'all gotta get paid but why make the playing experience for those of us that don\'t pay cash money.  Not allowing a player to select a pocket when shooting the 8 ball and allowing your opponent to shoot and win. I guess I\'m pretty good because nobody has been able to get rid of me playing pool. Instead I seem to get strange lock ups or no response from game. I always seem to lose 100s of thousands. It\'s a pretty good app and I\'ve sent many people to download your app.',
       'Best pool graphic wise but the game is not fair what so ever. Game is Controlled you don\'t decide if you win the game does. Your win percentage and rank don\'t mean squat. Cues length and force controlled to games advantage even when reloaded. I had 6,991,000 and my win percentage was 61.3 and lost 1 million 5x in a row. How do I have a 61.3% chance of winning and lose so easily by these 40-50% players like nothing. If you don\'t actually buy stuff with actual money on app game will treat you poorly.',
       '8 ball i have been playing it for sometime now and I spend alot of money on the specials.. great specials.. but I noticed whenever I buy coins I don\'t win any games until those coins are over and I\'m only winning recently 2 games maximum in a row and normally my win streak used to be 7 and above... I don\'t know why this is happening but it sucks because it\'s putting me off the game.. it\'s like 8 ball is making sure I\'m losing hence the rate 3',
       'This is the most addictive game i have playing since a bought this phone. All the new updates are cool. Need to get rid of those hackers playin along. Also when we get a phonecall the game reopens, its better if you  reconnect it during the tier its self .. very plesent game give lots of happiness.. make sure you work with above mentioned glitches, then 5* is sure.',
       'I love this game an it is def super fun. Only complaint I have has nothing to do with the actual game play tho. When ever I try to get free coins from doing offers like surveys even tho I do everything it ask in order to get the coins it ends up never giving me the coins even after I do everything it says... plz fix this problem. Or reward me with the coins I never got from completing certain offers.other than that I love the game.' ,

      'I think this app is great! But there is a slight problem with selling items. When I repeatedly sell items, sometimes if, for example, I was selling an item for 6831 coins, then it would subtract 6831 from the total amount of coins I have and then add back in 6831 so I\'d end up with just the same amount of coins I was at! Could you please fix this small bug? It would make this app even better!',
       'Developers, please read.  First, this is a fun game and I enjoy its play style. It\'s reminiscent of TV shows like Battles Bots and game series\' like Bot Arena.   Second, I would like to suggest giving players the ability to add, delete, and move weapon, utility, and wheel anchors. In the same way players can currently add enhancements to parts and chassis\'s and move around stickers.   Third, It would be appreciated if Quick Play Super Boxes replaced Regular Boxes after all shipment slots are full. It would provide a greater incentive to keep playing Quick Play beyond just Winning Streak Crown Rewards.  I\'m offering these suggestions because I really enjoy this game and would like to see it become a more fulfilling and personalized experience.  Thank you,',
       'I absolutely love this game. I spend a lot of time on it! It\'s fairly balanced between players who play for free and those who purchase gems to give their bots better stats. You can easily rank up without paying a dime. I did for so long, until I kept hoarding pieces and didn\'t want to sell. I began to use gems instead of coins.',
       'Game it self is great and a ton of fun.   But, the system for showing ads is so annoying.  It\'s not just your normal video ad no, they make you watch 3 different ads and a min of 16 or 11 sec each.  After you have watched the minimum time, you have to hit next and repeat again',
       'I want to report a glitch. I betted 3 parts, titan, drill, and a repulse. I lost on thd bet, and guess what? The titan car still had that tick on on it, then i got those stickers on the car unlimited. It took me 5 minutes to get back to normal. Please dont use this peopole.',
       'Bonjour people!   This game is great! Internet connection required tho....wish there was a bot mode. Otherwise 5 stars!!! 6 if I could!

      'Lots of fun, creative and very easy!  Review update: I reinstalled in 2018 to find it has changed. You cant dig down very far like you could before, or down to water (it only floods a little bit in places) so I couldn\'t make a moat for the castle.',
       'Well,This Game Is Kinda Good.Im Gonna Rate It For 5 Stars In The First Place But It Changed My Mind After That. The Graphics Is Good,The Controls Are Good Too And Everything is really good. BUT THE ONLY PROBLEM it is very LAGGY. Maybe Next Time When You Make An Another Update,Make some improvemnts of not being laggy. PLS.',
       'This game is a dream come true!!!!! Firstly the controls are phenomenal, graphics are astonishing and techniquely... everything in this game is the best. Minecraft is already becoming stupid because of the high payments as they are the most creative crafting game. Well guess what? This is even more creative. Minecraft is just dumb. Art is good everything is good about minecraft but what gives for the price. While this app is the best and freee!!!',
       'Better than minecraft at crafting. No hp so no problem fall from high ground. If ure creative, this is a must have apps. Its abit slow to build, still better than minecraft mobile. Ive built a big croc and built inside its body houses.',
       'I have a significant concern with how easy it is to accidentally spend the gems. It has happened at least once, though I\'m assuming it happened a second time while I was quickly clicking building a building, since fifteen gems are now unaccounted for. I cannot feel comfortable with this game if at any given moment, all my gems might get spent because of one misclick.',
       'I really like this game it is very fun. The only thing is, how do you wave, I dont know but I play it on PC so I am not very sure how to wave so please tell me if you can do it on PC. Also can you maybe update is so you can use it on PC with w a s d because I am used to it. Anyway love the game good job!' ,

      'Game is good. But why is there no exit button in the game?? There are lots & lots of ads. Even if you pause a game there is an ad. Really annoying. Also my phone gets heated so much. It seems it is using lot of my phone\'s battery & Internet.',
       'Too many ads. Impossible to quit. Ads has movies and sounds all the time and it does not respect the sounds option. Very anoying. The game does not inform the price to buy it. Need improvements. The game is interesting, but not fantastic.',
       'A fun and really addictive game. Bought the ad removal immediately and I don\'t regret it. One of my current favorites.  I hope the developer keeps to this game, supporting and adding to it. Perhaps more modes... Eg. A timed mode for the rows to be added?',

      'I\'m 11 and i love it so much.I have some Ideas for a toca kitchen 3. You can be able to make sandwiches and soups or stews. And more ingredients, more people. And you could add mustard and mayonnaise. Wait Maybe you could make tacos and weird ones. These are just  suggestions but I would love to see some of these suggestions. You would call it Toca Kitchen 3, with a nice logo. I did like toca kitchen 1 & 2. It is fun to play and food, and when we mess up to see how the people eating the food react. Bye.',
       'Awesome! You Can choose your pick. I am only using 9 and I love this. It is really interesting what they like and what they dislike. Thanks for making this , Toca Boca! I\'m sure 7 year olds would be giggling with laughter. Keep up the good work! Best regards, -Bella on MSP',
       'I\'m giving a 5 star rating, not cuz I like this game but because I want you to make all your games free or at least the toca life:city or vacation. Please I always wanted that game because It looks really fun and it must be. You probably won\'t make them free but if you can, make toca life city free at least',
       'I like how I can give the guests disgusting drinks and food a see and hear their really funny reaction! Once I gave the girl a drink that had water,and all the spices and all of that, and she was like, the funniest reaction!üòÜüòÜ I also like how  there are different cooking supplies and spices and utensils! Keep up the good work! And make sure to make more today games free! Because then everyone will love you!',
       'I LOVE this app! And I\'m so glad it\'s free! Everyone is like \'it\'s the same thing over and over again\' but they\'re not actually getting into this game. They\'re are tons of different options to choose from and like Toca Boca says cook it your way. I LOVE TOCA BOCA!!!',
       'This is the best game ever it is also funny because I was giving the girl food and I gave her some strawberries and I put a lot of lemon, hot sauce, Barbiecu sauce,Manas,keckup,salt, and pepper... SO funny, it also sounds just like a kid is playing with the food, that I\'m eating grapes right now,üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÅüòÄüòä‚ò∫üôÇüòê' ,

I wanted to go back in time and tell myself "boi. That\'s CONK! Not bepsi!" And then succ all of the conk bottles up so nobody has to deal with it.',
       'It\'s awesome very addictive, my game likes to freeze or glitch sometimes and I crash or die but it\'s a free game so not overly concerned about it. Overall great game when they game out with the sequel it addressed the main problem with this one mainly no other maps and you have to pay to get the female character',
       'It\'s a great game to spend time playing on but I would like the controls to change, their to annoying when I jump I die and am like WOAH... I JUMPED, THOUGH!!! otherwise. Great game.',
       'The game is cool but there\'s a few things that have gone wrong because when my 10 and 5 year old grandchildren  play they say when we try to jump it won\'t let us so it would mean a lot if you changed it a bit',
       'I did it I mean I get my high score and then I died makes no sense right snow total stands but not mad at this game because like I can definitely not beat it it\'s like a fun and active game I would give it like a 5 of I didn\'t die like the heck',
       'It\'s a bordom filler but that\'s about it. Is kind of boring it\'s self but I like it. It\'s a pretty cool game. Good job on the graphics tho. The animations are really nice. The gameplay functions are really simple. I give it a good solid meh' ,

       'Parts of this game are really confusing. I built all the materials to make a ship and they\'re not usable in any way. The quests are also really messed up and once you have nets collecting materials there\'s nothing left to do. Seems like most of the issues with this game would be simple to fix but the developers obviously aren\'t interested in making the game better, just in getting people to click ads. Shame because it could\'ve been a fun game.',

      'Very fun and time killing. I play with my bf and 2 friends and we all try to beat eachothers high scores. It can be pretty competitive. Im prob gonna try to get more ppl to play with me too lol. There could be more variety in the blocks, and there should be like different modes, just an idea',
       'Its cool and all but needs some extra features.  Maybe a way to store 1 brick for later or some level advancement.  Maybe challenges or a power up system. The game is addictive but its very basic. with no real progression path,  other than beating your own high score, it becomes boring.  Still,  thanks for what it is.',
       'What they show on the preview and what it gives you in game don\'t even match. They make it look like it so easy. You cannot rotate the pieces. The pieces they give are so random, and most games you can barely get past a couple of turns before you can\'t place anymore and you lose.',
       'This is very deceiving. It looks like it\'s Tetris, but it\'s not. The pieces don\'t come down like the pictures show. I hate apps like this who deceive people to believe its a certain game when it\'s not just to get people to download. Will never download a game from this developer again.',
       'This app would score a lot better if there was an option to get rid of the adds. If gladly pay to have them gone but that isn\'t an option for some reason. They\'re so intrusive and far too frequent even for a free game. Uninstalling and won\'t be coming back',
       'This game says it has all different types of shapes but it has the same ones from another puzzle game. I think this game was very boring and that you should not download it' ,

       'As a Scrabble purist I rather resent being able to reorganize the board whilst secretly enjoying getting high scoring squares randomly together. The app works well, only a micro improvement but I would ideally like a little more space between the bottom of the board & the playable letters, as if the area\'s crowded it\'s hard to see what\'s what at a glance. All in all great, thanks.',

      'The heroes should be for all players from the lower level. They can make their own choice to choose the hero or switch them. If you provide the better or strongest hero for the strong one, it means the stronger is still the better and even the best. The weaker will have no choice,  but accepting the unfair attack from those strong ones. Please think about it again. Be fair for all players. Otherwise, the stronger or the best ones are still the stronger and the best ones. How about the weak ones? Do they have a chance to use their strategy? It\'s the strategy game, not for only the big or strong players. Thanks!!...',
       'Coc is on the first place in my games list. It is very addictive and enjoyable. I am looking forward till the day town hall 12 comes. I am not much happy with SUPERCELL ID thing. Because it is not much easy to use. I recommend using the normal GOOGLE PLAY sign in method because it is much more appropriate for me. Overall COC have become my life. I also recoomend to have a time limit for coc, like coc automatically switch off if the user plays coc more than 1 hour. Long Live COC!',
       'Awesome strategic game, love it. But I have one request to Clash of clans creators that pls update clan castle of coc village that there would be an option that how much treasury do you want to Transfer to your storage. I think all coc players would be love this option and it would be great idea because you can transfer required amount of treasury to your storage and the rest of it will remains safe in clan Castel. If you like this idea and will work on it then pls reply me. I would be thankful to all Coc creators if that happens.. üòä',
       'NICE GAME, NICE GRAPHICS,NICE GAMEPLAY.. Been Playing Since 2015 and I See A Lot Of Changes..  I Wish new content would Be Added More Frequently and I HOPE The Village must Have Village Houses! Cause A Village Is Not A Village Wihout Houses SUPERCELL. There should be houses that has different colors and traits, some which raises stats of barbs and valks, or reduces time to produce troops and spells like in Builder Base,there should be houses which raises defense or offense and houses which reduces building production. This May Give Clash Of Clans A New Spark and Would Be More Strategic than usual. Thanks For Reading Devs Godbless.',
       'Hey supercell,no doubt your game is awesome but I didn\'t like the supercell id technique in the new update...why did u removed the Google play login system? It was easier to change coc account in it...but in the supercell id it takes a lot of time to change the accounts plus we have to write our email then wait for the password....please fix this issue..... Probably I m not the only one who is facing it......    So I hope that your team can fix this issue..',
       'it\'s a good game and challenging. Strategy is needed on going through battles, Arranging your defenses is very tough to manage lol..... You want to keep away the enemies from your lawn though........ and I love the "Builder hall" when I\'m done on my "Town hall" I manage the second camp.... although the loot in Builder hall is limited it\'s fun and addictive a real time killer........ keep up the good work developers........ have a good day.... ^_¬§' ,

      'This is an awesome game that gives you daily and weekly quest\'s and offers treasure chests. Now they have new levels to play and collect like blazing sands, and the spooky summit level for Halloween. Then they added the new global challenges.This game just keeps growing, not like many of the other games that just stays the same..you will be amazed. Now they added Global challenges, with new head gear...like I said this game keeps growing...it runs so smooth and the graphics are awesome. If you haven\'t tried it. Do it. If you have come back and be amazed at the changes.',
       'Thx for updating Frozen Shadows. Blazing Sands still needs work. Too much water, not enough Sand. Needs a "slide," I recommend sand surfing. The canyons also get boring. The variations between it and the other levels don\'t compare, especially for the gem cost to play it. Still, fun and relaxing, and stays fun. 4/5.',
       'Nice, good, adventure game.but some times your team irritating who one completed thirteen level they will easily get diamond  your giving master challenge ( now the challenge Chinese New year )who one complete your giving thirty diamond only.this offer will useful only for entry level gamers. Most of players finished fourteen level so they no need diamonds.so think about genius players.',
       'I love all the graphics it\'s a bit like the        piano tiles it test\'s your fast skills but except it is temple run 2 love it. Except for the controls though cause sometimes if i turn it to right it goes to left and sometimes it bumps into the tree same to the left you need to fix the controls more.',
       'I love this game, very addicting. And I love that it has the daily, weekly and global challenges. As well as objectives and the daily chest challenges. Lots of things to work for and win. Makes the game more fun. Plus, so far, I haven\'t come across anything that I\'ve had to spend money on in order to advance in the game',
       'All I want Imangi is a reset button,  the ability to start from scratch... Your original allows me to do this when I uninstall and reinstall. Been there,  done that,  would like to do so again but all my collected junk follows me' ,

      'Such a Blast to Play. App never seems to grow boring like some other games. Also the apps not constantly hounding you to spend on Upgrades and Advances which is nice. Your character jumps higher, flips and twirls faster as U advance further. I play it once or twice a day at least. All in All a great/fun app....ENJOY !!',
       'This game is great but I would only rate it a five if there were less adds. Every game I play, as soon as I finished it said "add break". This is very annoying as the adds are up to 30 seconds long. Please get rid of them.',
       'In this game once you have all of the flips it gets really boring. Also there are way to many ad breaks. This game was really fun but now that it\'s newer it\'s boring. It lags to much and kicks me out. I give this 1 star',
       'Ads ads and more ads. And really pushy ads that you can\'t just close straight away too. You spend more time watching ads than playing the game, and honestly you can\'t advance in the game without watching ads for coins anyway, so it\'s basically an advertisement with a mini game in between. Scummy sell out app.',
       'The game desparately needs to offer more coins as skill level increases.  The frequency of coins remains the same while the skill level demands more and more coins (in the thousands).  Watching ads helps, but the player finds themselves doing that exclusively, which defeats the purpose of the game.  Physics, graphics and gameplay are good.',
       'One Of My Favorite Games  So. Let me start of by saying I LOVE it! So I like very few games, in fact nearly no games. But this  game is epic! It\'s interactive, fun, motivate and time killing. But there is one problem and that\'s there are to many adds and most of them are inappropriate' ,

       'Hi everyone!  I\'m really not a fan of this game, I mean it\'s ok I\'m not going to lie but is very boring. The graphics are ok but it is repetitive. I suppose it is quite addictive but I lost interest after a few goes. It wasn\'t my cup of tea so to speak. I hope this review was helpful and remember to give it a big thumbs up!!!

       'I like this game. I purchased it because it deserves, also I want to remove ads. 3,50 ‚Ç¨ and ads are not removed completely. I\'m disappointed, expecially for the "restore purchase" button that not works. Despite this I think that as a game is fun but monotonous in the long run, defect of 90% of apps of this kind. I hope developers will add something with updates that are not other challenges that ofter go to luck (and waiting time should e removed also). Sometimes there are some bugs but irrilevant for gameplay. The development house has made other interesting apps too. Sorry for errors, is not my first language.',

      'Ok, so I will be calm in this review. Whenever I have the same car in a battle with red, we ram each other, but they push me off the map with ease. The main reason why I wrote a review for this game is that you should make the alien levels a little easier. The last level for it is way too hard, you can barely aim at the boss. The controls are hard too. Also can you optimize the game for the Samsung Galaxy tab A?',

      'It\'s another "Shoot Em Up"addictive game. The graphics are üëçüëç Awesomeüëçüëç So is the gameplay. It has that Grand Theft Auto#1üöò feel to it  Along with  Galactica üöÄ,2 of my favorites.  The bonus mission with the üöÅis the $hit, nice way to pick up cash to upgrade your üöò, there\'s really not much I can say bad about this game. The only thing I\'m not to fond of is the ‚¨ÖÔ∏èüöò‚û°Ô∏èaction it be nice if you could move ‚ÜïÔ∏è&‚ÜîÔ∏èto, But then again it might make the game too easy.  Also some of the small side Jobs, like traveling a certain distance for certain amount of‚è± seconds, doesn\'t seem to be working. I don\'t know if it\'s just my game or if it\'s an error in the game But I tried to do them and nothing gets record it for them. It would also be nice if theüíéüíéüíé\'s could show up just a bit more often during play, you know so you can continue after you üî•BLOWüí•UPüî•lol lol. All in all This game gets 4üåü\'s from me and sits pretty close to the üîùof the list of my games to play.  HELL its the only game you can drive a üöóor fly a üöÅüç∫ü•É, shooting at other üöó,‚õü,&üõ•,crash it, üî•üí•üî• it up, and do it all over again JUST FOR FUN!!! Gotta Love It!',

      'OMG! I love the gameplay in this arcade game I love everything about it. It is very cool that you can evolve sharks that can eat more stuff. Keep the updates coming it would be better if you added more sharks in this game . I recommend downloading this game if you want something to do in a long amount of time. This is so addictive I can\'t stop playing it!',
       'My apologies for the negative review lately. But to be honest, I have to use VPN just to log-in in Google Play and enable cloud sync or else, I wouldn\'t be able to sync my progress. Just a little request, can you make the gameplay smoother for lower end devices, such as devices with 1GB RAM? It lags frequently during gameplay. Thanks a lot!',
       'Amazing game. I completed this game in 48 minutes Hahaha! Because I used luckypatcher :) I downloaded the luckypatcher in Googlechrome But it can harm your Device..... And the last shark is Moby dick His baby is as big as Megalodon.',
       'The is the most intense game ever.When you think you\'ve got it ,it\'s gone. Can\'t figure out how to boost. Controls aren\'t the best.Rhis game could improve. Oth er than that it\'s fine I guess.Too many pop up ads. Really frustrating. I want to play the game not look at ads. Sometimes  you can\'t back out of the ad.',
       'i would rate 5 stars... but.. something with the cloud save broke, i used to have the megalodon, without any cheats.. but now i have the mako. could you fix this somehow?',
       'Requiring Google Play Games to save is lame.  It should save my game stats to sd card.   I can not even log in to Google Play Games, so I guess I will never see the good sharks.' ,

      'Great, addictive game! However, real fast, I was wondering how the free box worked. I always hope for something real good but ALWAYS end up with either raw materials or ONE coin. Now don\'t get me wrong, I LOVE getting free stuff, it just seems like the "spinner" purposefully chooses raw materials. Like, it\'s not random like it seems; it never chooses anything close to a weapon! In any case, I cannot play this game enough, very very fun!',
       'Honestly ive been waiting for close to 2 months. This game was like crack for me until the update left me no nice place, no hard earned stuff. I dont mind starting from the bottom again but at least give me some perks. This game is worth every cent and time. But until i get my account back or my stuff back im leaving 2 stars when really this game should be 5 stars all the time. I wont be playing this game til then. Thanks for the good times.',
       'The game doesn\'t load!!! 1.) There\'s nothing wrong with my internet connection! I don\'t have any problems playing RIFT, LOTRO, Neverwinter, Aura Kingdom, Allods Online, etc. or any of my other Google Play apps on my internet connection! 2.) Using Task Manager doesn\'t work! 3.) My device has way more than 200 MB of free space on it! 4.) I haven\'t been able to play for 14 days now!!! 5.) Jurassic Survival looks more promising since there are no loading problems!!!! >:(',
       '**UPDATE** Was an awesome game. Could use a few more perks (ie. Weapons and hard to get items) in drop boxes and yellow zones.Now the down side is if you die in a level your last position is no longer there to try and recoup some of your items. Players killing you as you open trunks in inventory screen. With that I think I am done with this game. Oh ya and the free spin box...give random prizes instead of coins and rope. People will get really into it if perks are awesome.',
       'I love the game. It\'s awesome. But I do have a few questions. Why are the bunker cards so extremely difficult to find? I\'ve been looking for days killing every zombie possible and looking through every crate without finding the cards. Also. Why isn\'t there a disclaimer that says if you die in the game, everything you purchased will be lost? I think that would be extremely necessary so no one over spends their money. Other than that, absolutely smooth running, fantastic graphics, and realistic deaths. I love every aspect except I can\'t find these darn bunker key cards.',
       'This was one of my favorite games... until like many others I lost all progress with the big patch about 6 weeks ago.   Numerous tickets have been submitted over those 6 weeks with zero response, except here on Google play to help them save face.  A lot of my time and money has been robbed.  Proceed with extreme caution.' ,

      'I never EVER been so absolutely in love with a app. I only read about 3 stories and spent $82 for gems and tickets because not only I couldn\'t resist it\'s the least I could do for the creaters for creating such a perfect game that seriously was meant for me in every way possible! (And I NEVER spent money on ANY apps so THAT is how much I LOVE this!) This brings me endless amounts of happiness! It\'s EVERYTHING a story lover could love! üòçüíì AND THERE IS NO ISSUE AT ALL ABSOLUTELY NONE! And I am so not lying when I say NO ISSUE! üòÅ 100/10 game! My only wish is I\'d love for another way to earn gems.',
       'Game is fun. Dont even mind spending money in gens every now and again. But seriously to get the outcome you want, this app is charging waaaaaaay too many gems. Like 50 for one simple choice. And its goes up higher depending on the amount of gems you have. If I pay $5.99 for like 60 gems.. that should get me through and entire story. Not just one chapter. Will delete app if they dont change it. Not gonna spend $40 to finish a story.. Sorry but I think thats outrageous.',
       'This game is really fun! I wish there was a way to restart a story that you are in the middle of or that you could change your appearance or other people\'s appearence at any time. Also when you decide what your character is wearing, sometimes you can\'t see it because dialog is in the way. Also when you choose what you look like. I would prefer it to be against a white background. It\'s hard to see what the darker colors look like.',
       'The stories seem great so far, the app is really nice. But the limiting of how much you can "read" is way over the top. Two short chapters and then a 4 hour wait to get another two. Or buying more chapter tickets. All the actually fun choices are also gated behind premium currency. If it was even a bit less limiting, it would be great. As it is, its fun but annoying.',
       'Really fun, the animation style is adorable but the waiting time is killer! Two short chapters, then you have to wait a ridiculously long amount of time to be able to play more unless you pay. Also the best story options are only available through micro transactions to get more gems to unlock the ability to make certain choices',
       'I like it.  So it\'s really fun and it\'s full of drama! But your options are short because when you have to choose between things, you can only say yes to something IF you have enough gems.But to get gems you have to pay with actual money SO . . . It\'s limited options every single time I play.' ,

      'Most of the controls are excellent, I love the snap-to by selecting a ball, and the fine tune dial, however the "spin" mechanic is terrible to the point of being broken. No matter where you put the contact spot on the cue it is always maximum front spin or back spin, there is no diagonal spin or English, and no gentle spin of any kind. Fix this and you have a perfect pool game.',
       'It\'s not horrible by any means but it\'s basically the children\'s version of what the game should be. Way to basic way too easy and no points and buying system or any sort of upgrades every level just diffs with amount of balls and placement not difficulty Thanks',

       'Really like this game but now at level 563 and it is becoming repetitious. I think I am missing something because at one stage some of the pockets were blocked. There has to be more to this. Anyone help ?',
       'I enjoy playing this game. I already reach level 400 but i don\'t know how many levels this game have. Do you increase the levels every time you update this game until it reach to never ending levels so that no one will stop playing this game because of the never ending levels.

      'Tokens take too long to refill. Level up gives a few coins, why not a token refill? Tournament champion gets 4 tokens. 7 tokens for a day? Cheapskates! When do you want us to play, every 5 days? So cheap in giving prizes, guessing you want us to buy eh? I\'ll give myself a few weeks playing this game and am out. No daily prize wheel, just a daily "less than 20 coins" reward. Sooooooo cheap!',
       'It\'s just ok.  Hard to see your entire hand at times and some of the rules are different than the actual UNO game itself. When I contacted this apps tech support, they sounded as if they could care less and said they will not be making any changes to the game.  So I play until they want me to buy credits then I stop.  When they give me more free credits I play again.  I like the game UNO, just not this one so much.  Why do I still play?  Hmmm, that\'s a good question.',
       'Classic UNO with a couple of modern twists and turns. I have never spent any real money in a game and I don\'t ever plan to, but here you also don\'t really need to. I\'ve won many tournaments and got really far in the game without buying anything. You get extra coins by winning and completing daily tasks, as well as watching ads. But you\'re not forced to watch them. It\'s not just about luck. You have to play smart to win, just like any other card game. I love it.',
       'Great game in the graphics department however, I agree with other consumers when they say the special abilities you can obtain by playing this game ruins it. Simple is best and this uno app is anything but. Sometimes when I log in, the tokens don\'t even recharge overnight and I have to wait a few more hours before I play three free rounds of uno before you have to pay for more tokens. Very hit and miss app.',
       'Okay, this is actually a decent game HOWEVER unless you buy your way through its almost impossible to win tournaments.  They shouldn\'t be putting people in the "club" and level 100+ with people who are like level 10 and not in this "club" it makes it almost impossible for them to win unless they\'re INSANELY lucky.  People with cheats can turn you from being at uno and winning, to being in last place in seconds and it honestly just kills the enjoyment of the game',
       'Greatest game ever~~¬§mean it.  The Updated game even better.  Need to be easier to play with Friends that you JUST made ~~maybe REPLAY!!!  üò¨ üò≤ üò† üòê üò≠  Friends where are you? Great for tablets.   I am UNO happy . Happy New years  .Oh don\'t terminate the game unless you just have to, I well try finding something other to do. Nothing Good ever lasts anyway.   Thanks for reading.  UNO POWER.' ,

There are some outfits that are locked and you have to wait too long, and that is why I rated it 4 stars. For someone who says "too many notifications", go to the settings and turn off that notifications button. Thank you for those hate critics you guys made. It really teached me a lesson.',
       'It\'s been more than a year that you haven\'t added any mini game in any update. You\'ve written on "What\'s New" section that "We\'re working on something big" but you .haven\'t shown that big work yetüòÖ..At least add more mini games...And I\'ll rate 5.',
       'I wish you didn\'t have to wait for a long time for a item. Like, for example, if a hat was level 60. Then you have to wait for a long time. Please instead of doing levels. Please just make them expensive. Because you need to wait.',
       'I love this app so much. I thinks its good that you can buy things for Pou and play games with friends  Pou is cute when\'s its a baby. I like that you can buy. Clothes and all sorts of stuff. I like the mini games they are fun too. I think that you. Would improve on making the things that were locked a little bit lower priced' ,

      'Whenever you die in the game you start completely over again. And after each game an advertisement plays. Wish there could a 5 second skip button like YouTube does, especially you guys advertise every time after you die/end a game.  The graphics are cool, love the neon colors. It\'s a game for all ages!!! My kids and my husband and I all play this game. It\'s very competitive!!! I swear my husband can\'t beat my score no one has lol',
       'It\'s good but not what I would play on daily basis..... it\'s my opinion so don\'t get mad. The controls are OKAY and I think they add more stuff to the game, I don\'t have any ideas for it though. This game is great and in the people like it but for me I wouldn\'t play it all the time on a road trip. Keep up the good work though! üòÄüòÄüòÄ',
       'It is soooooo addictive and also VERY awesome. The only problem is that because people go on the game on their phone\'s or tablets I find it hard to control I don\'t know if anyone else thinks so but that\'s my opinion. Pls no hate anyway, Peace out and the reason it is like slither.io is bc it is by the same company',
       'Great game can be addictive with no real goal but to eat others poop as me and my daughter call it and other worms to grow bigger. Top notch comical game EVER that you wont be able to stop. Only set back is that the game gets extremely extremelylaggy on addroid tablets and on the online game interface',
       'start to crash often when playing online. i think it need some sounds or music. playing silent for long time feels like going stupid after long time played. since it so addictive . keep repeating boring play but keeps ppl playing. is fun though, but I think everyone need to keep control how much time played. can\'t believe I can play for like hours haha. don\'t know why my Nick name don\'t show anymore. usually is \'eat uuu\'. but shows as nothing ____ now.',
       'Worst game played ever . Too irritating , so many adds . Very disappointed . I was just seeing the ratings and I thought it will be good but after that I got very much angry. PLEASE NEVER DOWNLOAD THIS GAME. Slither.io is much better game than this one. Worst game controls' ,

      'Two big things hurt this otherwise great and fun idea:. 1) projects are not saved in progress!  If you leave one unfinished and go back to it, you have to start all over! 2) there are not enough tools/ways to get at all the pieces in the more complicated patterns. There are other minor things. ... I will say the positives.  This is unique and a good and fun idea!  The designs and colors are very nice!  I did not have a single crash so it is very stable!  There seemed to be a fair amount of ones to do with the free version.  Ads were not any worse than others that use this model.',
       'In general it\'s a fun game but the controls aren\'t easy to control/get use to and aren\'t smooth. There aren\'t many new drawings every day either. What I like is that some of the ones where you need to pay you can watch an ad to unlock it. It\'s also a great time killer.',
       'It is quite cute and you can even do the ones that need you too pay by watching an ad. They are quite detailed and you can rotate around unlike some other apps. When I was moving around, the controls were a bit slippery, but it was a big upgrade from other apps. I recommend you download it if you like medium difficulty pixel art, although there are a few simpler ones.',
       'Great stress reduction game I had to lower my rating because my game is having trouble scrolling down the list. I don\'t get far and it\'ll put me back at the top of the list. Please fix this problem so I can go back to five stars... thanks',
       'This is rlly fun I love the part where u can see like a type of slideshow of when u were coloring it and starts off of nothing then fills in the areas u filled in when coloring . This game is REALLY FUN mostly if u have nothing to do just color it\'s satisfying and fun! Also when u are bored this helps u! This game is fun and addicting!',
       'I. Love the app in the fact that you can turn the pictures all around makes me love you even more because there is not very many as I could find this good I don\'t think I can find any answers. In fact the only thing I don\'t really like is it controls cuz it makes my hand hurts really bad because the way they\'re Controller made with these two fingers am and I like when you swipe you have to go back over when I think you\'re staying in one place when you swipe to make it go around' ,

Maybe add a driver cause that make it more realistic and maybe a few new cars  and definitely some people walking around doing random stuff. And maybe fix the sensitivity unless I missed that. So yeah really enjoyed thisüòÄüòÅüòÄüòÅüòÄüòÅ.',
       'I think you guys have messed up your game in the past few updates. Seems like there is some memory leak or something. After a while the steering wheel lags so much. Only the input. Graphics don\'t lag at all. Please fix. Also would be great if you could add some button to start and stop a timer in free mode so we can set time challenges for ourselves. I like the game but it is unplayable after a few minutes after the recent updates',

Please fix this!',
       'This game was just really really good! But please please make the exact same game but instead, if you do something illegal like crash into another car, the cops start chasing you. If you do do this I will comment on every single game that comes up on the adds. But, there is a tiny bit to much adds. Anyways, AMAZING fame!!!üòä',

      'I have only had this game for a few days, so I can\'t write a very comprehensive review just yet. But I have good feeling about this game. It is fun, challenging, with easy-to-learn controls. Less fast paced than Dragon SIM and less worlds and bosses. Customization is better though, and slower pacing may mean more long-term fun; not over so fast. Multiplayer is always a plus. Not pay-to-play, though paying gets you more benefits, it\'s up to you how you want to go about getting coins and acorns. Great game, few problems, would recommend.',
       'Man i love this game!!! So much better than wolfquest!!! I do hope tht this game soon be added new things like more animal to play as, better in performance. The ad free guys...keep it up!!! Just wondering if there\'s a add as mate system in multiplayer in the future? Anyways....this is the best wolf game tht i played!!! Do hope tht you guys one day add more animals to play as (like a snow leopard for example)',
       'On one of the quest, I think 11. There ia a syrange new animal and I went to the game menu for information and there wasn\'t any. It looks like a brown rabbit, I tried killing Rabbits squirrels and deer, but It wasn\'t the right animal! Is it in the snow biome?  Anyways hope you can help me and otger quest 11 users. It\'ll be great that when you get the same animal twice it counts as duplicate. For example "Wolf Common Duplicate +(however acorns). Thanks and the update is great!',
       'Could you add more animals to play as? And a world idea could be a dessert. I love this game, and the others you\'ve made, so I know you will make awesome updates soon! Keep up the good work. If you fixed the glitch were you eat and jump at the same time you fly, if you fixed that can you please put it back. It was fun... XD',
       'It just lags now. The new update made it to where my chat, my character, and my animations won\'t work. I run about as fast as a turtle, and I am not pregnant. Please fix!!!! I love this game. I have a few questions if you don\'t mind... Can you guys add in multi-player mode, like single player mode, that we can pick up our pups, it would be cool to add that option in the top left menu. Thank you guys so much!! Love the games!!',
       'I LOVE THIS!!!!!!! thank you, thank you, thank you! This game is so amazing. Are you going to add more creatures though? Maybe like wild chickens or somthing? And with the deer, I think they should run away from you like rabbits, cuz deer in real life deer run away from wolves and lynx.  I would also like it if you made a horse/pegusis/unicorn game(s) as well. That would be amazing.' ,

      'I\'ll keep this short, this game was way better when players were able to buy things like the hearts (lives), small and large boosts 750m and 1500m, and other items like this. I have since started to play this again after getting a new phone and this game has changed a lot. Although I like the new power-ups, it wouldn\'t hurt to bring back the old ones as well, and by that I mean allow players to buy more lives, boosts etc.   I hope the developers can make this happen, although I\'m only one person so they will not listen and probably couldn\'t care less what I think, but listening to the customer (or player of your game in this case) would probably work out quite well.',
       'I love this game. It\'s pretty old, but amazingly, still one of the best games on a mobile device. It\'s unbelievably addicting, which is quite a problem.. üòÇ But I love this game so much, and I play it everyday. Keep it up, Halfbrick Studios! I\'ve been playing this game since I was about 5, so sorry for the late rate. üòÑ',
       'Pretty good game. It\'s a really fun game to play, and a great killer time. But it has way too many ads. It also tells you to spend a lot of real life money, to the point that is ridiculous. Like, having to pay to be able to use a third slot. Really???',
       'The ads are disgustingly invasive and annoying as they follow most playthroughs. The game itself is quite enjoyable. Id honestly pay to have them removed, but does not seem an option. If ya dont like ads, dont play this game',
       'I love this game. It could be improved though, I think that during missions where you have to do a certain amount of something in one game (for example, ride 500m on the hog in one run, or collect 4 tokens in one game) there should something that tells you how much of that thing you have done during gameplay. This would be super helpful so you don\'t have to count yourself. Also to those who are complaining about ads, I simply turn off my WiFi when I am playing (this prevents ads) and I turn it back on to do the S.A.M challenge.',

      'I don\'t have any problem with the game but the problem is that I don\'t like that miniclip is adding the bot because the game is less popular or don\'t know but to win against a bot is very tough you cannot win a match against them.

I have shut my phone down and turned it back on but I\'m not going to do that for every time I want to get on the app. I do really love it. It\'s just that it freezes so I can barely play it.' ,

      'Overall, the game is OK . But there is a few issues. My bike tips back and I can\'t stop it from tipping back until I die. But this doesn\'t happen all the time. It happens about every five weeks. Also, I was given a 5$ gift card and a 10$ gift card but I can\'t buy any of the bikes.',
       'Been playing for a few years and absolutely love the game.  Got a new phone, Moto G5 Plus, and now there is a half second pause every time I hit the gas or break in every race.  Extremely annoying when you\'re racing friends.',
       'Bugs and Glitches... Multiplayer links are not being sent back and forth properly. Some games keep giving me desert level 1 and not showing any replays or ghost bikes are doing a different levels then the one I am suppose to be racing against. Please Fix!!!',
       'Game is challenging and highly  addictive.  My four year old uploaded this game to my phone and I made fun of him and now I can\'t stop playing it',
       'why is it all the good games have update such as this and with it comes a bombardment of adverts that ure completely unnessesary. i have now deleted this game as a result. stop the flooding of ads within games. its now always about squeezing every penny you can from them. the enjoyment is now gone.',
       'Lost all of my bikes when I re-download the app. It shows the 500+ wins I have, but I don\'t even see a way to get the basic ones unlocked again without paying for their stupid VIP package. It sucks that they ruined this app, looking at the iOS version its obvious they haven\'t bothered to update this in years.' ,

      'I played it a long time ago and i stopted like 5 months ago. Then now i reinstalled it and:  1. I could not enter my acc  2. I could not connect to facebook or google play.  3. I had to pay each time i danced wich sucks.  Till that update this game was the best game/app ever. It was so fun and so great that I just wanted to play nonstop.  I mean before this big update u payed for a song and u could dance on it as much as you liked. Now it just ain\'t fun anymore.   Please return to the classic game or your gonna lose much much more players like me.',
       'I like it, I use it to exercise and have fun with my sister. Only question I have is: How accurate is the kcal Burned counter? I played for over an hour and I am told I burnt 1,252 KCals. I question the accuracy of this. You update the game often, so can you put in the game somewhere the average calories the song the user is choosing to play burns? That is my biggest concern. Otherwise, no issues. Fun, easy to use. Great way to get exercise in all the while enjoying it with family and friends.',
       'It\'s fun to do and this game is perfect for me because I love to dance. Dancing is my favorite thing to go when I\'m bored. I love the songs and dance moves it\'s awesome to play and do. Thx for making this game cause now I can do more dancing and dance moves. You guys should download this game for you new people cause it\'s awesome to learn but in a fun way. So if you suck and don\'t know how to dance then you should download this game it\'s perfect for you if you want to know how to do simple but hard dancing moves.',
       'Game is good as all just dance video games. Daughter enjoyed it until noticed that she had only a few dances then had to wait. There should be at least a shorter time to wait. Or some sort of option to earn more coins. Because 2 videos weren\'t enough. And one of them didn\'t work because the connection was lost. Again game was okay as for game play. But not sure its a keeper.',
       'Honestly, the game is great. It loads good, has amazing graphics and is easy to play. However the credits situation is absolutely retarded. I feel as if we shouldn\'t have to wait twenty-four hours to play ONE dance then wait again or pay $2.99 per DAY just to dance. You should at least have a page of good free dances for when someone has nothing to do!',
       'I really enjoyed playing this... Or at least the two songs I was able to play based on the coins that I had. My only criticism so far is that there should be ways to earn coins other than waiting so long for refills, watching ads, or buying coins. This strict control on earning coins doesn\'t make this a great game to play with a group of friends (though I know that you can buy VIP passes which are valid for a limited amount of time). It would add to the game play (as well as the overall experience of the game) if coins could be earned during the game in power ups or when you get perfect scores. This would give incentive to keep playing, let the games potentially last longer, and add to the competitiveness between players to enhance gaming fun.' ,

      'I really wish you guys didn\'t update it. It truthfully bugs me that I can\'t listen to the full song on the menu anymore. The songs are absolutely amazing and the game is very addictive. I hope you will update the game again so that we can just sit and listen to these master pieces if we wanted. Thanks for an awesome game!',
       'Amazing game... Loved it...üòç The tunes are AWESOME!!!  And Bryan swag zone At first even I thought that But... It is a maze so it\'ll obviously be twisted... (No Hate) It is actually that you should click maybe after the third or fourth turn to get it right... Even I took time to understand that So it\'s okay üòä',
       'It\'s an amazing game. Sure I run around my bedroom screening every time I fail next to the end.... but there is something about this game that makes you happy. Is it the music? Maybe. Is it the back ground and the way it moves?possibly. It\'s all of those things plus more   In a nut shell I really really really really really really really really really love this game :p',
       'Good songs. That\'s about it. The hitbox detection and lag spikes are horrific, the checkpoint system is a blatant cash grab, and what annoys the most is that the timing of music+taps (the core mechanic of the game) is completely broken. It is significantly easier to play the game with audio off, so that you don\'t get distracted by the miss timed turns. Doesn\'t even fulfill it\'s most basic selling point. Atrocious.',
       'This is by far my favourite mobile game to date. Loads of fun and not covered with ads like every other game out there (while there is a few this one isn\'t as bad). My only complaint is the new continuation thing. That wasn\'t there but now it\'s forced me to watch ads even though I played to remove ads.',
       'The gameplay is unique, but one thing I notice that is so hard to get the highest level as we totaly have no idea about the beat from music while we play it. Need to play the same level on and on until I become familiar with every single beat from it. Anyway, use your best headphone. They come with so much beautiful musics you\'ll ever heard' ,

      'I mean the game in itself is......alright  it could be a lot better.  I think the controls are rubbish and I understand it\'s meant to be "skillfull" but thats harder than skillfull, you can\'t even see where the circle is, this also adds to the game being bad. Having said all this you have also added rubbish music..... like you could have put something decent on. I get even more of an urge to uninstall the game every time I play it. Overall I definitely do NOT recommend this game. Game developers I hope you read this as it will probably help you to make the game better. I understand it would take a while but I don\'t care. If any of the game developers want to feedback on my feedback you are welcome to.Thank you.',
       'Why I liked it? Because it\'s a simple game that doesn\'t make you addicted to phone but rather enjoy going forward focusing your attention entirely on your finger. What comes to music as I read in comments, I always play games without music so haven\'t listened to this game\'s. I play this game as a reward after working hard and I\'m entirely satisfied. There have been no crashes so far. Lots of ads, though.',
       'This is game is ok if you are bored and don\'t know what to do.... however it becomes irritating after playing for a while.... overall its a nice game',
       'I would like to report a bug. When you pause the game, moving obstacles keep moving. Someone would use this as a cheat',
       'This is the best game to relax. But i have a problem i do i change the music there are some music that i like and i want only that to play so i request ro put a music option  Thank you',
       'It\'s a good game not that much ads great controls and concept people just rage and rate it bad. keep up the good work' ,

      'I really love this game. I love voting and seeing what other have also come up with. I love that it is really world design where you can actually shop for pieces and not cartoon rubbish. However, I have had a number of issues where the game has had to restart and have even lost diamonds and cash after trying to collecting daily rewards when it re starts, watching endless adds and not receiving rewards for them or downloading other useless games I have no interest in and actually playing them to generate rewards and not receiving them either. These are my only issues with the game. Other than these it would be five stars.',
       'The game is fun, but results take 2 and 3 days and if other people are on higher levels they have access to better tableware and vases, pictures etc, so their rooms stand out more and they have a better chance at getting 5 stars. And some items I\'ve purchased don\'t work it gives a message saying they couldn\'t find it in the warehouse. But the game never gave me my gems back and of money. NEED TO FIX IT',
       'O.k. the game has been fun. Love decorating. My gripe is why can\'t I keep the furniture that I have purchased with my own money? And why do I have to repurchase items that I have already bought? And why am I limited on purchasing if I spend my own money.  You guys say that you don\'t enhance the voting process but I tend to differ. Many times rooms that have scored A 5 are all in the same color tones and almost look the same. It has been fun but unless you give me more options to purchase I\'m? out.',
       'Great game! Love it! Only voting system is not accurate. I think  designs that not reflecting the theme should not get  5 stars. It would be nice to have experts inside the game who will review designs for THEME and reward those who follow the theme and get great result  in designing. I suggest to  give one point for those who is following theme, and get one point out if someone not. Fairness is important.',
       'Entertaining, enjoyable and inspiring! Brings out  your creativity in utilizing your available resources and in maximizing your limited funds. The game makes you travel around the globe.  Hope to seeing homes from less popular countries. Sad to note that there are times that free diamonds don\'t add up after watching the videos and there are items not found in the warehouse.',
       'I really love this game! It surely brings out my passion in interior designing, nourish my mind as i see others works, getting inspired also to continue want i really love in life, which is designing/art. And it does help me to chill or relax whenever im depressed bcoz it makes me think what to design, and helps me get out of the stress that life brings. It indeed help me with my mental and emotional instability. 5 stars for this! Number 1 app for me. Never failed my expectations. LOVE IT!' ,

      'I think there should be option of chatting with guild members and other players not voice chatting but message ones.  There should be some research option in every guild or either there should be some Commander talent points by which we can increase some of the tactics of team & player.  Main Idea :  I think there should be some event in which 2 guilds can fight with each other & there should be option of ally & others.  I know it\'s kinda different game but it will make fun to game.   Overall this game is best and addictive,  Thanks for making this game.  Great effort by dev team.  Love you.',
       'The game itself is awesome, the gameplay is awesome. However I\'d suggest to make the following changes to make the game better. First I\'d add an event each week which would allow players to play different matches like training with bots or zombie apocalypse and many more. I know his might be hard but I\'m also recording free fire  for my YouTube channel ( Natan Prokop ) and trying hard with it. So it would be nice if you also added ladders and so you could climb to like buildings and towers. I\'d  also add revolvers, at least one type. Please sub to my channel and if you could add the things above that\'d be great',
       'This game is good fun but pls can u stop peoee from running u over as when 8 get in top 3 some keeps running me over. It\'s still and amazing games but when people run u over its boring and wish u could stop people from doing this   is th8nkthere u should maybe be able to drive places but when u want to fight they have to get out and shoot and have a proper gun fight . Overall this is a great game my favourite mobile game and it\'s really enjoyable. But pls can u make people not being able to do this. Thankyou',
       'I\'ve been facing a new issue. I always used to get a ping of around 140 - 180 ms with my Jio until day before yesterday. But, since then, I\'m always getting a ping of 300+ ms. This is really annoying. Close combats are pretty impossible. I\'ve checked everything. My network is fine. I get a better ping in other online games which I play. My friends have been facing this issue as well. So, it has become harder to play squad and duo matches as well. Please do something about this Garena. I would definitely drop a 5 star then.',
       'great game!  i love the game, its a great game to pass time, with epic moments like a random dancing gun and etc. I have played other games like this on my phond i still prefer FF. BG, the update was also good love the addition of the grenade. 1 thing that would be good to add is a chat box when players are still in lobby. I would have given this 5 star but There are still bugs and glitches',
       'One of the biggest online game I ever played...Graphics is a bit low and others are awesome... The Main thing I like in this game is the voice chatting with team mates... Commonly Only PC games has this program but now Android also has... And again i am saying that graphics could be a bit more good and I love playing this... Its a great game' ,

      'I never pay for supplies in these types of games but with this one there\'s no point in playing anymore if I don\'t. You simply can\'t earn enough coins to keep playing. Additionally their ratios for resources are all over the place. I often found it didn\'t make sense to use the "higher" option when a lower faster option was more cost effective. I will be deleting now at level 6',
       'It\'s definitely an adorable game and is one of the few games of this kind that has reasonable "waiting" times for stuff! :)  Sadly... There\'s one Major issue I have with the game and it is the constant notification to link Facebook with the game, which of course also has some great rewards locked behind it as well. :P I don\'t have a Facebook profile and it\'s incredibly unfortunate that there\'s no other alternative to choose (especially when there\'s plenty to choose from these days) Those are the reasons why I rate only three stars.',
       'Great game, shame is so heavy on the pay to progress.  Everything takes far to looking and not enough storage.  The option to build a stiff warehouse would be great.  Otherwise fun and engaging.',
       'Lovely game quite relaxing to play but the cost of food and money on quests is so excessive. And bonus quests that distract you...and cost. Reminds me of animal crossing but heavy on the purchase to progress',
       'It would be nice if the wait for resources didn\'t drag out for so long, you should be able to advance a little faster considering how large the map is for this game. But it\'s cool how you have to use a  combination of different resources to achieve rewards, but like I read in the comments I also feel you don\'t get much of a reward considering how much time you put into achieving them.',
       'It\'s an ok game. Not what i thought it would be.  Actions take a lot of energy and do not recoup quickly. Rewards arent the greatest.' ,

      'I know a lot of people seem to not like this game but I actually really enjoy it the only thing I don\'t like is the lack of sound.   It would be nice if there was background music of some kind and a glass breaking sound effect when you went through each barrier something pleasing to the ears  Oh and shorter ads would also probably be good.  It could also use more roads and balls and barriers to work towards. I feel like this game has a lot of potential though hope it keeps being updated.',
       'This is a very addictive game. I don\'t understand why people don\'t like it. Fast paced. As for the adds, you people should turn your internet off and play. It will help.. ##VOODOO## Would you accept a video from me? You can use it for advertising purposes. I thought it might be of great help for you.  Please get back to me by replying. I would be happy to email the video to you..',
       'The game is fine. But OMG the ads....they make you watch an ad every few seconds until you pay for the premium version. This is just sick. I mean games do have ads but the number of ads in this game are unbearable. Very frustrating . So if you are looking for a free game THIS IS NOT IT.',
       'Hey Developer! This is Great Job!. But, if there are other players who have the disease "Afraid of Heights", this game will not be suitable for him. You make players Cringe (Afraid), because there is no music. This game like a Dark Theme Games.',
       'Well it\'s an ok game however I find it fascinating how people can design a game like this and think it\'s so good that they can pack it with adds. Make a better game and then you can pack it with adds. This game shows a lack of dedication to the product. All I see is another game where you tried to dig as much money out of it as possible from adds and then forgot about it.',
       'The game is very enjoyable, and it\'s pleasing to the eyes. I like that you can fall off course and redeem yourself if you make it back within 5 seconds. The ads are pretty excessive though. I\'m all for supporting a free to play game with advertisements, and at first I didn\'t have a problem with the ads. You get an advertisement after every game but they\'re often just picture ads or skippable after 5 seconds. I draw the line when you go e me an ad after every game and there are 30 second ads that you\'re forced to watch. If you\'re going to make me watch an ad give me an ad every 3 to 5 games at least.' ,

      'This game is AMAZING I think its  suitable for any age because its entertaining and it doesn\'t have a lot of adds which is really cool since this game is free. It also has a variation of different puzzles to keep u entertained. I think that if u r reading this right now then DOWNLOAD IT NOW.',
       'This is actually quite addictive & enjoyable. Definitely distracts you & helps kill time or zone out when your brain is too busy. My daughters, (16 yrs & 5 yrs) along w my son (12 yrs) play w me, and we try to race each other thru the levels. I would give this wee game 5 stars if it weren\'t for the amount of ads & the length of time the ads play. If the ads were adjusted a wee bit it would be easier to do the side by side races. Hope y\'all üëç it.',
       'I abseloutly love this game. The controls are amazing the games are great and it is so stress relieving and I would play this in every second of my spare time. I would totally reccomend this for kids and adults!!! Go and get this free app that I am addicted to üòÄüòç',
       'This game has everything: any puzzle game you could imagine organized into well-staggered difficulties, unlockable content that can all be earned for free, regular updates... The only annoying thing is the ads that play every few levels but I liked the game so much I spent the $2.50 to get rid of them.',
       'It\'s an amazing app with great puzzles. Though there\'s so many ads and recently the app started crashing every time I try open the app and try to do a puzzle. I hope this problem is fixable without having to reinstall and start over.',
       'Great app saw it from an ad and I don\'t regret getting it.  The only thing  I dislike is that there are too many ads but other than that u should download  this right now üòÅ' ,

      'Game is getting better with being fair. Free to play people can actually roll decent heroes after a while with persistence. IGG is still unbelievably money hungry for their newest released things - but I guess it\'s better to wait for everything or pay for it upfront. I chose option 1. Thank you IGG for making rolling a little more fair.',
       'I\'ve played for 3 years and this game has just gone way downhill, this is the biggest pay to win game that exists. It\'s enjoyable to see people have the ability to buy what I worked so hard during the last 3 years for a mere $10. I haven\'t enjoyed this game in months, it\'s a chore to still play. Download only if you\'re willing to drop a fortune.',
       'nice game for the others saying that this is a copy of coc it has a lot of difference this game is more easy to play than coc. coc is a hard game more time o upgrade more time on things in this in only 5 m its fast becouse it is free and you already have a hero if you start the game in coc you ned to be th lvl 7 to get it or 8 idk but dont say that coc an cc is the same becouse your wrong of saying that they are the same (^_^)',
       'OMG This app is annoying in all ways... And on Certain hack things I play this for 30 seconds but still don\'t get a pass! Tell CoTops to give me my credits',
       'Lol I\'m changing my review once more. I love the game but every new hero you guys drop completely messes up the game and makes things unfair. I don\'t know if your way of trying to fix it is by making more OP heroes but it simply makes the game less enjoyable. The last few heroes that came out completely made my account useless and if I don\'t put in a good couple hundred dollars is just gonna stay useless. I think that\'s unfair so for now I\'m taking off a few stars. I know you guys don\'t care but its the only thing I can do to express my opinion. In my humble opinion you guys should balance the useless heroes you already have rather than coming up with new ones that make the old ones  useless.',
       'DO NOT ENTER!!!!  Unless you have thousands of dollars lying around and burning a hole in your pocket, do not bother! This game takes care of p2w (play to win) players and it is getting borderline impossible for f2l (free to lose) players to catch up and the gap is just getting bigger by the day.... its ridiculous!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Edit: After 4 years of playing this game I have finally thrown in the towel.... I loved this game, and maybe I still do, but you guys make it bloody impossible to play anymore  (*Queen playing in backround* ...another one bites the dust)' ,

      'Lemme just say ketchapp your games are soooo good!! And addictive including this one it\'s fun and ever since the first play I\'ve been hooked there are barely any adds and the graphics are phenomenal. I play it all the time plz don\'t change this, if u do your going to loose my five starsüåüüåüüåüüåüüåü.',
       'Most of my apps are from Ketchapp. Their creativity and style of games have just been wanting me to download more and more! Right now, Ketchapp is one of my most favourite game groups ever! Keep making more! I don\'t have any improvements, which means that their games are top notch!',
       'Patheitc. Being such a fast paced game you cannot have the blocks starting to move a split second before you\'re going to pass it. Makes the game pretty impossible from the first level. For something that was supposed to be fun, is more frustrating. You need severe luck on your side to get a win. Recommended do not download',
       'Its a good concept, but you need to update it, and make sure the blocks no longer move. Right now, it is by far the most luck based skill game. It is impossible to dodge the moving blocks, so if they are to move, they should move much slower',
       'Good, but difficulty is a bit tough. Unless I was a Jedi, it feels like I\'m starting on what should be a hard level. The AI is way too slow as well. I wish you could could change the color of your ball and race online with others in real time.',
       'I think it is a great way for amiee to get design for her Xbox 360 and help her get over with her anger with her sister and to help her to figure out what\'s the matter but what is the most important thing is to be a fantastic family together but why are we so lonely.... Well i think it is a great opportunity to make new friends to life' ,

      'The ball is super hard to control. Half the time I\'m swiping over and over again just to make the ball move. The game acts like it is super easy when it is the hardest task to do. I\'m also being spammed with ads because once or twice you restart the level because you lost an ad plays. Plys the ads take me to Google Play without me touching the screen or tapping on download. And since the controls are a nightmare because of lines glitching around the ball, (thus making it not move a single centimeter) I have to watch an ad. or lines just glitching themselves. And finally, this game spams me with notifications to "thumbs up" you and download your other games. I\'m obviously NOT INTERESTED IN PAYING YOU WITH ADS!',
       'The ads are forced onto you, and that is the worse system I\'ve seen yet. The controls are pretty good if you have an s pen. Most puzzles are way to easy.',
       'Don\'t get me wrong this game is fun and gets your brain thinking but I hate how many adds it has. Plus every time an add comes up it takes me straight to Google play with out me even tapping on it. It gets annoying. Another thing I don\'t like about this game is after a certain amount of levels you have to watch a video (add again) just to unlock more levels. And it does this more than once to. On the flip side it is a good game that gets the brain running and the levels do get more challenging throughout.',
       'I thik its a good game at first when you don\'t know how to do it you want to delete it but if you keep on playing you get the hang of it and well love it please make  ore levels and less adcs',

However, the advertising is a horrible and annoying part of the app, and probably borderlining app guidelines. When the advertisement is on between rounds, they block your entire UI, and there\'s nothing you can do to shut it down. They will frequently stream video, which can easily consume your entire allowed data from your telephone company. This is NOT how you should provide games, free or not.',

      'I would rate it a 5 because I absolutely love the game. However, I tried to make a purchase and the money was taken out of my account and yet got screwed over with the currency in the game seeing as how NOTHING CAME THROUGH! So I lost out on money and didn\'t get anything in return.',

      'This is a great game but it has it\'s draw backs. Due to a glitch in the game I had some coins and trophies taken from me in a game that never loaded. The biggest issue with this game is there is no offline solo play. A solo or practice mode would be great to allow people to get a feel for the game and be able to make tweaks in certain scenarios when playing with others. Easily worth 5+ stars if some adjustments can be made. Very addictive, very fun and suspenseful, and a great time killer.',
       'Game seems fine as long as you DO NOT BUY ANYTHING!!. Game is so rigged and its about the most obvious Ive ever seen. Just before tourney time, you will not make a shot and you will be reduced to ZERO coins, balls and trophies. I have over 10,000 matches so I know the game and support very well. DO NOT BUY BALLS, COINS HEARTS OR ANYTHING ELSE FROM PLAYDEMIC.',
       'I think that you should win the balls all so instead of just trophies!! You pay so much money to qualify for a tournament and you got to pay a 10,000 dollar entry fee and then 1000 ever hole!! The game is coming to how much you can spend instead of how good you are you shouldn\'t be able to enter a rookie tournament if you have over a thousand trophies!! Maybe it shouldn\'t cost so much to be able to get into the tournament!!! Besides if you spend a lot of money the people who can\'t spend as much!! I enjoy this game a lot I play it all the time I believe that it should be cheaper to qualify for the tournament!! And when you lose your game that you should loose the ball your playing with!! I really appreciate your time in listening to my opinion!! Hopefully this might make it a little more fair to the people who can\'t spend the money they would like!! Sincerely a Huge fan of the game!!! Thanks Joseph',
       'Awesome game. The only thing I don\'t care for is, why am I playing people that have 80 trophies but have played 2,000 games? I mean I\'m working with starter clubs and they are playing me with so much better clubs.. I just don\'t think that\'s very fare. And is there any other way possible to receive extra gems and coins or get extra clubs higher-ranking clubs? Thank you for your time and thank you for coming out with this game it is awesome',
       'Fun and entertaining game for sure. I wish there was more variety of courses, but I enjoy the competition in this a lot. They update frequently, and have very helpful customer service. One small change I\'d make, on shootouts, if it could show your distance from the pin next to your name or vice versa. I\'d like to see different clubs available for purchase as well.',
       'Really a great experience! The game play is awesome and very addicting. Only issue I have is when I finish in the weekly division standings I am not receiving my rewards. I just placed 3rd and was supposed to get a golden chest but I did not receive anything. That was a little disappointing after investing all that time, but still one of the best apps I have ever downloaded.' ,

      'I used to love this game, very addictive but recent updates have made the game have too many elements (clubs - who cares???) Ads all over and money disappears quickly due to cost of each game.  Not easy to complete games it feels "fixed" with random cards plus drains the battery on my phone.  Uninstalled.',
       'This is my 3rd review. Love the game but had issues when ads were introduced. That was rectified, then had issues with new Android version. That was fixed and game was going fantastically for about 3 weeks and now they have reduced the amount of free treasure to $1000 instead of $5000. This means I need to come back 3x more often without playing a single game just to be able to play once.',
       'This game is fun, it is addicting. However because of the constant changing and the unfair advantages that some players get (not everyone has the same events, quests, or in game things) it\'s becoming less and less appealing. And the multiple device fix is a joke! EVERYONE had that advantage you they took it! Dumb!',
       'Originally I really liked this game BUT the further you go the  more it costs to play.  That was ok, but you add more and more ads in there, they are on the "boards" they are between the games, between the levels and NOW you have Tri Peaks Solitaire brought to you by, yet another game. I like it, as a game it\'s addictive and was  fun but I think I have had enough.  It\'s becoming not so much fun and headed for the uninstall list.',
       'I am, \'absitively, posolutely\', ( if you get it, you\'re awesome ) addicted to Solitaire TriPeaks. I, almost every time, play until my phone\'s battery dies. I, then, as if I accidentally unplugged my "life support", anxiously plug in my phone. Then, impatiently, wait until it\'s charge is at 3%. Just to continue playing... Smh. God forbid, I don\'t have my charger with me. I am just miserable then lol',

      'I really liked the action scene where the ICE police arrested the mommy and took her children into social services. I do believe giving an emergency C-section for an illegal is a bit much for a story line, but whatever. Totally makes sense. I love how we\'re able to take care of the premies and foster them until they\'re adopted! 6/10 - Would play again if bored.',
       'When ever I close it and open again we need to complete all levels again.  Worst',
       'It sucked the mother getting arrested we having to take care of it is all a lie and it was like the worst game ever it could take you four minutes to play literally',
       'I hate this game you can barely use it half of the stuff sont even work and its so boring you could find bette games with coco play',
       'It was realy fun but I think  you should be able to choose what the mom looked like and the babies and choose if you wanted a girl or a boy and choose what teddies you wanted to give them like a rabbit toy or a dog toy but apart from that it was great. Thank you so much.',

      'lnstaII \'VEARN\' App Enterr (CRETA) to Start Earning So far so good.Fun way to get money. Won\'t make you rich but the extra cash is helpful. It\'s also the best exchange rate on points. McEarn points equals mc instead of like some of the others where it takes VEarn points to reach vc etc...Also, lnstaII \'TOYOCASH\' App Enterr (TRDG) very reliable in paying you when you redeem to toyocash. You can choose assorted giftcards as payment or transfer to Walet for cash. Your choice. I love these guys thanks for addingsome fun to my day.',
       'Overall,  this is a great game. Two requests.  1) Selling multiple items at once.  I bought a load of junk and I need to sell it!  2) Make the schools "playable",  like the police station. I was talking to my sister about this and it\'d be cool if the schools were playable and you could build clubs inside it. Anyway,  I loved everything in the game! So fun,  so creative.',
       'First, I don\'t like that the game is in realtime it makes it a lot less fun and more boring. Secondly, I don\'t like that you HAVE to buy things just to get vip. I know that the prices are quite low but if you\'re just a kid like me then that limits what you can do. Lastly, I want more jobs and maybe even school to be playable it would just seem reasonable and make the game more addicting. Overall the game is really enjoyable but could do better, still keep up the good work!',
       'Love it addictive,if u like the sims on the pc you will like this.If you are a patient person you don\'t need to spend money either. Update it has lost stars as I don\'t want to spend money and now you need vip to get to the next stages of things. Disappointed with this. If you didn\'t have to pay for anything it would be 5 stars.',
       'im not sure what\'s the cause of the problem but what i know is the sims\' act a lil bit freaky. i just redownloaded this game bcs i cant log in this game before bcs i just updated it. before this, the sims is ok, but now they act really awkward. when they\'re walking, they legs dont even move! it\'s like they\'re flying, plus when they\'re doing any action like "clean the dishes", they dont move, they just stand still in front of the sink. this is freaky. please reply to my review bcs i really want to know more about this. i really like this game except what i said above. this game is really addicting:).',

The new room system that brings makes some level design unique. Some variety in levels and pigs. A new bird introduced: Silver The fortune tower   Cons: The lives system. Doesn\'t have that much of a story. Silvers ability is kinda disapointing.',
       'Great game, but honestly they need to tweak the chests for in app purchases. Why are the things not all even? I should be able to get the same level of item. If I spend 80 jewels, all the items should be equivalent. There should 3,500 feathers on the same page as 7,500 feathers. If I\'m level 300, even the common chests could reflect that. People will spend the money. Why not offer all the daily specials all the time? It\'s fun, but I spend cash money on this game, let\'s make it worthwhile...' ,

      'I like playing this game although i find that male characters do not have many long hair/ girl hair options available to buy unless you are vip or have diamonds. I think i speak for many people when i say that boys and girls should have more hair options from the opposite sex, for starcoins, as some people may take offense if they are strictly only allowed "boys hair"/ "girls hair" unlsss they are paying for it. I think you could inmprove further by making it easier to earn starcoins and another way to earn diamonds because many people do not want to/ cannot afford to BUY items in a fictional world.. Overall, i think this is a well rounded game, with a few improvement points, however i enjoy being able to have my own unique style in a virtual world :)',

       'Love these types of games, REALLY like the graphics to go with it. Only issue I\'ve had so far is, despite only just starting the game a little while ago there\'s no ads available for boosts?  Regardless, highly recommend if you like games like these.',

Additional to that i saw therr locked 200 diamonds i clicked one of that and all my 420 diamonds gone and onlu 220 diamonds left and its showing me 2 big circle white and pink.. that\'s not fair....',
       'Found a game called "Infinite Balls" on my friend\'s iPhone, we loved it. This is the best Android alternative we could find, but it\'s not quite as satisfying. Balls are never randomized, there are no circular objects for the balls to bounce off from and neither an infinite mode. Also you  have to get used to the controls. Would be nice to turn off the help lines, too.',

      'Graphics are awesome, but the game itself is very monotonous. You can fall asleep waiting for something to change and make it more exciting. When a change such as an added bonus does come (bomb or a rainbow bubble) you realize that it wasn\'t worth the 20 or 30 levels you just wasted your time on. Progressive enticing events need to happen more quickly.',
       'On level 19 I scored three stars bit it shows only two. Aside from that, no other complaints... YET. I will say thank you, though, for not aggressively pushing ads, pushing to pay to extend the aim line. So far, its amusingüòÅ',
       'I like that you don\'t have to pay for the Assistance or no stuff on the game to help you advance like the Hammers the ball that matches any color different stuff like that you just got to watch the ads which is fine with me at least it doesn\'t cost you a fortune to play I like the color on the graphics are very bright and colorful and good for children to play no violent content to it whatsoever great game for everyone across the board',
       'Excellent game, 20 on 10, but only worth 1 on 100 for WAY TOO MUCH USELESS ADVERTS!!! Not worth installing because of WAY TOO MUCH USELESS ADVERTS.',
       'This is a really fun game but my  my concerns are that when I have no balls left, for me it doesn\'t have the option to play a video to earn more but for my brother it does therefore it makes me start all over again. The other concern is that when I use a bomb for the chest it takes away a ball for example I have 12 balls when I use the bomb from the chest, I get 11 balls left which it doesn\'t do that for my brother. I hope you can fix this.',
       'Love it!!! I love how it doesn\'t get that more challenging. I\'m currently on level 75 and it\'s still not that difficult. I wanted something to just enjoy and not get worked up over by added tools/suspense/goals.' ,

       'It\'s honestly a fun game, and I\'d love to use it as a stimulating activity (ah, who am I kidding, it\'s just a great time killer), but it makes my head hurt-- and that\'s a problem. I\'m not even the type of person that is negatively affected by fast-paced graphics or rapidly changing colors. It\'d be five stars if it didn\'t give me headaches, but, for now, it gets three; good graphics, smooth gameplay, but no matter how great the app, it isn\'t worth physical discomfort. (Note: if you are looking for something similar, try "Run". It has the same sort of concept, but without the advertisements and headaches.)',
       'Ugh look people if u start playing this game oh wait if u had any sense u wouldn\'t. these adds are outrageous every time I die there an add I\'m not even kidding. My dad rates tones of games and I\'m the one playing some of them and I told my dad that these adds are so horrible I even had to report it. Now here me out great game but the adds. And in the beginning there is no instructions on how to do the game so like I said in the beginning there is a add at the end of every round so in the beginning there are many adds. Now i think there are more adds then game in this game. I\'m not trying to be mean so don\'t go cryingüò¢ to ur boss.' ,

      'There are far too many ads in game that you have to deal with, and game limitations basically force you to purchase stuff in order to even approach something resembling actual progress. What makes things worse is that there really isn\'t much of an actual game to be played here, just spin once, wait for the ad, spin again, wait for an ad, repeat until you uninstall the game permanently. I\'d only recommend this game to someone looking for an actively painful experience.',
       'At the rate you get coins it would take youbabreally long time for you to redeem for five dollars, but the ads are not very intrusive, and the game works.  If I can get an extra 5. Bucks by the end of the month, I\'m happy.',
       'The ads weren\'t the problem (I know U gotta make money some how) but the game just crashed for my phone.  I\'m gonna update the review since it was a bit harsh to give it one star. It\'s probably just my phone playing up it\'s been pretty buggy lately üòÇ',
       'The amount of ads is truly ridiculous. And if you intend to actually make any money at all with this game you will have to play for probably over a year to make 1 dollar. don\'t waste your time',
       'I really like this game. It\'s a great time killer but can you please not have the double reward and x2 thing pop up all the time. It is really annoying',
       'Nice game it\'s nice to make a bit of money. But.. there are just to many ads. I do not have a nice and normal experience while using the app. If you can lower the ads it will be a good app. I uninstalled because the ads where way to annoying. Please lower the amount of ads. Thanks' ,

      'There are ads every time you load something new as a level loads, again right after that. which is mentioned in multiple reviews. The game crashes every few levels and the Levels are now designed to be use the power ups for which you will end up paying for more. The first one was such a great game and some of these are enjoyable,  if you have the patience to wait for them.',
       'Its very nice to play. But........there is a gate where they force to get 3 keys by either watching advertisments or asking facebook .   And the worst paet is that u can only watch ones a day which makes 3 daysssss.. Thats what i hate.',
       'The ads are ridiculous. It crashes after some levels. I loved wheres my water 1 because I purchased it. Wish that was an option with this one. I\'ll probably uninstall and look for something else',
       'Ok I beat it but it was to many ads so many that after every level it would go to the home screen but im just glad they finally make the next level free i remember a lot of complaints on that also i was like waiting at the end to do some type of celebration but i dont know if i should uninstall it or like is something suppose to happen',
       'Much like the first game, it\'s fun but the bombardment of ads and the inability to progress without either sitting through tons of them or buying keys is honestly is a disgusting slap on the face. I\'d honestly rather just buy the game outright.',
       'Omg because I can\'t save this app to ANYTHING I\'ve lost all my progress because my phone broke. And I\'ve spent alot of money on this. Why cant u ppl add google or adding facebook to save progress. What a waste. Fix it and I\'ll consider going back and spending more money to get ahead' ,

      'The PvP system is super broken. One game might be played with someone at close to your rank and next you might be playing a player with 20,000+ more trophies than you. And along with that the 2 players aren\'t even getting the same waves of enemies to start with so someone with 8 less rank ups than you can beat you by 35,000+ points. This has only happened to me like 15 times a day so please fix it cause game ain\'t worth playing if PvP is broken.',
       'Bland, generic microtransaction-laden mobile version of a good game type. Levels are short and provide very little challenge until the difficulty spikes. Upgrades demand grinding or spending money. It\'s just more of the same trash flooding the mobile market.',
       'Great graphics and controls. Really unbalanced on PvP. So won\'t be bothering with that aspect of the game. Prices on gems is a bit of a rip off. Don\'t get much gems for the $. Will be avoiding that aspect of the game as well. Overall a solid 3 stars. Is fun, but could be so much better!',
       'Just wondering where my season rewards are I ranked pretty high and it started over but haven\'t recieved anything.  Why is this?  UPDATE: STILL WAITING FOR MY PVP REWARDS FROM A WEEK AND A HALF AGO.  WHAT GIVES?  THIS GAME IS A RIP OFF.',
       'The game was cool up until you start getting stuck and can\'t level up so the only way to move up you have to spend money to buy coins and hearts. Unfortunately people need to chase money rather than make something cool',
       'I\'ve always enjoyed this type of game, but the upgrade costs are absolutely insane for anyone who doesn\'t feel like shelling out gross amounts of cash in microtransactions. The levels steadily become longer and more tedious, without ever becoming an actual challenge. Too many ads for too little payout.' ,

      'The car will control itself... If you hold left it will turn left for a period but will start to try and straighten up... To test is on lvl 1 first corner accelerate and turn left (any set of controls tried all) it will start turning right seems to be when the prospective changes. Looks like it would be good if it went where you tell it to. Might be due to latest patch so will try again if it get fixed',
       'I hope in the new update you can upgrade the engine and body kits as well. That would bring back the fast and the furious Season 7 track 6 nexts to be check it says three lap but you are basicly doing lap 2 twice and it says wrong way. Third lap starts when u finish three laps and doing 4th lap counts as 3rd lap. Needs to be looked at this is cheating  u guys are doing',
       'Fix the detection when you touch/hit in perfect drift mode. There\'s been hundreds of times where ive definately not hit and yet it ends. So Infuriating, love the game but that one detail could definitely be optimized better. The drift should not end unless you actually hit and it screws up your direction. 4/5',
       'Game is really good. Best drift game I\'ve ever played on the phone. But there are small bugs in the game such as season 7 second perfect drift track (should be Turin) the race is not 3 laps. Even though I finish 3 laps it didn\'t finish the race and it gives the "wrong way" warning Everytime I pass from start/finish line. I hope you can fix this.',
       'I love this game and so do all my mates. It dose have a few light glitches as most games do. I would love a night track of some kind in the future but other wise great game all together. Also out of all the drifting games this is the best one at of all of them.',
       'I love this game! The cars are some of my favorites. There\'s only a couple things I would like to hopefully see in this game. First, if you could upgrade the cars more and you didn\'t have to use the cards. Like us money to upgrade engine parts, buy body kits, etc. And there\'s some kind of a sound glitch. The sound stays on for just a few races and then all of a sudden it stops working but I can still play the game.' ,

      'I AM OBSESSED!!! This game is awesome, I love shooting things that deserve to be shot!!! The only problem is that you need to be a certain level to buy something and how there\'s only boots and helmets, and no chest plates or leggings, but when I first played it I was shocked to find 2 problems in an amazing app! 5 stars everything! Also, you should make huge, amazing looking, almost impossible bosses that will make me flip my table when I can\'t beat them! Keep making more awesome games!',
       'This game would be perfect if the controls were better. They are nonsense. Doesn\'t always shoot when I tap, jumping is crazy, and the game gives you multiple ways to control, but they are all garbage. Also would have appreciated a tutorial so I knew what I was doing',
       'I can\'t help but love a mobile game that doesn\'t constantly shove advertisements in your face. No silly energy system to make you wait to play, and while it has a real money store, it\'s tucked away in a corner where it belongs. Different control options and simple, accessible gameplay make this a hidden gem. 5 stars all the way. Kudos to the developer.',
       'Excellent game, can\'t wait for a new map. There isn\'t any tutorials but it\'s quite a simple and fun game, you will catch on quick just be patient. Hope to see new maps soon don\'t make it too easy on us high levels now : )',
       'I really like the game. But there\'s one thing that annoys me: when I don\'t play this game for a few hours and then I do another battle in dungeon, the game crashes after killing last monster in that battle.  I found out that if I switch on mobile data it works. So I wanted to asked why is that. EDIT: now all works just fine. 5 stars',
       'Lots of work to do on this game. It\'s very SOLID in gameplay and possibilites, but lacks a lot of content. Needs to gather gold while away from the game, as the grind is tremendous right now! There is no purpose in leveling up your mine past lvl 5 right now. It doesn\'t do anything. The game is very incomplete, but has a ton of potential.' ,

      'Bought all the babies when I first downloaded the app. Everything was working great. So when the most recent (3) babies were available for purchase I bought them, but now those babies don\'t work!.... I\'ll give five stars when you get them to work. In the meantime, I think I should get a refund on my money.',
       'Downloaded this game for my daughter and we never got to play because the game will not load. It gets stuck on the bottle screen and then has a black screen after that. She has Nabi tablet, so I will keep the app for now and just disable it. Please fix soon!!!',
       'My daughter loves this game and plays it all the time. I just bought her all of the last babies today for her to have them all and the bottle freezes and she can\'t play with her new babies. If someone could fix this for me or refund me that would be great. I just got 6 new babies and she can\'t use any of them which is ashame cause she loves this game.',
       'Bought the game early on, then after an update with new babies they mixed the new babies in.  So you are left with a child constantly wanting the new babies.  A horrible money grab.  Otherwise a fun game.  Shoyld not show the locked babies mixed in with purchased ones.',
       'Dang, I wish the purchases I made on 6 more babies for my daughter would just work! She loves the app, but gets frustrated that the whole app freezes when she clicks to play one of the other babies. Wouldn\'t recommend this app because of that... it\'s just stealing my money..',

      'Nice game with very good events but the drop rates to heroes of 5 star is too low i killed a lot of gems and scrols and hero orbs and my first 5 star i  dropped it at lvl 75. Okok now again event of summoning 100 scrolls and i continue still no 5 star hero only 4, just try and fix the drop rate. In the rest its a nice game.',
       'I purchased the spring festival card on top of all the money I\'ve already dumped into this game and the devs didn\'t give me my in game rewards. I\'ve submitted numerous tickets to get a refund or my rewards and they just reply there is no problem. Ya no problem with you taking my money.  They deleted my review, wonder how many other people had this issue and had reviews deleted.',
       'Wasn\'t sure about this game at first. I love it. I use a f2p  and a vip one  to see  the difference  between the two. Really well done. Having said all that the game does require patience. This is an IDLE game. You pick it up do dailies, talk, spend money, or what ever you want to do in game, then put it down to "farm gold,xp,mats". The high end heros do take some planning to aquire as a f2p player. This game requires patience because it\'s an IDLE game. Yes some people have a ton of money to throw at the game but don\'t be jealous, just play your game and have fun.',
       'Honestly gameplay and all is good but the game is so p2w it\'s not funny, it would cost u over a hundred dollars just to complete every reward for new Valentine\'s event. If you like this game play private server instead this version is a giant cash grab. Not competitive for f2p at all',
       'Nice graphics, intuitive control, fun. In the beginning, it was a little too much going on for my ADHD self, but now I\'ve been playing for a couple months and it\'s my favorite mobile game of all time. I love collecting all the interesting heroes as well as saving for events and seeing what RNGsus  will bring next!  My only complaint right now is that their notification system is whack. Especially in the beginning, it\'s easy to miss things you can do.',
       'Too much pay to win, free players hardly getting anywhere in the events and so fourth, not fair, increase the rewards of spending money and give free players more too easily solved, I previously rated it 5 stars instantly loved it but as I\'ve progressed it\'s just not fair!! Please do something!! I am vip6 but I\'m not rich, please bring more rewards for loyal free users who watch the ads and everything!! Thank you!!' ,

       'It was good but then this happened. I was playing just like any other day. My phone had died while I was playing, so I charged it and left it untouched for about an hour or two. When I signed in, all off my progress was erased! Please respond and tell me what happened.',

       'Irritating. At first it gives you an option of playing a video to receive additional help. Which works only for the first time. Next time onwards no way to cancel the video in case you don\'t want to install it. It is so frustrating. Either allows to cancel or tell the users what to do next. Worst way of promoting other apps.',
       'Why ask people to pay to have ads removed and still have so many features that you need to watch ads for? It just seems like a rip off to me very disappointed in this purchase',
       'I had to update it so I did and when I wanted to play after that, it says "watch video to get extra seed slot" WHICH I ALREADY PAID FOR WITH THE COINS I COLLECTED ALL THESE TIMES. Even before the update, it has so many ads but this is much worse. Definitely not happy with the update.' ,

       'Love the game but WAY to many ads. Not bad the first level. A 5 sec. ad every 2 or 3 boards. But by half way through the 2nd level it\'s a 30 sec. ad after every board. Definitely going to uninstall it. Too bad.',
       'Hated all the ads every game has an ad! Don\'t waste your time! Uninstalling because of ad bombardment.',

      'Hey RobTop, the game is ok, but there is one issue. im used to playing geometry dash with my samsung chromebook 3 (it doesn\'t have touchscreen) and when i press the spacebar on my computer (this is the same issue on geometry dash lite and subzero) it doesn\'t let me jump. And can you let geometry dash world players create and play user created levels. Fix and add this and I will give you 5 stars. Gameplay and graphics are nice.',
       'This game stress me out but the next day when I play it I beat the lv in one go and fills my heart up with joy! So what if the control\'s are sensitive? I know they are.. but if you take a day and give it another go you know what happens and you do great!',

IF U ALREADY DOWNLOAD SONGS AND LEVELS IN FEATURED THEN AFTER PLAYING YOUR SAVED LEVELS AND SONGS THEN IF U WANT TO EXIT GD WORLD AND IF U WANT TO PLAY GD WORLD AGAIN U WANT TO PLAY SOME SAVED LEVELS THEN IF U SEE SOME SAVED LEVELS THAT U DOWNLOAD U NEED TO DOWNLOAD IT AGAIN AND IT\'S SONGS THATS WHY I HATE GD WORLD EVEN GD FULL!! (F*** MY LIFE!!)',
       'I love this game just...can you fix one glitch? On the final level final area the wave is bugged ...when I tap it goes down by itself! Can you please fix it? I was trying over 3 hours to make it but I can\' t because of the glitch :( Please fix it.',
       'Got all the way to the end,  and an as popped up accidentally clicked on it cuz it was being slow,  and ended up having to restart all of the levels,  fix this,  it doesn\'t happen with the other geometry dash games,  just this one every time I exit my data gets deleted...  Fix then 5 stars' ,

      'This game is perfect for anyone who loves magic, fantasy, collecting, and a whole new level of adorable! Dragonvale takes everything to the next level! I highly recommend it, as it is a amazing game, my most played, and I hope everyone else enjoys it just as much as I do. Five stars! üåüüåüüåüüåüüåü Edit 2: I was re-organizing my islands by Element the other day, and I had just finished the Plant Island. I put down a Oversized Oak Tree, and immediately, a image flashed through my mind: a young girl, sitting on a branch of the oak tree, a book in one hand, a baby Plant dragon sitting next to her. Stretched out in front of them was my Plant Island, the dragons freely soaring, the other islands in the distance. And that sparked a inspiration in my head. I just wanted to ask; can I write a Dragonvale book, which takes place at my park? Please let me know !  :)',
       'Cmon Backflip! Okay look I love Dragonvale, I\'ve been playing it forever. First off I lost my amazing park a while back and that really sucked. But now I am restarting and I go to buy the beginners pack for 9.99 and it says there was an error and i wont be charged...come to find out it did charge me and i didnt receive anything! Please help',
       'I have been playing for a while. After events you get a day to turn in your event specific currency for the prizes, even though the event has ended. Well for Gardenia\'s event, it turned in all my roses before I could exchange them. I had over 25,000 and was so pumped to get the new dragons. Now I don\'t have any roses and 25,000,000 extra coins i don\'t need. Please help. This is a very frustrating bug.',

      'Great solitaire game! If you want to play on and on, you need to buy extra credits, which I did because I could not wait+their CS is amazing!! Games are fun to play and challenging... You could still play without buying credits,,, it would just be slower. Highly recommended,! So grateful for fantastic customer service',
       'I really like the concept of this game. Unfortunately I am not prepared to even give it one star as it doesn\'t take you long to realize that the only aim from this game is to extract money from all who wish to play. Pitiful really as there are many similar games available which you don\'t have to feel pressure to buy',
       'The game is very fun, but I only get to play one or two hands before I have to wait another hour to get more credits to play. Would be a lot better if you got more credits for wins or had free play. I\'m not spending money to buy credits. Also, it would be great if there was an option to turn off the fancy card movements; I get motion sick from it.',
       'If you like solitaire you will hate this game. This isnt a game of skill or strategy. Its a sort of a matching game and it becomes clear quick that they are going to drain you of your seed currency quick so you can start spending real money. You will just pull card after card that you dont need.',
       'Its great game love that I don\'t need Wi-Fi to play it. But some of levels just get so impossible to beat you spend four day on one level. Make the crops pay out more and levels make them a bit easier make the challenges be the hard ones.',
       'Great game concept, great graphics, however it really sucks that the amount of coins required to play  increases too much and you don\'t get enough coins. I wish it didn\'t cost so much to play, it seems like they just want you to actually buy more coins. No thanks. Will be deleting.' ,

      'A great time killer with well-written, diverse, and addicting stories. I\'m far from the first one to say this, but my one critique is how often diamonds are needed to make choices that are interesting/clearly crucial to the plot. I don\'t mind paying for diamonds or playing chapters of other stories to save up, but 20 diamonds should last longer than just one chapter. I suggest either introducing a subscription based option that frees up all choices for a one time or monthly fee or reducing the amount of diamonds needed to make a special choice. An alternative way of earning diamonds, such as watching ads, might be something to consider as well.',
       'Great game but the only downside to it is, some choices need more diamonds to make it all interesting whilst you only earn 1 dimond per chapter which basically leaves you with no choice left other than reluctantly pick the one that is free.  If there could be more diamonds to earn ,without spending real money to purchase game ones, it would receive higher rankings of course.',
       'The stories are great but to enjoy them properly, you have to spend diamonds. Free diamonds at the beginning is way too less (25 diamonds). And you earn 1 diamond per chapter, which is less because to make premium choices you have to spend so much more diamonds (min. 12 diamonds for a choice). And you have to make at least one premium choice per chapter. Buying the diamonds is way too expensive. I think the developers should allow users to earn more diamonds in the game. Maybe make them watch a video to earn free diamonds. That would certainly help...',
       'Really fun but I wish you gave us more than 2 keys. I\'m not going to spend actual money on a short story but I\'m sure a lot of others will, which is great for you but I think 2 keys is a little low since there are numerous chapters to play and many stories to choose from. Would be cool if you would match most other games and give us 5 keys for gameplay.',
       'Love the story lines, the graphics, all of it. Would have liked to seen something that can be done to regenerate the diamonds or do something to earn more diamonds other than finishing a new chapter earns you only one. Did experience my diamonds disappearing and the timer of keys along with the keys reach zero and not returning. Hope this issue will be resolved. Other than these issues really enjoyed the game, it\'s highly addictive.',
       'I\'ve been playing this game for a few days, so here\'s my review. I enjoy the stories even though they use a lot of archetypes, and I don\'t mind waiting for keys. The biggest issue I have is with the gems and premium choices: not only do the premium choices cost an unreasonably high amount of gems, but every time there are choice options with at least one premium choice, the premium choices are always presented as the better ones. This is less like making my own choices and more like reaffirming my assumption that the premium choices are always the better ones. I\'ve come to the conclusion that I would rather pay once to have this app installed rather than install it for free and pay money for gems just so I could pick the premium choices.' ,

      'I Would Give It Five Stars...but...you should make it customizable for the colors you want to cycle through as you stack higher. THIS GAME IS NOT COLOR BLIND FRIENDLY. Great Idea Though, Nice Hand Eye Coordination Exercise. (I see Black and White, so a monochrome setting would be nice. Other people see colors differently as well) Needs A Color Cycle Customizer, or a set of different options for each type of Color Blind. Thanks in advance',
       'I LOVE THIS GAME This is good game design. It rewards you no matter how high you go with a beautiful little tower. The colors are really satisfying. It keeps me engaged since you can "regrow" your blocks. That creates tension too--something to strive for. It\'s so simple but soothing and really addictive!!',
       'A Great Game For When You\'re Dumpin\'. I decided to install it because I ran out of YouTube videos while droppin\' a duce. I really enjoy and will be using it the next time I\'m in here as well. The ads are there, but they aren\'t too bad and there is an option to remove them for a small fee as well (which I plan to do.) My time in the bathroom has flew by because of the game and I\'m happy to say that. I don\'t like to stay too long. Great game!',
       'So,  basically it\'s a pretty fun app to play when you\'re bored. It\'s a great time killer, and is very challenging, but at the same time easy! It\'s a perfect app! I remember I downloaded this, and then I uninstalled it because I needed other apps on my phone. And now I installed it again, so then I have a fun game to play. I don\'t really have any games on my phone, so this is the perfect one. The inventors are genius! Five stars!!',
       'Challenging and aesthetically pleasing A well made, minimalist stacking game which takes a long time to master, with nice simple visuals, a satisfying game mechanic and good sound effects. The instant replayability makes for a good competitive game amongst friends. The only reason it doesn\'t have a 5* is because I feel more could have been added to it, and done with the mechanic.',
       'Good, with a major flaw I\'ve ran into an issue that occurs about 1 out of every 3 rounds, where I\'ll tap, and the game won\'t register the trap until well after the position I wanted. For a game based on timing and your ability to stack moving blocks, when you tap is important, and needs to be 100% reliable. I\'m on a Nexus 6P, very new phone with excellent hardware. I\'ve closed all background apps, to try and troubleshoot. It\'s an issue I\'d like to see fixed.' ,

      'I really hoped that this would be different than Episode, Choices, or Chapters, but nope. This is even worse. The fact that the game doesn\'t even give you any diamonds to start off is bad, but it\'s ridiculous to not even be able to choose the special choices because they require a lot of diamonds... So disappointing. Solmare, for the love of god, please be unique! Give the readers more tickets and diamonds and give us the ability to earn tickets/diamonds through watching videos! Seriously! Don\'t download unless you want to go through a circle of pain.',
       'Why does untold darkness book 1 and 2 not follow eachother.... Its not book 2 if my choices from book 1 don\'t carry over and the relationships are completely different. Other than that I like it so far. Like the earn diamonds too',
       'I really like the game and would have give 5 stars if darkness untold 2 would have been the following of darkness untold 1.... It\'s like the 1,you start from the beginning... But with another with the story taking another way... Very disappointing',
       'So sorry if I don\'t like it but it doesn\'t depict reality there are. Many skin tones in the world but you choose to put two skin tones on here and to be perfectly honest I bet I could make a better game that depicts real life',
       'My problem is why is the black characters so ugly... I mean the other characters are just decent but the dark skinned black character looks lik trash and I get mad because the other ones don\'t...',
       'So far it has been interesting. As far as these games go, at least they have challenges that allow you to win some diamonds unlike choices, what\'s your story and episodes ( with chapters you can watch videos, but that only gives you one diamond, so this is still better ). The characters faces are a bit odd though, but there is a similar problem with  episodes and choose your story. I am so drawn in by the mystery and fantasy stories so much that I hardly even notice the faces now. Also I love the aggressive lover options, for me fantasy means getting to do stuff I can\'t do in real life, like aggressively pursuing my love interests' ,

      'Pretty good design, but there is a cheater mode which tells you when one is wrong even if it\'s not apparent. So the fastest times are always really fast even for the hard ones. Also the ad bar is right below the numbers so you accidentally hit it when you play. Pretty sure that\'s intentional to get extra clicks, but super annoying.',
       'having lots of fun with the game, especially the daily challenges. But  ads that cannot be skipped pops up way too often, and its quite irritating. Also it would b good if u can ad d something like automatically mark (diff cotour, shade out) the numbers thats already been fully filled so we dont have to check it manually.',
       'Great game for keeping your mind active and gives me something to do on my phone.  If there was a way to get rid of the adds then it would be even better.  I wouldn\'t expect a free game to be advert free; but I would like a feature to remove them even if I have to pay.',
       'The game in itself isn\'t bad but I\'ve completed a puzzle in 10 minutes and for the past half an hour I don\'t know what to do next, does it pop up on the screen \'You have finished\' or do we just move on? I\'ve been looking for any place that I\'ve gone wrong but I haven\'t found any',
       'My wife and I play this game like an old couple as we wait for our son to sleep, sure enough - we all doze off!  This game makes the brain go, sometimes my brain goes so hard that smoke comes out my ears.  Beautiful. Thank you for the gift of this game, we\'ve shared about the light it brings into our lives.   That\'s a good ending.',
       'Really functional sudoku app with a great UI and some nice features. My one issue is the hint button.  I tap it way too often by accident and it permanently reveals a tile, which kind of spoils the puzzle. Otherwise it\'s great' ,

      'I love playing the game but there are so many updates all the time. And when they do their bimonthly update you have to download new package and then some gameplay features dont work. I have had a couple things not work from last update. I tried to contact support and they havent replied at all. Its been three days now. Im an everyday player who spends real money in game. Would rate higher if someone would help me out..',
       'I recently switched to mobile gaming only, and I have a g stylo phone and a Nvidia shield k1 tablet. On my phone I get network error (I\'m data only) and my tablet says the game isn\'t compatible. It\'s marshmallow OS on the shield tablet and the thing can run borderlands 2 natively so I know it\'s not a hardware issue. This game looks cool. Wish I could find out for sure. And no, I\'m not running a speed test.',
       'Will i ever get the chance to play again? Cant sign in to complain and it doesn\'t look like LOD  really  care about the players. I haven\'t been able to get on since The 8th!!! The game has stoped loading after the last update. It will either reach 21% or 71%.',
       'I am level 83 and i love this game. But plunder dont work soul vortex also dont work and more players are experiencing same thing. I send support ticket 10 days ago no one answer. If u fix these bugs il give 5 stars',
       'The features of the game are cool.. i like all the pvp dungeons.. but most of the dungeons with event goes in certain time and limited.. if i miss them..then i hardly get the purpose of installing this game meaning.. nothing else to do.. it\'s getting boring for player like me who wants to spend hours online but no more rewarding pvp dungeons available overnight.. maybe create some entertaining 24 hours pvp features? I can tell many players tend to be inactive for more than 1 day...so hope for more crowded and better LOD..',
       'I just realized this evening that this game uses the microphone feature to spy on the players and listen to their conversations without their consent. After joining one event I could clearly hear conversations of other players (not about game and I\'m sure without them even knowing that they were being listened to) while I was having my sound turned off, even after leaving that particular event and when having my game in the background the sounds didn\'t stop until I turned off the game. This game should be called Legacy of Spies, nice try üëçüèª' ,

Also, after I play each round therr is a ad and I wish I could just play not play waut gor 2 ads play ad play ad ad ad ad.

       'This game is really good and fun but strate after you lose all 3 of your lives it goes straight onto an add. There are loads of adds and I don\'t think it needs that much adds for a game like dumb ways to die, on the other hand it\'s a grate game and it\'s a laugh and a joke, I think it\'s a really good game‚ò∫',
       'I think that there could be less ads. When I\'m trying to replay he game an ad pops up which is really annoying. What I would say is that this is an excellent game but just less of the ads',
       'A truly wonderful and entertaining game. Very well supported with great updates over the years. Latest version (Valentine\'s) appears to be buggy (animations jerk ahead) ruining the gameplay. I\'m unsure it this is the game or my phone.',
       'Love it although can get annoying This game is really fun and I remember the oldest version and now it has more dumb ways to die which is amazing! Although some of the mini games are annoying no matter what I do I still die from them. Other than that, it\'s an amazing interactive game :)' ,

      'This is a great game and is challenging it definitely requires some focus and concentration. There is a bug that needs to be fixed it is on the gold game mode and it\'s the game that asks you to select which colours are more prominent out of all the squares but the coloured squares don\'t appear. Please fix this as soon as possible because I really enjoy this game.',
       'I really lived thus game because it isn\'t just tapping something but it\'s actually training your brand and improving your attention, memory, logic and your mind in general. If you need help in any of those subjects (or you just like a bit of fun ) I would dwfinately say this is the game for you.',
       'Very great game, I can pic some logic questions here and ask it on my friends ang classmates. It really gives me a brain exercise. Wheneve I feel bored, this game takes my bored away',
       'Simple but fun. These games are challenging and do make you use your brain without taking much time. You can play a few levels in just a few minutes easily. Ads are not too bad either, not too obtrusive and are sporadic enough.',
       'the memory mahjong doesn\'t work for me. even after I updated the app, the mahjong pieces do not flip when I\'m supposed to memorize them, they just disappear. and I don\'t want to reinstall the game, bc I don\'t want to lose my progress. I wish you could somehow fix it. thanks',
       'Fast game play,  you can train for a few minutes, or as hour, depending on what you have time for.  Auto saves your progress. Ads are not intrusive,  and can be skipped easily. The games do get a bit repetitive.' ,

      'I like this game, I really do. It is intense and fun, but the ads are a little too intrusive, if I connect to a game and the players disconnects before the map starts - you get an ad. I do understand that the game is free and all and I want the game to have ads to support the game, but this game has the most ads of any other game I know, so please atleast have a limit to the ads shown a day or have it shown every 2 games. Also I think it would be cool to have an option to watch a couple of ads to get a club ticket or have it to speed up the 24 hour cool down on the club arenas. Overall this game is really fun and I hope Ninja Kiwi keeps improving it.',
       'The only thing I do not like is how you need the vip membership to use the special modes, which I get you guys need money to keep it going but I think like one day a week there it should he free for that day or and hour or two. Keep up the good work Ninja Kiwi üòä',
       'The ads are ever increasing, I don\'t pay for games and being forced more and more is a deterrent to continue playing. Turn it down a notch.... edit to developer reply...that doesn\'t explain why more and more ads are popping up. What was wrong with it before?  Getting greedy with get you nowhere.',
       'It\'s a fun game, great for passing the time. That being said it suffers some very problematic connection issues, if I tab away for even half a second it disconnects me and causes and auto loss',
       'I thought it was a really good game and very addictive. I wish that instead of you losing when you\'re connection is down the game should carry on until you join again. I\'ve lost loads of battle\'s that where going really well then lose connection and it won\'t reconnect so I get a loss. Also there are loads of ads.',
       'Ranking system is horrible,  to many game options make matching a hassle.  Defence mode is to hard to play even though its made to be like single player, very discouraging.  Then when you get into it the game it crashes.  This happens frequently, very upsetting I don\'t know how this game has a 4.4 star rating.  It also throws ads at you randomly as well as has pay to win with  the ability to buy metals.  One or the other please.  Not made for the player at all.' ,

      'I like the game. Nice little time-waster. But *please note* that just before the Barracuda/Moon/ability-cards update I was rolling in in-game cash, had upgraded everything physical and had just started to buy the different paintjobs. Then the game reset me to zero earnings/kills/vehicles/upgrades. So it took time to get back up to speed and get everything (except painting) upgraded. Which I did. And was swimming in cash again, with nothing but visuals to spend it on. Bought a couple of those and then gpt Zeroed again! Was going to blame it on the paints, next time I checked in online. Maybe a subtle bug? Except now I find an upgrade, with something else to spend my (lost) game-coins on. Hope it\'s not /that/!  So, anyway, rather than remove and move on, I *will* grind up again. I\'ll get everything, along the way. *Except* the paints. And then see if it zeroes again before the next update, anyway. FYI, both developers and potential players. It\'s entertainment enough that I\'ll put myself through this, but note the mild frustration of the situation. ADDENDUM: Strangest thing - opening after update (but offline again, never yet opened whilst online) I seem to have regained about *half* the updates I thought I had lost, with coin level about where I might expect mid-grind. Also, you\'ve rescaled. Things look smaller, except that level-chooser now has two level-\'icons\' on this (wide) screen rather than three. Usually the left one is the active one (as confirmed by background layers, which goes through odd but maybe intentional \'assemble into position\' effect upon side-scroll selection of a new one). FYI.',

      'A great game, but WAAAAY  too many ads. Its the same thing after each level: AN AD. The game is fun, but its hard to enjoy when you\'re watching ads every second. And Im getting the same ads over and over! I want to rate five stars, I really do, but I cant if there\'s going to be this many ads in a game I think everyone would enjoy. üíõüíõüíõüíõ‚ô° (( pretend the hearts are stars )) I\'ll download the game again once I see less ads in your games, like My Talking Angela, which also has way too many ads. Please take this into consideration! Thank you!',
       'The game was great until they put the ads on there, there are too many and 90% of the time I try to "x" out of one, it takes me to the play store anyway, and the game freezes a lot more now. It\'s also frustrating you can\'t alter the decorations. Game needs some improvements, and I hope they address them because it\'s quite fun to play.',
       'I am so disappointed in this game due to the fact my 3 year old somehow bypassed my password and spent 79.99 on coins!!! I sent a message immediately to Google play and the developer and I was told it doesn\'t meet the refund requirements. WTH?!! So frustrating! üò°',
       'This game would be a whole lot of fun IF there weren\'t so many ads! My niece is not patient enough to wait for stupid ads to finish, and u can\'t play the game until the ad is finished! Very disappointed!',
       'Love this game. Super fun but how do you get rid of ads? I paid for coins yet i still have ads. This is highly annoying especially if i can\'t skip them. Still love the game just not the ads :(',
       'I hate this game cause one, you can\'t even change the decorations or visitors. Two, you can\'t even get coins for completing a level and the daily wheel is rigged cause you can\'t get anything good. Three, if you watch a video for a reward or life, it never gives you anything. And four, they don\'t give you enough moves for each level, there are too many ads and everything\'s so overpriced. Hate this bullcrap gameüò°' ,

      'Would be nice if there was a redo button for the last move. I\'m very quick when playing and I often misplace a block. Also, why does the Apple version have stars and the android version doesn\'t? I was trying so hard to earn enough stars to buy the colour packs on my iPod, and I got quite disappointed that I can\'t do that on android. I guess I\'ll just delete the game off android since there\'s really no goal to the game now.',
       'Very fun and addicting but nice calm relaxing game. Ads only happen after each round and not a big deal. If you want to keep playing this game FREE then add up with the package. Quiet whinning about ads. Someonbe has to pay the creators for this game including the upkeep and updates. How else will the creator make his money? 2 choices, either gets ads or charge to download. So I can deal with the ads. It\'s a FREE APP.',
       'Just downloaded this today and got hooked. Idk what exactly I got hooked on in because it\'s a fairly \'simple\' game, but I\'m pretty proud of my highscore of just over 5K. I wanna type more, but playing this game for an entire hour long bus ride has my energy drained. Y\'all have a pretty good game system hereüëç:)',
       'Kind of fun just trying to beat 1010. Played 5 times maybe and more than doubled the score that it says 1% get to..... not very fun after beating it. After the targets destroyed, what else do you aim for?',
       'Way too many ads. I just need something for my fingers to do while listening to podcasts but this constantly interrupts my listening pretty much after every round. I really liked the game but I have had it with thw ads and am uninstalling. It\'s just not worth it.',
       'I really like the game but as many others have said their are too many ads. Ads after every round and sometimes in the middle of the round which makes you start over and that gets annoying. Too many of thr same ads. I also agree their needs to be a redo button. It does get a bit pintle after you hit the goal but still fun.' ,

      'Really liked this when I first started playing. Honestly,there is no point me keeping it now. Can\'t perform my operations,as don\'t have bought staff and ward not on the appropriate level. I can\'t get any new staff,as I don\'t have enough hearts,and once you are at a standstill like this it take FOREVER to earn hearts back. Have loads of cash but nothing to do with it!! Game seems to be designed around getting people hooked initially (as performing operations etc is really fun), but then can\'t continue or progress without purchasing hearts!! Not wasting my time with it any longer.',
       'Your new update will not let me, or several people it looks like,  get into the game. I am currently doing the 12 day event and am on level 17 please fix it ASAP! I refuse to lose all my progress. This is the best game I\'ve had on my phone in a very long time.',
       'I\'m VERY unhappy!! I downloaded the update and the game informed me there was a problem with the download. I then uninstalled and reinstalled the game and ALL my progress was lost. Its back to the beginning. Worst part is I just spent 10 bucks on content...money down the drain. Lesson learned. It\'s a very good game but DON\'T spend money on purchases.',
       'I downloaded the game, it\'s a great game except for today when I did an update and now won\'t let me get back into the game. Also, really difficult to level up after level 7. Everything is really expensive. Not so much fun when you have to wait along time for money to accumulate. Might delete the game.',
       'Enjoyed it for the first two days, but it just feels boring now, the game is very very slow, and there is nothing new in it, similar type of surgery every time, and in most of the cases only we have to stitch the wound. Also the upgrade time for everything is too high, have to wait for nothing.  Read some reviews before in which the developer had asked to wait till the next update, i did so, and today i updated the game, and surprisingly, nothhing changed. Wasted my 203MB of data. Finally uninstalled it. Anyways thanks for the two days fun.',
       'This last update screwed it up so i cant get it to let me play it just sayd issue loading game and to come back later. I uninstalled and wont be re installing becouse im not doing all that hard work all over agian.' ,

ToyoCash is a legit app that allows to earning point just by doing some simple tasks (like instaling, watch advertisements and so on). Then you can exchange your points for Digital Giftz Cardz,PayPal,Paytn and there\'re various options to choose from. ToyoCash is perfect for anyone in anywhere, who has free time but doesn\'t want to waste it, you can use this app while working, studying.. simply earning points by watching advertisements!!!',
       'Used to be my favorite game.  The latest update completely changed the character of the game.  The ball is faster, bouncier, and everything is smaller, and it all adds to just randomness.  The AI got worse at the same time, so it\'s not really harder... just more random.  I now find that this game stresses me out instead of helping me relax, so I have to give it up.',
       'Stale gameplay with nothing interesting. AI sucks. Lv 27 has little difference from lv 1. Too boring. Time to rid this trash from my phone at least I bothered playing with AI till lv 27. I wonder if there is even a end game or maybe the level keeps increasing aimlessly without any interesting change. Bored to max.',

      'Hi Development Team, I believe there is a bug with this game. That is all the waiters after a while they would just idle and stand still even when customers   are waiting them. So I would like to give it 1* for the gameplay. Please fix it soon.',
       'When is the next update on the game and how much longer do we have to wait for Bill and Mary to say I do ? It\'s killing me to wait this long ? Oh I am also wondering why haven\'t I got to go on a higher level I have been on level 28 for the longest time so fix the problems now',
       'Great game. Enjoy the different story lines. What happened to the wedding storyline for Bill & Mary? Every time Diego leaves something goes wrong. My township has disappeared.  I had deposited money & spices in the treasury...what\'s joining on.',
       'I loved this game but when I\'ve played a while  it tells me my profile has changed and to reload losing any progress since the last time I loaded the game very annoying as progressing is taking even longer',
       'After the most recent update 20 feb 2018, the game keep closing.it take long time to liad and then close after few seconds please fix it soon.i dont want to miss festival.',
       'DOWNLOAD THIS! YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT! IT IS AWESOME! lovely way to pass time, cute stories. Love making combos.(very thoughtful of the developers). One of the best games i have played in a while! 5 STARS ALL THE WAY!' ,

      'This game is AMAZING! With that said, heres the problem. Stop with the obnoxious freaking monkey!!!! Im sick of him popping up every 30 secs with no skip button. Ill be getting up a good tapping speed and it will jist ruin it by popping up with no option to click off. If i want to explore the game further, i will, at my own pace. I dont need you to hold my hand. Its really spammy and ruining the game play. Tutorial based gaming is a waste and a headache. Also its laggy. Please fix this. I LOVE this game and i want to play but the spammy monkey is a deal breaker.  Rant over',
       'I like the game very much. I bought the starter pack for a dollar 99 and removed ads. After the update came out, the one that and the ability to watch a video to double your rewards, your offline rewards, I click to watch the video and then the game sends me to the store to buy a gem pack. I click off of that and then it says the video is not available. I assume it wants me to buy another gem pack in order to enable that feature. I will not be doing that as that is ridiculous. I already bought the starter pack. Please fix this as the game is very fun and addictive.',
       'One of the most obnoxiously money grabbing games i played. Commercials popping out constantly, and the rewards for watching them are more often than not just worthless. It\'s a shame because the game is quite fun to play otherwise',
       'It was fun, but im slowly starting to hate it. One moment youre just looking at youre businesses and the next they are shoving ads down your throat. I shouldnt have to look at ads unless i get something in return.',
       'The tutorial will not let me play the game, it continues to interrupt me and forces me to do what it wants. Graphics are also cheap and ugly looking. It also feels janky, and buggy to control. I wish I could enjoy this otherwise decent idle game.',
       'Game is great. There an ad that keeps popping up for "Coin Masters" that wants nothing to do with closing. So I gotta force stop my game. Other than that great game' ,

      'Favourite Shark game in the entire world. I became obsessed because it\'s so addictive and fun. The graphics are amazing, disappointed when I got my new phone I lost my progress even when I used the smart transfer to transfer the app. I\'ve had to start all over again... but the fun continues!',
       'This game is really addictive and i love it but i own everything now so I don\'t play anymore. I occasionally get on just to check for new stuff and they do put out new stuff but it takes a long, loooonggggg time. Please put new sharks out and don\'t make us wait foreverrrr!',
       'It\'s a fun game and I\'m enjoying it. However, I\'ve come from Hungary Shark Evolution and find that the tilt controls in World are vastly inferior to Evolution. Is there a way they can be made more effective? As it stands, I actually have to bend over just to get my shark to swim to the surface. Not fun at all.',
       'Fun time waster, can get quite a lot sunk into it, and get e erything without paying up. Glad its always been grindable. Just has had trouble connecting for saves. I lost everything a couple years ago before they had cloud saves... They\'re here now and aside from a logout/in they are wonderous afaik. Good stuff!',
       'Everything is lagging. From exploring the sea to chomping down the humans and fishes. It was great before but it is getting very very lagging. For example, Swimming towards a school of fish but instead of eating them, shark just swam through them. All sharks are lagging. Glitching here and there. Please fix this!',
       'I\'ve had to start this game all over from the very beginning 3 times. After working hard to get all the way to the top sharks, the app will suddenly refuse to connect to your Facebook account and want you to start a whole new game. Waste of time. Very frustrating. Not enjoyable at all. Find a game that\'s enjoyable. This one is definitely not fun.' ,

      'I love Beat the Boss 4! But there are some things that I would like to be fixed. For example, when naming your custom boss, the name duplicates. The way to fix it is by putting spaces after it. Another example is that the boss customization screen sometimes switches back to boss selection screen and can\'t go back after being there for long periods of time. I would love to give this game 5 stars if these issues were fixed.',
       'I loved it. I understand the ads are so that you can continue your work. However, there is a few probelms. First of all, when you click on the judgey/uneven eyes, they change to even eyes. Second of all, when you click on a custom character, the game doubles the name, and following along with that, sometimes it undoes it. I understand if it takes a long time, but i\'m asking you, if you can, to please fix these when you can. Sorry for bothering you.      Doge is waiting',
       'I\'d happily purchase this game but that doesn\'t seem like an option. Tge ads, especially the LOUD BLOW UP EXPLOSIONS game that go on for 30 seconds are especially annoying. I\'ll gladly buy it, if only to not deal with Fing ads all the Fing time!!',
       'Too many ads. It\'s annoying especially when you are connected to the internet. The King Boss is not working and is always saying "Something went wrong, please try again later" and crashes the whole gane. On the other hand it\'s a super addictive and fun game to play.',
       'Game is now unplayable due to ads and KIIP rewards popups. The ads bring up my status bar so I can\'t X out of the ad, and the app hangs when trying to load the KIIP program. I have no interest in trying to play something that shovels ads in your face more often than you can actually play.',
       'Recent updates have made this guy unplayable. Now you have to wait  through a 24 second ad that keeps reoccurring.  Not fun for kids and worse for their parents. Kids loved it before these updates.' ,

      'Awsome game. Completed all levels without any hack jzt waited  for hope   ( the lives ) evrbdy shld try this. Sry i gonna uninstall this app only bcoz i finished all levels. Each time when u invite me to rate this app i was thinking that i shall rate this 5 if i win the 75th level. Now iam satisfied.... Great timepass.. Nice tactics, waiting 4 more awsome funny levels. If anybody has any diffrnt opinion cntact me on telegram @chichu  this is my user name. Thnx 4 thiz awsome gift babe.',
       'The game is really interesting and entertaining. The graphics are smooth and and the controls are manageable.   The thing I disliked through my game play is that you don\'t get any clues what you have to do and/or how to defeat the new "enemies". While you understand what exactly you have to do, you\'ve lost some lives. But that\'s not so important.  I will strongly recommend this game just because of its graphics, entertainment and due the fact, that this game is not pay-to-win game.',
       'I really liked this game. The levels are very challenging and this game is addictive and fun. The only issue is that there are only 5 short lives  that when our lives ran out, we have to wait 18-19 minutes long to have 5 lives again. Of course, there are many hard levels in the game that keeps us dying and think a way to pass the level. So if possible, please shorten the time, like 5-7 minutes only and let us really enjoy the game. It\'s more even challenging and thrilling if there are many lives. And this game will be really perfect for us. Thank you.',
       'Completed all but just couldn\'t get enough of it. Everyone should play Redball 4. It is D best android games I\'ve ever played. Those who complained about the Game play and control has an abnormal thumb. Easy, Fun & Challenging but nothing impossible to get through. I just hope they make new levels.',
       'I love this game üòçüòç it is my favourite but.... I don\'t like The lives system . I have to wait for it . I know that there is a pro version but.. can you please give us one or 2 extra lives when we complete a level? I think it\'s a great ideaüòãüòã btw i loved it üòçüòçüòç ill give it 5 stars thenüòäüòä',
       'Game is great, but when you lose all your lives it takes some minutes for you to be able to play again, or you can buy the pro version but who wants that? I just wanted to play whenever I wanted to without paying extra for it... You maybe could allow us to play without achieving anything without the need for lives...' ,

      'They have fine a great job with this game. The dynamics, the playability, the graphics, and it feels as if you could never stop growing. Every bot is beast with a certain load out and play style.  Update! After playing for over 3 years, and over many different platforms this game rocks. It\'s definitely not the mech its the pilot kinda game. The balance is good so if you spend money and level quickly you\'ll be placed on your mechs rating(mech level + weapon level) so take your time and learn some tactics. Every gun has its purpose but it takes a good pilot to make them work.',
       'Game is designed to milk money out of its players. Fun to play. But $200 for a pretend robot or $100 for a single gun. Lower prices. You might be shocked more people can afford 20 than 200......reply- you think giving someone 15 pieces of a random bot that takes 2 games to earn if you place first out of the 10000 you need. Only real option they give is purchas. Don\'t be fooled. This is a pay to win game.',
       'A great game that brings back the old Mech warrior days. One of the few good theme fps shooters on this platform that is "FREE". You can pay to win but it will cost you alot. Investing afew tens to smoother the growth? But you can still have plenty of fun without spending a dime.  Until it slowly draws you in deeper.....',
       'I like how the game has gotten better over past year in many ways.. But could you guys quit making the puzzle peice stuff to get newest goodies? I get you added lots of cool ways to get extras that\'s cool and all.. But who wants 7 puzzle pieces out of 7,000? Not worth the effort. Keep it gold and silver guys!!',
       'This is a great game! I am having fun playing it since I downloaded it! these are my recommendations for the game, ya dont really need to add this but it would be much better if you did: 1.Can you please add a map that shows where you can and cant go. 2. Different controls would be nice, so I can pick what controls are best. 3. Last thing is, If you can change the position of the guns on the robots, but I think this is not gunna be added cause it would nearly change the game, but ya\'ll never know what devs can do right?',
       'Typical pay for play. Fun in the low levels then it becomes painfully obvious who are paying the big bucks. They will say everything can be obtained for free. While this is true. The amount of time and effort makes it not worth the hassle. To get the better robots you will pay a lot of money. $100 for a robot as a sale price in this game. It shuts off in the middle of the game tech support took their time responding and didn\'t address the problem. They say record and take pictures but they will not upload. In my opinion not worth the time.' ,

      'I never write reviews, but this game deserves all the praise possible. Downloaded it for my niece and turns out I am the one addicted!! I\'m a daily player now and love the fact that you can start your own group for 300 gems and approve applications and interact with your stylist association members. That aspect took the game to a whole new level. The clothing is beautiful and the attention to detail is great!!! Give it a shot and you just may become addicted like myself. I do spend around 20 bucks a week, but it was just as much fun before I was spending money, I just wanted the special clothes for events.',
       'In depth in both gameplay and attention to details of awarded items. Continuous hours not required but with once a day of incentive activities. Controls are  sometimes unstable. If a glitch does happen, its fixed fast and your also awarded for time spent. Very happy customer. Enjoyed the best dress up game I\'ve played so far. Thank you makers!',
       'I love the game. From its cute and addictive style to its unique and original dress up gameplay, it turned me from a dress up hater to lover. But I feel like there\'s a Paywall especially during events, and diamonds are forced to be bought, but they can be earned, which is good. But so far, you seem to have listened to feedback, from the skin tones to the bug fixes. But I love it still.',
       'I had seen many ads for it and was kind of interested, but I didn\'t think a dress-up game could be that fun. One day I couldn\'t find any games I wanted to play, so I decided to give it a shot. To my surprise, I am really enjoying it! So if you\'ve had any inkling of interest in this game, give it a shot. You might enjoying as much as I have.',
       'The dress up game all the others are trying to be like. Gorgeous, gorgeous, gorgeous and massively addictive. I got much more than I bargained for when I randomly downloaded because I am now an active daily player. There are a lot of things to spend money on if you are ok with that, but if you\'re savvy you can get a great experience without spending a dime. The fandom is friendly and active and with just a little searching you can find great resources online to take gameplay to the next level.',
       'I love this game. I don\'t really like these types of games but to my surprise I like this one. I have a suggestion, may you please allow the hairstyle double pony tails to be dyed into a dark purple (like the reddish purple colour you can dye the ace hairstyle)' ,

      'I like it a lot but I hate how the drawings are so linked with pokemon go. I hate pokemon go!!!!! The graphics are okay but I wish they were a bit better quality. It is confusing if you pick paint or something it just goes back to the original colour. I didn\'t like how easy the drawings were and I don\'t think the glow art works. It just comes out as crayon. I wouldn\'t recommend this game if you don\'t like colouring. It\'s ok!!!!',
       'I love this app! It\'s sooo good. And its brilliant for when your bored. But its a little hard sometimes to go over the lines with our fingers as the lines are so thin. But overall I think it\'s a fantastic app!',
       'I love this game but i don\'t like the characters tho .but it\'s fine . I like the way you can colour it in and then do the glow pen around it and at the end it looks amazing . You just colour and then press the pencil button ontop of the rubber in the pictures right bottom corner and then do the glow pen thing . Some people may don\'t know so that\'s why they don\'t like it . It\'s good when your travelling or when your bored . O THIS GAME IS AMAZING!!!I like it',
       'I think there should be more cartoons to draw and color. And it should not always be right colors to trace it in. Also i think that one small part of the picture shouldn\'t color the whole background, because what if you didn\'t want them bother the same exact color, because no affence, but it looks weird and ugly sometimes. Sorry for no compliments.                    LOVE, YOUR DEAR FRIEND!!!',
       'It\'s a great app however it keeps crashing and I have to start the drawing all over again. The whole app stops and my drawing starts over and it\'s really annoying. If this gets fixed I will definitely rate 5 stars',
       'Well the animals are cute and the drawings are cute, but I thought you could use the rainbow color like in the picture,but you can\'tüò¢you should still get this app and definitely of you like drawing. It\'s still fun though!üòÜ' ,

      'It\'s nice game - very nice graphic, very smooth moving - it would be 5 stars. BUT - I payed for levels 13 and 14 , and the game does not allow me to play in random order - it\'s not possible to play no. 23 without finishing all numbers before. If you are stuck in some number, you cannot go to another one - you MUST BUY hint!!! It means - you PAID for the game, but you MUST PAY again for hint - or you are blocked in PAID  game. It\'s just not fair.',
       'I loved flow free from a young age. I\'ve played until 9√ó9 pack but when I reached a certain level,  the game stopped working after that and I\'ve tried over and over again to go in but the game just keeps bring me back to the home screen and keeps stopping. Please fix it. I really want to play the remaining levels and packs',
       'Great game. Keep coming back to it. I find it relaxing solving the puzzles, though it has become super easy! All versions are great. All in all, awesome job! One of my favourites, and works in any situation. Quick break at work, something productive ? Play. Something to do before sleep? Play. Got a few extra mins? Play! Wanna challenge yourself on timed? Play! Haha.',
       'Fantastic game. Real addiction game I\'d say. It\'s an awesome time killer. Different types of levels never make the game boring. Graphics is okay. Number of ads for a free to play game is less compared to other games out in the market which is a relief.Overall I would give 4.5/5',
       'Love this app! I prefer the original version over the walls, hex, etc. and have solved every single one of them. Need more puzzles. Although I\'m sure I can solve them all again as it\'s impossible to remember these. Either way, I cannot get enough of them.',
       'Great game. Many levels, everyday new levels, easy and addictive gameplay. The only negative point i have are the hints. Why would you buy them and ruin your own fun? They are also overprized, for 30 hints you could instead buy all additional levels + the ad-free game. Hints are irrelevant and should be removed. But everything else? Nothing to go on about, top.' ,

      'Horrendous abuse of in game ads like I\'ve never seen before in an app. At some points, you literally cannot proceed until you open the play store. The game races are short balancing acts wherein you simply try to keep your car on its wheels. Do not download, and do not let your kids start playing.',
       'I\'ve been playing this app for a while now and up intil now I loved it but ever since the daily race-off challenge the game has been full of bugs. The daily race-off is a great idea but there are just too many bugs in it. I lose lives when I didn\'t even lose the race or I lose all my lives when I only lost one race.',
       'The game is my little boys favourite but the recent batch of adverts in game (Yahoo specifically) don\'t close - meaning you have to force quit the game. Lazy programming and terrible QA process from the developers. Avoid.',
       'Whoever decided to put the HW Poppa wheelie in the game is an idiot. Loved this game until i came across that car. Im seconds away from fully upgrading and moving on but i couldnt let it go. That car is a load of frustration.',
       'It\'s really really fun  ut the game restarts when I start an ad, or when it\'s finished with an ad. It also restarts after certain levels (depending on how longs it\'s been or what I lress). It\'s the only thinf that is annoying. Other than that, this game is addictive lmao',
       'Upgrading the vehicles makes little to no improvement to their performance, which makes the game too frustrating. For example you get stuck at exactly the same place without enough grip to go up a dumb hill no much how much you upgrade your car. There\'s no skill involved.  The game forces you to keep playing the same tracks until you get a better car.' ,

It\'s pretty quick to load back so it\'s still playable but it\'s definitely frustrating to have the restart the app constantly. One Plus 3',

       'The levels need more diversity. After a while it just the same level just faster or slower spinning. Maybe add challenges or spinning platforms. Also if you could pick a color then choose  knife that would be awesome.',

      'Yes this is addictive, yes it\'s fun, and it\'s great because you can spend 12 seconds or 12 minutes on it and still get the same amount of enjoyment. BUT, and this is a very big but, this game is a HUGE drain on your battery. And no, I don\'t have an iPhone - I have a proper phone - a Sony XZ Pro. So it\'s not the weedy battery. No game I have ever played drains the battery away as fast as this game does, so it\'s clearly an issue that I wish they could fix.',
       'I really liked the game but I hate the pay to win more stuff and all the ads and incentives to go download and play other games. I know that\'s what mobile games have become but I want to just enjoy a simple clicker game in peace without a thousand tie ins and adds ruining my sense of immersion. Oh vanilla cookie clicker how I miss you. The game itself is great. Tying in a leader board with a game that incentivizes you to pay real world money to increase your earning rate in game seems messed up, but once again that is what mobile games have become.',
       'Since the last update on don\'t get as much return back from my businesses as I used to. Of it isn\'t fix i will be deleting my game soon. Was fun 2 play, now it\'s not worth it.(edit) I\'ve had this review up for a month and not a single dev has looked at my review or care. They just want your money and do not care about their players.',
       'You should be connected to facebook. So when people change from iPhone to android, we can keep our levels. I just had to restart again and I had 6800 lemons and not much longer to complete the game. What an accomplishment I\'m going to try to receive this time',
       'Way way WAYYY too laggy. It\'s an easy casual game though. I wouldn\'t say it\'s "fun" but it does pass the time and make you want to achieve the little goals. Only goal, make more money in game. That\'s it and you achieve that by not even playing the game so there\'s no challenge whatsoever. Uninstalled after first day reaching about 500 Trillion and force closing 100 times.',
       'this is a scam! don\'t buy or do the free gold. they have denied my last 3 completed requirements for free gold.  Google Play will be hearing about this by filing a complaint against this game, it\'s advertisers, and anyone else involved! DO NOT DO FREE GOLD' ,

      'If you\'ve liked the first game you\'re probably gonna enjoy this one. It\'s more dynamic and there are plenty more content. Unfortunately it\'s built around microtransactions so if you\'re feeling like expending some money things might get easier. I just don\'t understand how they  screwed the controls this much, it\'s likely you\'re going to try placing a plant more than three times before making it.',
       'Great game. Lots of fun. For those who aren\'t aware: Some levels are super hard to beat BECAUSE THEY REQUIRE UPGRADED PLANTS. Level up gives you something to do in the game expanding its lifespan. Level up is not that easy. Don\'t expect to end all levels Ancient Egypt with level 2 plants; level 3 or 4 are fine!',
       'I love this game! One thing though, I believe that there are too many plants that cost real money to get. Could you please make some more plants that you can get them by being able to unlock them by playing the game, instead of ones where you have to use real money. Besides that, this is a really great game!',
       'I like this game so much, but after the last update the game is a bit laggy, and I noticed that only the normal level music plays every time no matter what type of level I am playing. For example: the ultimate battle theme and the minigame music are all missing. I am playing on Galaxy A5 2017.',
       'DON\'T WASTE YOUR TIME & MONEY! I made $17 in-game purchase and it crashed very next day. EA support is terrible. Contacted them 3 times but they have not been able to fix it.',
       'Free to play games are always the same formula: Starts off addictive, gets more challenging, starts encouraging you to buy gem equivalent, forces you to buy gem equivalent. At least most other games are fair with it though, giving you a chance. PVZ 2 does not. Levels go quickly from fun to I\'m done, and become impossible. I\'d love to see developers or game testers try to complete later levels without gems, especially Big Wave Beach. It\'s a shame, as the first game remains a classic. Buy the first game and Garden Warfare if you like it. Leaf this game alone, it\'s a sprout at best. Oh and remember, if zombies try to break into your house, throw your money at them.' ,

      'Fut can not be developed with this building team. Football is one of the most attractive games but how this fut goes? In Vs attack mode, what the hell meaning do chances have? Players must creat chances by themselves not the game. You must let them play whole game and create the chances by themselves. EA is a big builder in football games and develop a lot but have you ever thought how your fut only stands at this place?',
       'overall its an awesome game great experience. but Its hard for free to play players to complete and go through the events..... the icons are too difficult to get please make them a bit earlier to get, it will be awesome to have them in the team.... its difficult to get elite players in a pack of 500 fp totw pack n few others packs too... the vs attack mode is great.... EA please make sure that the free to play players to get a good experience of getting new and better players....',
       'This season is much better than the earlier. The developers are doing a very good job by listening to the users through Twitter. The Free to Play users will find it a but tough to get the best of the players. In App Purchases will help a lot in this game. But even without paying this game has a lot to offer. Addictive if you are football fan.',
       'Can you please make the following improvements then your game will rule the playstore. 1) Make your graphics good. Sometimes one can\'t even recognise the player. 2) Add  real referee there on the pitch. 3) Add a feature of commentary in all languages. 4) Add an option of the records of every individual player\'s stats, goals, assists and all. 5) Add some weather conditions,night mode, attendance. 5) Add a number of more celebrations and especially player\'s signature celebration.  Please take a look on my review and make the game more beautiful.',
       'The game is nice for every football fan.... Nice controls and good graphics...events are awesome... There r different game modes.. the only thing that I don\'t like after the recent update is that while playing campaign mode there are many stages which requires u to be in certain lvl in VS mode.... I think both the modes should be independent.. otherwise it\'s a fabulous game... The most awesome football game in play store right now.',
       'Vs attack mode is fine.... But there should be full online matches with substitutions(Like previous fifa versions).... Also one should also be able to search a player by country.... So country should also be added in the search criteria, Search functionality should also be provided in the reserve player lists... I have hundreds of players and its very difficult to search players with some specific criteria like country or club...' ,

      'I really enjoy this game, but I have found a flaw in the design. The game speeds up as you go and after a point it doesn\'t go faster, but after around 10,000 you notice the ball start to move forward on the screen and after about 20,000 you don\'t even have to move the ball to not die. It just misses the spikes. I know you might be thinking Its not on the leaderboards, but that\'s my next complaint. Im currently 6 on the leaderboards, but I\'ve gotten a better score and it won\'t update. I quite frankly destroyed that score and it doesn\'t show up. Thank you for your time and I hope this helped',

      'Love the game, easy to understand and they have videos on how to use the equipment and make ur farm expand. Also, their customer service is great!!  Recently my phone was stole and had to get a new phone.  Familyfarm helped me recover my farm within a couple of days.  Their services were quick and resourceful.',
       'Fun game, but...What happened?  Don\'t like the snow,  it lightened all the colors of everything, they are not as vivid as they usually are.. With cataracts,  too hard on eyes,  all print got really small and can\'t read anymore.  Will have to quit til eyes get fixed.',
       'I love the game and have played it for almost 5 years now but for some reason it will not connect to facebook. Not sure what happened in the last update. Hopefully it gets fixed soon. I would hate if my phone got messed up and my progress is not saved',
       'I\'d give full stars if there weren\'t so many glitches. How come the telescopes I load onto the pet house aren\'t counting for anything? I keep adding them but the number stays at 2. Automatic farm cleaning often doesn\'t reward. I have a pet collar that\'s glued onto my pet and can\'t be removed. Also the farmers market doesn\'t always allow you to get the reward at the end of the two hour slog :-/',
       'It\'s hard to progress in the game without enough RC (Ranch Cash) so I\'m basically stuck with the same quests for some time now. Not worth playing if you don\'t have it for the required items and you have to pay for more RC.',
       'I used to love this game. Played it everyday. Now things I\'ve purchased with the special currency have started disappearing?! I\'ve been in contact with support multiple times and they are completely unhelpful. They just repeat back what I wrote to them and say, I hope this helps! It doesn\'t. If I purchase a product I expect to receive it. I\'m not giving money to a charity this is a service just like everything else. Sadly, I have stopped playing the game now. Too many crashes and missing items that you work had to earn. Very disappointed.' ,

       'Angry Birds used to be a game you could just tap on and play to your heart\'s content.  Now it\'s gone fee-to-pay (sic) -- you can read the other reviews to see how well that has been received.   Not well is an understatement.  I\'d say more, but you\'ll have to gain 50 more stars to read each new paragraph.  Meanwhile, watch these unskippable half-minute-long ads.',
       'Between ads completely over running gameplay and the new requirement of having to earn stars to proceed, Rovio continues to run this once great game into the ground. **Update** game now freezes randomly requiring a force close. This is beyond ridiculous. I HATE what this franchise has become. Rovio should be ashamed.',
       'The Feb 08,2018 update has completely changed my opinion. The update makes the game unplayable for almost everyone now. I would have thought by now  that Rovio would have rolled back this version so we could play the game again. Obviously disappointing.',
       'Way too many advertisements. Completely ruins the fun of the game when you are interrupted so frequently. I understand they need a source of income, but I\'d watch far more ads overall if they weren\'t so painfully frequent.',
       'Wth ! Game gets hanged, as soon as you use mighty scope in mighty league. Not one time, or occasionally. Everytime since last update. WHAT A MESS ! Above that it repeatedly cannot find internet connection, be it WiFi or DataPack.  GIVING 3STAR, for good old game. If no fix found, will keep downgrading.' ,

       'Can be kinda fun, but the pixel art is pretty bad in a lot of ways. Like, color palettes with weird contrast and too many similar colors, inconsistent line widths that look like they drew the piece too small and scaled it up without paying attention, or like they just converted art drawn in another style to pixel art without fixing anything. Actually a lot of this would be explained if the app makers just put a pixel filter over traditional art pieces or digital paintings. Shows a lot of disrespect for this art form that you made your whole app about.',

      'It was fun while it lasted. I was a big fan of the first game and this one was an awesome improvement. Unfortunately my game crashed after months of playing and forced me to play the tutorial again. UPDATE: After reaching out to Pikpok customer service they reset my story progress and gifted me several leveled up weapons that help balance out what I lost. I appreciate their rapid response and look forward to playing more!',
       'After i reach chapter 4, suddenly all my weapons progress are gone,  then i contact the support team,  and they dont restore my previous weapons,  but they give me MORE than what i have before. üòÑ  I really happy with this,  and i really appreciate this.  You guys should try this game. This is AWESOME. Now it\'s time for me to kill more zombies üòé',
       'I give you guys a 5-star rating. The graphics are amazing. And the weapons are cool. The only thing. I wish we didn\'t have to have the stamina constraints. And it would be awesome if I was able to keep the extra ammo I find so I have it for future levels. And also its a pain in the ass to level up the guns all the damn time',
       'OMG. I definitely LOVE this. Better than the first. The storyline had me excited. Now it\'s more fun running with a goal. Love everything. I\'m on the lowest graphic settings but I still encounter minor lags. Oppo A83. But that\'s fine. I love how you can name your companion. Makes it more personal. Good job!',
       'Excellent story line... Great graphics. I have been addicted to this past few years. Really wondered seeing changes after every update. I never put up my reviews for any app. The magic is, whatever I think about new implementation - it will be done by pikpok in the very next update...... Now I have completed 7th Chapter. No clue what to do next...?',
       'Excellent game. I am totally addicted to it. Developers can you please include a reload button. Also sometimes playing I hit a wall or fence and it becones impossible to move left or right. In that case moving a couple of steps backward coukd save us in the game. Please include these options for making the most out of it. Overall its an excellent game and I highlh recommend it.' ,

      'Think about playing all day Ridiculously good graphics for a mobile game, excellent soundtrack that matches the intensity of each level, and never gets boring. The free version makes you restart from the beginning instead of checkpoints, but I don\'t even mind because it\'s still challenging and fun with each replay. I do wish I could play in a different mode for free though. This would be an awesome Zen game.',
       'So fun Great graphics and its super fun and addictive especially if you like beating your own score. I gave 4 stars because I paid the 2 dollars for the full version but I find that it doesn\'t save where I\'m at very well... Like if I leave the game and come back to it the last level I completed won\'t be saved. Other than that its really awesome and challenging. Hope I can get past level 8!',
       'I am going crazy for this game. Great time killer and stress reliever. Graphics, music, and everything else is completely superb. I am totally enthusiastic about purchasing the premium version, however, I could not buy it because I do not have any credit or debit card. Can someone please tell me if there is other ways to purchase, like deducting the fee directly from my SIM balance, perhaps?',
       'Smash Hit Smash hit is awesome because it has a lot of intensity in the game so I get to let my brain work a little.  It kinda let your brain decide if your should hit it or not. I also really like this game because the game is kinda hard so it challenges me a little bit. So who ever made this game I appreciate it. One more thing about Smash Hit is that it brings my family together because we take turns playing the game to let our brain think. Thank You!',
       'Spectacular Shockingly Good Game This game is addicting and amazing who thought breaking glass could be so fun. I mean somebody thought of something random when they made this. I I love it it is just so amazing. If only the person who thought of it made the game so that you didn\'t have to pay for some stuff like extra levels. Still if you\'re reading this and you\'re questioning if you should download this or not you definitely should.! üòâüòÄ‚ò∫',
       'I love this game.  It\'s very simple, just go without getting hit by glass or running out of balls, but it is a lot harder than it sounds.  I am forever telling myself I have time for just one more attempt, it is very addicting.  The 3d design on this is amazing and creative.  Up at the top it says to write a SHORT review, so this will end here.' ,

      'The game is awesome. It is funny, has some challenges, it\'s community is friendly and you can collect familiars. Also you can use your equipment as costumes if you like a specific item\'s look. =D And I didn\'t even talk about the way the game looks like... It\'s the best pixel art I have seen in a while. =) So stop reading and start playing, have fun and thanks for making this game Developers! =D ( The only thing I miss is more coop gameplay =\'D )',
       'Cute, adorable and haven\'t seen any hungry money grabbing offers. Game is relaxing and you can even 5x the speed during battle. Other games would want to bite your wallet for that special feature. Get to recruit familiars from battle and it has an auto feature just in case you get lost. The items change how your characters look and you can pretty much be whatever you like. Good overall game, will be playing for a while üòÄ',
       'Great game and a lot of fun but... waiting for energy REALLY kills this game for me. I really don\'t feel energy limitations should be part of of a dungeon crawler where the object of the game is to run random dungeons for the chance of better loot.  I for one will never spend money on refreshing my energy in a game like this and the energy refresh costs are pretty high.   I feel like it be playing this game none stop if it weren\'t for the energy restrictions.   Otherwise good game and very enjoyable - when I can play.',
       'The perfect MMO RPG for your phone in my personal opinion. If you\'re a fan of dungeon games then this is the game for you. With its cute design, simple combat systems, dungeon patterns and loot systems, you\'ll find yourself easily sucked into the MMORPG world of Bit Heroes. Fight your way through the dungeons and gear up to strike fear imto the creatures who dwell within as well as the other players in challenging PvP matches.',
       'Spent over ¬£200 in game and no legendary pet or accessory. This game uses RNG and it\'s extremely low you can\'t advance past a certain level unless you spend lots of money and even then you have to be extremely lucky to get legendary pet or accessory. Guilds won\'t take you without legendary pet or accessory. Don\'t waste your time on this PAY 2 PLAY game',
       'Perfect, very close to the perfect ultimate bit adventure rpg! I look forward to expanded versions. For this one the only issue i have is when i accept or decline a friend request, and i think duels, the request text lingers above for white someone even tho i already accepted/declined. Great work tho! I love this game!' ,

      'Game is really great! Amazing graphics, amazing cars, lots of continuous fun! A few bugs and connection issues which can be frustrating at times especially when your team depends on you for points. Though I believe they\'ll eventually fix these issues as this is the BEST racing game out there and it\'s only getting BETTER!',
       'Best onlin3 mobile racing EVER!! IM A VETERAN GAMER AND THIS GAME IS HANDS DOWN TOP OF THE MOBILE RACING GAME. Great detail and graphics. Precision tuning. REALISTIC CARS IN ALL ASPECTS. PLUS an added Bonus is it features FAST AND FURIOUS AND CARS FROM THE SERIES. I need access to more cars. Its so hard to get more silver or gold to get newer cars updated.',
       'Excellent work guys...... I really enjoyed the first game and the story was really exciting. The graphic in the sequel is incomparable. The only thing that bugs me is the repeated advertisements. It is amazing how you guys managed to incorporate all the real time cars and brands. In a nutshell, this game is one of the mature games that I have enjoyed recently.',
       'Customer support has won me over. They have literally provided the best resolution can think of for the game removing all my fusion parts. Hopefully I don\'t have many issues in the future but this one time moment has definitely filled me with confidence that in future, zynga will fairly sort things out.',
       'Excellent graphics and easy to upgrade but the live races leave something to be desired,  you start off the same way you do on single player mode against the story line but in live race it makes me sit at starting line for almost 2 full seconds before I can take off. I have unlimited data and full bars with my service, defiantly not worth the effort on live races.',
       'Prepare to have your pockets emptied with very little support if anything goes wrong and trust me it will. From losing fusion parts to losing your account and connection issues that have been present for the last few months. Don\'t worry though you will get bombarded with cars that cost a small fortune from events and a new special offer every now and then tempting you to pay more money. If anything ateast the devs are consistent and are very good at taking your money off you but putting in as little effort to fix things as possible' ,

      'This game is just impossible to finish, even if you spend lots of real money. 66% of the game (trick and powder) is about pulling tricks out and you can\'t even choose which ones.

      'Before the update it was quick to grind lots of cash but still it took some time. With my current build, I was reaching 10k+ averaging Greats and Awesomes but now after the update I barely scratch 8K! You guys nerfd the fuccc out the rocket power!!! NEW PLAYERS DON\'T EVEN BOTHER WITH THIS! IT WILL TAKE YOU A VERY, VERY, VERY LONG TIME TO GRIND!!!',
       'The game itself is awesome, really awesome. But my god, there is too many ads, It is okay to have ads in a free game, I totally understand, the dev has worked to build a game so it is fair to receive money back for the work.  But here there are too many ads, there is ad in game, there is ad when you lose a match and there are the famous win coins for watching a video.  Couldn\'t find an option to buy the game and remove the ads, hope the developer improve this, because the is really awesome...',
       'Good game, played it over a long period here and there and I\'ve basically completed it.  Would love to see more planets! And bigger challenges, as currently every time I go on it my little explorers are making over 1.5 million a day and I\'ve got no where to take my space funding! Haha   Great game imo, just needs more features, planets, asteroids maybe. :) Good job.',
       'A very fun game that is both simple and a bit challenging because you have to make literal split-second taps to get it to work properly. The only downside is that it\'s a very short game. There are only two places to colonize and once you\'ve done them and reached level 10 on both, there\'s really nothing left to do. It would be nice if they added more levels to colonize or some other form of continuation.',
       'Be cool if there is boosts. Example if you get 3 perfect you get a free auto perfect boost or something. Also plz add a line of code to stop people from the date/time bug abuse - save current time to file. Player won\'t get money till that last input time has passed.  Also be cool to spend the coins on boosts',
       'Very cool and challenging. 20 seconds game that has taken several hours. Graphics are amazing and victory audio also. Needs lot\'s more planets and more ships, only 2 planets is a shame. Speed and other gages would be nice. A flag in each planet. Ads didn\'t bother me that much. 5 stars for the team' ,

Please reply or just update. Thank you.',

       'Great game to pass time. Adverts are frustrating but necessary unless you want to pay to stop, BUT very annoying when they pop up as you just lifted a puzzle piece and because of advert it just drops randomly. Also being able to rotate pieces would be handy, granted not as challenging however.' ,

      'Was an awesome game Very addictive game! Was well done.. until the update. Needs more pens and new themes as I have thousands of coins but nothing left to unlock. Bugs: Pineapples that give you coins don\'t register as pineapple hits for the counters. There\'s a glitch where the fruit jumps to the opposite side of the screen. Graphics bite the big one though.. fix it',
       'Fun and addictive but... Very fun and addictive game except for the fact that it takes approximately 60.56 MB... an app this small (but still amazing) shouldnt consume that much of my space. Unless you have more items in the games files which will be soon added, but if its not that than Im... puzzled.',
       'Addictive  I play this game everyday when I wake up. I find it flawless, I have had no problems with this game, not even adds! The only thing I dislike is the title ( it did not effect my rate), why is it only pineapple pen? What happens to apple pen and PPAP? Anyway I love the modes and pens ( the surfboard is my fav pen) one again they are flawless. I think that Ketchapp is pure genius.',
       'Its good but nobody is changing the theme. Back to normal. Its still christmas. It seems like an abandoned game yet i think it was pretty popular among non ketchapp game players. If ur not going to keep up with the changing theme at least put it back to regular n take it off holiday.',
       'BEST GAME EVER!!! (one of the best games ever) it doesn\'t have any adds which is great! Love all the different types of pineapples & apples. What\'s bad about this game? Nothing. Which is good especially for me because I\'m not that patient. I would recommend that you should have this game.',

Everytime I set a new and higher record I want to achieve and I only stop until I get there xD atm with 6400 coins and everything unlocked üòÅüòÅ please release new content for months and months!!

      'Loved the game but if the life was free this waiting for minutes to play again is not cool. Also noticed if you have to score more than 1 goal and you make a mistake you have to start from the same goal you already scored. If we can get the requirements before each challenge that would make it much more fun otherwise I love this game a lot keep updating for more seasons. Thank you. I am on Level 560 with 1257 stars I am awaiting Season 29. If you can also create a full football game with same concept. This is a Great game!!! Thank you developers keep developing Great games like these!!!',
       'Wonderful! Game by first touch   But I can\'t wait till the hearts üíö are filled!  So Reduce the time. Improve this game more and more and create a new exciting games.  I have finished 390 levels. And I have a doubt what is the last level and what happens after it? All the best for ur future and I\'m a biiiiiiig fans of u guys!!  Hands off',
       'SCORE  HERO RULES This game is so sick dudes. It so cool that this gives us idea that how to play soccer or football. Gameplay is so smooth . They players show us some epic skills . It has an commentary. The worst part was the heart. I can\'t wait till it get refilled ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§ this. Graphics are great . Just reduce the time of refilling the energy . Overall this game cool. Thanks for the game FTG.',
       'Most irritating game plan.  Have any one ever seen in real game that if a player miss a goal then all the previous goals are cancelled? But in this game such thing is happening. You should not cancel all the goals scored only for a miss or loss of a ball. Goals should be saved and to be started from where it stopped for missing a goal or losing a ball. Developer should take it into his consideration.',
       'I am crazy about this game, I cant stop playing. Real time killer. The only problem i have is the fact that we get rewarded with credit not that often and its very little compared to cost of the additional upgrade options of the hero player. Finally the game can be very frustrating at times as the cpu makes unneccesary and stupid foot mistakes leading to start all over again with that level. Thanks',
       'This now a prize example of a freemium game that needs a premium option. I would gladly pay ¬£10 as a one off purchase to do away with the need to say for lives. In the past games worthy of a one-off fee would offer it and this issue such game that should consider it. I will never pay for any in app purchases on any game and I am sure I am not alone. This has 5* written all over it but the long wait times and exorbitant cost of energy replenishing means this doesn\'t get anything higher than average.' ,

       'Very,very poor controls...I selected "tilt" as my as my steering method I couldn\'t drive very effectively therefore I wasn\'t able to pick up people quickly enough so I received one star. The ads in this game are horrid, after every level an ad pops up. Please fix these mistakes,thank you. P.S. This was written by an 11 year old..sorry if my grammar isn\'t correct :)' ,

      'The first time I played I easily got over 800, now I swear the game upped it\'s difficulty like crazy, I can\'t get past the 200s. Not sure if it\'s a bug, an Easter egg feature or what, or if it\'s because I completed challenges but I don\'t appreciate the inconsistency especially when playing against friends and I don\'t feel evenly matched :(',
       'Its a fun game, really, however in my opinion its too easy. I got 150 First try and 346  my second. and maybe consider adding things to unlock like different balls or hoops. other than that its a fun game to kill time',
       'So many words but after u got all the  things there is nothing to do bar from play on it but it a  really good game love it soooooo much',
       'The problem is that every time it asks me if I would like to continue I say yes and then kicks me out of the game',
       'I got this game just so I can beat my friends high score... lol',

      'Great. It was working fine i used to have fun playing it before it did the last update! But after that, things changed. The game lost its memory i suppose it isnt loading my account! It starts from the start my all strategy is gone now if you could plz fix that tell me other wise ill have no choice but to uninstall this game.',
       'Need serious balancing. I\'ve just completed chapter 2, throughout this time I have played countless duel and never been awarded with a single legendary chest it is so disappointing(Epic chest just once). And also the chances of getting legendary card is super duper rare Ive only got 2 card so far. So can you please make little bit easier to get legendary chest and card.  In duel I have experienced opponents 300-400 plus skills than me. Which is way to hard for compete. So take skill points also on consideration for finding opponent.  And finally, there should be a list of cards available on game so that player can have better expectations on card.',
       'The game is buggy and needs some work. For me the game does not go ahead and it points on Unlocking the chest when the other chest is in process of Unlocking. None of the functions work, clearing cache, dalvik has no impact. Game works only after uninstall and again install.  Edit : the game is super smooth now . The shadow energy required to upgrade an element is increased manifold without corresponding increase in drop chances of epic and legendary chest. Hence a star removed.',
       'I have given 5 stars earlier because it was early in the game. Even in chapter one, you can\'t really progress because there is no way to make more coin other than the side quest which needs hours to refresh. In the end, you kinda not able to do anything but wait. You can\'t even replay earlier fights to earn some coins. Different mechanics than the 2. Boo.. Uninstaling..',
       'I am sorry to say that I am very disappointed. This game could be amazing but you basically get put at a standstill and cannot go any further unless you spend money. There are enough ads on here and that is fine and very understandable. There needs to be more options to upgrade your equipment and so forth without having to spend money. There needs to be more options like watching more ads or playing different rounds of different games to upgrade whatever it may be just being at a standstill because I can\'t afford to buy an upgrade is very disappointing',
       'Few suggestions: 1. Add an escape roll or a quick recovery move when downed 2. Beating an opponent in duel should reduce the opponent\'s trophies. It will help in balancing match ups that appear in duels 3. Add an option to discard chests after winning a duel. It\'s most definitely a pay to win game  right now.. hope it gets better' ,

      'Hello! I\'ve seen this game many times from the ads and I tried installing it and later found that this game was really intertaining and fun. Anyways, I am having problems with the game\'s connectivity to the internet. I am using 4G in playing the game and it seems that it does not connect very well, other online games connect well to the internet. I think that is the only issue I have in mind. Just hoping for more smoothness though.. But I love the game, it is worth the time playing. Thank you!!',
       'I dont know why you chosen Retro style graphic and i hope for a change. There is a lot of IRANIAN players but PING is over 250ms and too much delay. Add iran flag. Google play sign-in is not working. Add more skins. Events are just bunch of objectives and prizes, add more artworks and stuff for events. Other things are good for now. Thanks for the revolutionary IO game. Congratulation on 10million downloads üíù',
       'simple, fun, addictive gameplay, good graphic with unique animations, great events that keep players active which is good, have great potential. dark adventure loading still takes too long, i already dead when the loading is finished. crashing and some bugs in event tab. talking about awaken system, man atleast dont downgrade the stars or reduce the percentage of downgrade, finding awaken item is already damn hard. this great game need new character and more feature but not p2w. keep the good work barbarq !!',
       'YOU GUYS ACTUALLY LISTENED!!! Im so happy right now because when I saw theres a new update, I immediately downloaded it to see if I can play it without crashing. I can actually play it now with my friends! A little bit of framrate drop but still... I can play this wonderful game. Im going to totally recommend this game to my friends. The devs of this game are the best devs in the Google Play Store. Again, Im truely greatful and I thank you guys. :D',
       'It is the best game I\'ve ever played! With simple graphics and gameplays, you won\'t notice how long you\'ve played! Generous with presents daily and very recommended to spend time. However with the new update, I can\'t connect and it stayed on connecting. Tried to change internet source, but to no avail it\'s still there.  I would like to ask the developers, to reply as soon  as possible, on what should I do to get rid of this problem.',
       'Feels like lots of players are AI bots. I\'ve won my first 10 matches with a 10+ holyshit mega kill every time. Looks a bit pay to win as a champ you must buy has a very OP skill. The amount of awakening to hit 5 and get the extra skill is astronomical and will require money to be spent. Also, not one person is speaking English. It\'s all Spanish/Portuguese.' ,

      'I enjoy the game--very much in the vane of classic sonic racing games, with a lanes mechanic and some mariocart-esque abilities. The micro transactions speed up game play and can help progress your character, but won\'t make up for being a bad racer. Instead of transactions you can often watch ads. Typically, the ads are a fair trade off, but some are nearly game breaking. An Airbnb one is running right now that cannot be exited after watching on my OnePlus 5.  Otherwise, 5 stars.',
       'Decent game but why are there so many rings? I mean literally I have 1000s and the only thing it seems you can spend them on is upgrading your characters. This nesitates you having other pieces for each character which take ages to get then when you finally have enough of those bits it\'s like 1000 rings to upgrade them... Which is absolutely nothing... Give me something else to spend them on or up the price for upgrading characters... Obviously.',
       'An addictive game that never gets old. With the unpredictable players and teir upgrades, there is always a challenge. I have a few friends who play this game, and while it\'s fun to watch them, being able to play against them would be amazing. Also, the graphics for me are a bit janky (the device is fairly new) and isn\'t pleasing to the eye. The smoother, the better, like chocolate.',
       'Very enjoyable play on the Sonic Dash formula and the microtransactions aren\'t as obnoxious as they could be. Occasionally get a loading screen bug that necessitates force quitting and restarting. There are so issues with certain sound effects playing even when SFX is muted and when connected to a Bluetooth speaker all sounds play even when muted.',
       'This game is great! It\'s good to pass time and have fun!   The only thing I have to say is that sometimes, when it goes to the loading screen of the players, it gets frozen. Then I have to exit the game. And sometimes there\'s a lag in the gameplay.  Other than that, it\'s a great app to have fun running with Sonic and the other characters!',
       'The game itself not quite optimise. Im using huawei nova 2i and it lags even on the low setting.my phone can run any other graphic demanding games smoothly.. But this game lags on low.. Hope your team can optimise this game.I wish the game had vs mode. So you can compete with friends nearby.. Otherwise its a good game..' ,

       'Fun',
       'I dig it overall. The controls to set the pieces take a bit of getting used to, but I understand why they did it this way. Your finger starts where it should, but moved slightly lower than the finishing point. This way your finger is out of the way and you can clearly see where your piece is going. Very fun game with lots of options.',
       'A bit too difficult to work out. Good game but sometimes the positioning of beams just didn\'t seem to lock on the way it was suggested they should during tutorial parts. Tried multiple times but chucking the towel in on this one.',
       'The game\'s alright, the good part is especially to see the vehicle going through the bridge! Overall, It\'s an awesome game. Might not be the most awesome, but this is one of the games you\'d play to pass the time' ,

      'A very fun and addictive game. I make bows all day, but it\'s nice to be able to shoot from my couch at night.  The influence of wind on the arrow is accurate when it comes to drift. A little costly on the upgrades for those that don\'t buy their way to the top, but all games are that way.',
       'Ok game, but bingo mode is a huge pain.  My shots filled out the opponent\'s card better than mine.  Stupid way to lose a lot of progress/coins.',
       'Game was fine. Lately, keeps freezing and somehow opponents are getting 10\'s when I CLEARLY see them hitting nowhere near the middle. Matches are freezing while i\'m ahead, then match ends and says I lost. Somehow i\'ve lost 20 million coins, and not from legit losing either. I also just played a match for 1 million coins, i had over 1 million in the bank. I know sonehow have 0 after I clearly won the match but it said I lost. Either people are using cheats or the game is not functioning properly',
       'It\'s really pathetic that apps like this only allow Facebook login... At least provide Google login too.... Not everyone uses Facebook.... Google should make it mandatory on Google play store apps to provide Google login....',
       'It feels like I\'m playing a cpu, because the first cup is easy and my opponents only score very low points. I mean, I score 8-10 and my opposition have a hard time hitting the mark at all! (I\'ve repeatedly played it a handful of times.)',
       'Good  game when it works. Seems to run out your  time  and  freeze  up  when  you start  winning  to  much' ,

Logged back in to Dragon City through Google games and guess what it has reset my acvount. I was level 17 and now I have had to start again from level 1. But when checking achievements all my achievements from my original account are all there. WHERE HAS MY ORIGINAL ACCOUNT GONE. Wil give 5 stars if this is fixed...',
       'Where is support? I have gem confirmation enabled but it\'s just taken 70 gems without warning. I\'ve also done extras to win gems but they haven\'t been added. There needs to be a cancel button like on food etc. Need to say time it will take to hatch eggs etc. When doing challenges it should say exactly what you need to do and spend so you aren\'t guessing. Besides these issues, I am really enjoying this game. It\'s easy and fun. I just wish you didn\'t need to spend so much to get further in the game.',
       'This one of the coolest city building games I\'ve ever played in my life, and the various types of dragons blows my mind. I play this for hours and hours and it\'s insane gameplay because the choices of breeding dragons is vast. I also love the fact that you can battle with the dragons currently available to do so. I 1000%+ recommend downloading this game, and I\'d give it 5+ rating for EVERYTHING. BEST GAME EVER!!!!!üòÉ',
       'I love this! The events are hard to progress in but not so hard that you will want to punch your phone/tab. Breeding and hatching always surprises you because you don\'t Know what dragon you will get. Cool and good. Also heroic races can be made easier by using these tips: breed double terra and terra 15 second breed and hatch time then if u need to feed for a task then breed a new terra when it gets too expensive. And use the fastest food. I don\'t buy gems for races I\'m probably gonna win the heroic dragon' ,

      'I wish I could post pictures, but the game is too easy. I beat the first 2 levels both on one attempt. Though I am an experienced geometry dash player. But if I can beat a level first try, not knowing the course at all, that\'s some easy stuff. I highly recommend geometry dash sub zero though.',
       'Great fun but needs more levels. I laughed when I saw a review made by an idiot because he said this was a copy of the Impossible Game LOL it\'s the other way around, dumbass.',
       'THIS GAME IS AWESOME PLZ MAKE THE COMING SOON Levels Music kind of more like the seven seas music THANKS and also I rated 5 stars on every thing on this game and P.S. could you please make the coming soon levels more faster dear fellows, thanks',
       'I love every Geometry Dash version! And this one might be the best. But my only downfall is that the music, which is freaking awesome,gets ahead of the actual gameplay and I miss my jumps. Plz fix and I\'ll rate 5 stars! But keep up the good work!',
       'I think this game is going to change your life once you start is going to test you all you know you need to be focused to pass the whole entire thing and make sure you try to get all the coins good luck out there and may the best guy win or woman',
       'Incredible as always. Level design is amazing and the graphics are spot on. However, controls are wanky on mobile and makes a few techniques way harder than they should be. There also should have been more levels.' ,

      'Purchasing the other ponies is worth it. Don\'t know why other people are complaining. It\'s only 5 dollars, you could get a DQ lunch for 5 dollars. Anyways, game is amazing. What\'s cool is that you can reset your progress so you can have fun all over again. Amazing work Budge Studios!',
       'This game is my 5 yr olds favorite thing to do during trips. She loves the music and animation, and the gameplay is entertaining enough to keep her engaged. It\'s definitely worth the few bucks to get the add free version.',
       'Pay to play mechanic. Seems rather predatory for a game targeted for younger CHILDREN. Not to mention the constant barrage of ads that can only be removed by paying for ponies which shouldn\'t be EA\'d. Outside of that the game is enjoyable but the paywall issue is a problem. Devs... you should feel bad about yourself.',
       'Installed it, launched it, after the bungie screen was presented by a full screen ad for some game involving a woman + handcuffs + panties. Not a good look for a game aimed at children, my 6 year old was standing behind me.',
       'Ads popped up every 45 seconds. I timed it. Made the game useless for my son (4). And he really wanted to play it too.',
       'My daughter loves this game so much! Good job guys. However we need your help, i made a purchase to unlock all ponies, however, somehow they got locked again and we needed to purchase again to unlock everyone. It was kinda disappointing, please help us on this matter.' ,

      'It is inexcusable to allow ads to make such noise when both my phone is in silent mode AND I have the sound off in the game settings! I went over other reviews and the developers wanted to know which ads. Seriously?! How about all of them?! They have to be aware yet refuse to fix the problem. Do not download this intrusive app. Also I get a migraine with the annoying "Ready? Let\'s go!" voice when the sound is on.',
       'Great strategy based game, awesome, however out of 326 levels only 323 could be completed. Level 324 the colors are not chain linked they are totally erratic and the colors you\'re given are inconsistent. They alternate in color as well to ensure failure. Still I enjoyed it. Side note, I played the game without using any cheats, which is the reason level 324 is a trapdoor the idea is to purchase cheats. Thanks great game.',
       'Fun, but... Worst aim system. You can see ball curve away instead of following straight path. Color balls rotate without your input. You are shooting blue, but yellow goes instead. This happens very frequently. Lastly, had 20 straight of same color. Only needed one of another color to finish that level. Still playing, but game is very frustrating.',
       'Takes so long to start a level you have lost interest in the game before it starts. Keeps my attention for about 30 secs. Phone will not respond to button presses after game has finished.',
       'Annoying ads with sound even i off d sound , if u need a life they forced u to see the ads first there is no option to buy energy power by u\'r point still u want then they are selling in $ ... and lots more... Bad experience i m going to uninstall the app.',
       'The coding in this game obviously needs work.  Balls given not colors needed.  Spot aimed at missed and ball lands somewhere else.  The last chest I opened lvl 30 something gave no item.' ,

Mistakes where im placing a piece sometimes, has no undo function & has forfeited on my behalf twice while I was offline, in about 5% of my games. Just started randomly flipping the board which is confusing. Buttons don\'t work. Freezes. Currently won\'t notify me of needed moves or show me list of active games.  Tired of reinstalling',
       'Fun and simple design, however the AI is a little dumb.  At the end of some games, it will call a draw by stalemate, even though you can clearly still pull a win.  Like one game it was just the opponent\'s king left, and I still had both rooks, a bishop, and queen.  It called a draw!',

      'To anyone saying the magnometer should be free; no, it shouldn\'t.  You guys are requesting it be free because it is in demand, which is exactly why it is for sale.  Parents don\'t let you buy things on the app?  Good. The magnometer is something EXTRA that is absolutely not necessary for the app to function.  Sure, it can help make the right move; that\'s why you have to pay for it... Without the Magnometer, you are playing a free chess app.  With the Magnometer, you are playing a free chess app and paying for it to help analyze your moves.  You are not entitled to a free move analyzer to help guide you simply because you want it to be free.  That\'s not how economics works, hate to break it to you.  There are many, many ways to analyze moves, positions, and get better at chess; the Magnometer is not and will never be the best way to do so. It is simply an added convenience that you can choose to pay for to help you find or analyze a move/position.',
       'Feels great to have a simulated match with a Magnus-like computer AI opponent. Will definitely destroy you even at the lower age levels. The only thing I don\'t like in the app is the gray color graphics of the board and the chess pieces. The upside about this is you can surely change that setting if you got the appropriate in-game currency to purchase a different color scheme, with some playthroughs that are needed first to be able to get them.',
       'Good job It seems like that you are not paying this app any attention anykmore. I dont understand what was the need of another Magnus Trainer app. You coukd have very well integrated the same fuctionality here. You closely missed the opportunity to create the best chess app in the world. Alas....',
       'Sound effects and graphics are distractingly poor. Missing basic features like turn confirmation. You can see a video on YouTube of Magnus himself making a mistake in placing a piece using this app.',
       'This chess game is very good, I would give it five stars except for an internal error that will not post my record of wins, losses and ties against Magnus. Maybe I fried the memory with all my losses...üòÅ',
       'Love the idea behind it. Well executed and a really fun feel to the game. Wish there was a 3d board option- have always found flat 2d chess board graphics frustrating to read.' ,

       'It\'s a very good game! I got my boyfriend hooked on it, but my problem with it is, sometimes when I start up the app it sits on the beginning stage of the app?? Like when am I going to be able to play again? Was just updated? So I\'m going to have to delete it and start it all over and re gain my high score??',
       'There are wayyyy too many ads seriously. You don\'t need that many ads for your game you have enough money you have a bursting game brand . Most of your games don\'t even have as many ads. Every failed turn "here\'s an ad buy my game!!!!" No!!!',
       'The *only* complaint is the frequent,  long 30 second ads after nearly every single round.  It\'s quicker to close the app and reopen,  but either way,  it\'s annoying enough to not want to play the game.   Other than that,  this is a fun game! :D',
       'WAYYYYY too many adds. There is an add after EVERY round. That\'s annoying. The game is great, but that\'s NOT how to get people to purchase it. Please consider lessening the adds to maybe once every 5 minutes, and not every 5 seconds!!' ,

      'Downloaded this through another app (free golden eagles) where if you downloaded and played this game, and got castle to level 10 would be rewarded. Sent off request to support a number of times with proof and no reply, and after a week still no reward.   So if you are downloading this to get reward from another app don\'t bother as you won\'t get it',
       'I like the game but it is hard for players who can\'t buy a lot of packs. Some slight tweaks to make it not so slanted towards big spenders.  Maybe make some exchange rate for silver to gold without changing the silver availability or price. Someway that gold can be acquired beside the little in the ground. I understand the game has to make a profit and so you should but more people would continue to play instead of giving up Anyway just a couple of thoughts. Got plenty more on just general gameplay  that I think would be useful. Again, not hating as I like and play the game.',
       'Pure pay tto win. You will either pay or quit out of frustration. Build times are hilarious. Seriously, our Earth\'s sun will die before you max out your hero\'s knowledge or most any other knowledge.  The Stronghold is worthless and a huge waste of resources. It\'s more of a trophy.  Sure you can join a clan, get some bonuses and buy some shields with points, but you will be destroyed by the winners. Me, I had a gift card and blew on this game, now I just start fights and make people quit.',

      'Stupid game. I spent so much time on it building just for a higher leveled person to come in a destroyed it to point i couldnt rebuild. Not worth time spent on rebuilding things if higher leveled people just continuously attacking lower leveled teams and wiping them out. Only shows u have to have money to play this game to level up to defend. Im not spending a dime on this retarded game',
       'I\'m impressed. This really is a fun game. And with all of the aid, events and rewards there are you really don\'t need to pay to win. There\'s a lot to learn so you may feel a bit lost at first but it keeps the game from being repetitive. I didn\'t think this would be a 5 star game but after 2 weeks of playing I can tell you that it certainly is. A+ üíØ',
       'A whole lot of effort to get anything done. They\'re constantly trying to sell you things at obnoxious prices and if you don\'t buy them you\'re setting yourself up to be abused by those foolish enough to waste their money on this game.',
       'Overall a great fun game. The only complaint I have is the rate at which it takes to get an officer. Like all games they try their hardest to get you to spend money but I absolutely refuse to spend any actual more wy on a game. So the way they try to squeeze cash out of you is by making it almost impossible to get an officer. So be very aware about your officers cuz if you don\'t want to spend any cash like me, it\'ll take you FOREVER to gain a new officer. Other than that, awsome game!',
       'Great graphics and addictive but not alot of explanation on how to do things. Too many updates in short amount of time,  too long of a waiting time on researches. You need to spend money if you want to keep up with the rest and you\'re placed up against players alot more stronger so always have to go protection buffs. Not an even playing battlefield.',
       'Really not happy I have spent loads off money over time on buying gold in the game and packs.. I have had major glitches in the game that have made it a waste of my time and money I have lost over 10 advanced teleports on the game and when I contact your customer service team they don\'t even reply to me.  I find this very bad customer service and that all u want to do is take my hard earned money and not even reimburse me what I have lost.i really enjoy playing this game but this is making me want to not play any more' ,

He might run at the first sign of danger, but when it comes to helping his friends, he‚Äôs always ready to step in! Fred is the glue that keeps Mystery Inc. together, and his mind is always two or three steps ahead of the monster they‚Äôre after. He sees mysteries as a chess match, and nothing makes him happier than planning genius and elaborate traps to catch ghosts, vampires, bogeymen and more!Brave, beautiful and brainy, Daphne is the most enthusiastic member of Mystery Inc. She never leaves home without her camera and her notebook because someday she wants to be either a famous mystery writer or an investigative journalist. Velma is the resident smart kid of Mystery Inc. Her hyper-analytical mind deciphers clues almost as fast as she can say ‚ÄúJinkies!‚Äù Although the group tries to stick together, Velma often ends up wandering off by herself, searching for the next clue. A Great Dane with an even greater appetite, Scooby-Doo reluctantly chases ghosts and ghouls with the rest of Mystery Inc. Although Scooby-Doo is always up for an adventure, he prefers activities that end with an all-you-can-eat buffet. When his friends need him, Scooby-Doo will run to the rescue! His best friend in the whole world is Shaggy, and you can usually find the two of them running away from a monster or snacking on double-decker sandwiches in the back of the Mystery Machine.For app support contact LEGO Consumer Service.

      'Maybe the reason people think its boring. It\'s probably because they are boring and lame. I beat the first level without a problem, they didn\'t because they feel like everything should be easy and they shouldn\'t have to work hard for anything. The game is challenging and fun if you like a challenge. If your a lame, whinny, expect nothing to be hard, and can\'t handle a challenge as tough as making toast, then this game isn\'t for you.',
       'These other reviewers are jerks! Lol. The game is awesome! And my 4 year old can even play it well!  I like it so much, I\'m downloading it onto my phone (4 yr old plays it on my old phone)  just to see how far I can get lol',
       'I would get to the title page and that was it. It won\'t let me go further. I have turned my phone off and back on and I have uninstalled it twice and installed it 3 times. Please fix.',
       'The game controls are very annoying. The character won\'t go where you want him to. During the boss fight he keeps getting stuck near the door even though I press the control for him to move forward. Plus the controls on the right hand part of the screen are too close to the controls on the phone, so if your finger moves a but too much other apps are popping open when you don\'t want them to and the game app is closing. Found the jumping upward on level 2 very awkward. Character didn\'t want to move forward during the jumps. So your continuous trying to climb and starting over if you miss a jump.',
       'It\'s an disaster game. It doesn\'t even open on my phone...it just stuck all the time.',
       'So, this game is very exciting, but i have problems with defeating the monsters, and after this "update" nothing changed, so next time make new levels! I MEAN, COME ON !! Other than that, game is great.' ,

      'I love this game so much! I spend every moment of free time playing this. The graphics are awesome, music is nice, controls are also easy to get used to. The only thing is the internet. Yea sure, its for online purchases, but i dont buy anything. Still gonna rate it 5 stars tho, because this game is awesome! Definetly worth downloading.',
       'I think the gameplay is good and the caatle building aspect is fun.  However, the level scaling is way off.  You get a point between throne room 4 and 5 and can\'t do a whole lot.  Losing fights when your characters are maxed out in training.  Other than that its pretty solid.',
       'Why in the f**k does this require an internet connection. Fallout shelter is the same thing but doesn\'t need internet. Sure you can use internet for purchases and rewards but it definitely should not be required. Please consider making this offline compatible and I will change my review to 5 stars and a positive actual review of the game. Thank you.',
       'Definitely worth downloading and trying out.. It\'s just like fallout shelter but a little more. You can do a story line and attack other players rather then just sending people out and HOPING to get something good. It\'s a little slow at first but it\'s really quite alot of fun and the creators actually listen to its players.',
       'Good game but when your rank gets high all of a sudden most enemies are too powerful. Then it takes forever to gear up. Solution is to deliberately lose and lower your rank. Not good. Also you will find yourself with a lot of gear after you played a while. Would be nice to able to sort it, not only for your different warriors but also all the production gear. Would be good to be able to more easily compare gear in your stash and what your inhabitants are wearing. It\'s a bit messy now.',
       'Overall a great game, there\'s one feature though that I feel lets this game down. Just the small fact that a father can copulate with his daughter, then again with their inbred child if you so wish. I currently have 4 generations of inbred mutants running my castle, if anything the extra fingers actually help with certain tasks such as cleaning. Do you happen to have a designer working on this with the surname Fritzl?' ,

       'Game is good but sometimes the level of ads get silly. Answer a phone call in the middle of a game and you have to see an ad, often messing up one shot in the process.  Also game gets hung when displaying ads.  Over all good but needs improvement on stability and toning down ads a bit to earn better rating.' ,

      'The game is fun. However, most times it takes a long time to "reload" from a previous game especially if you\'ve won some chests. often times the next game has already started and some times even missed out in buying cards for it. Also, When you\'ve leveled up, the prompt screen for this lingers for too long as well. Though I\'m not quite sure if it\'s the game or just my phone.',
       'When I was on Facebook a message poped up saying. Congratulations you been chosen to receive 3 free spins. So I took the chance and went for it. I got 3 free spins and I got winner on the 3 spin. How do I now receive the prize money of $3,500? This the amount showing I won.',
       'Would be a great game if the support team actually paid attention to complaints. I have written to them 3 times about my missing crediyd6and have received no response!',
       'I\'ve been playing this game for a while. I\'ve made ZERO progress in the last 4 days. It seems this app forces you to spend money to make progress. Yes, they have their daily bonuses. But almost guaranteed you\'ll lose every time.  Haven\'t made any progress in 4 days. I refuse to spend money on an app that advertises as free. Will find a better app.',
       'it\'s impossible to get bingo and finish the levels. they made it so you can\'t play as a guest AND through fb with different credits balances and levels. I\'ve been playing this game 5 years. Uninstalled today because of that.',
       'I found out about this through AppLike and I enjoy it a lot! It\'s very similar to other bingos I\'ve played before, so I\'m used to it. I really like the gifts and cards that you collect for more daily bonuses; it\'s such a challenge to finally complete a collection, but I\'ve gotten a few done so far. Thanks for a great game!!' ,

      'The original sonic dash is better imo. had a better atmosphere, maps looks better gameplay also better. the original was a masterpiece. also, I don\'t like that they introduce scenes that requires you to tilt your phone. since i played sonic dash i didn\'t expect it to be there. it\'s annoying when you\'re laying down and play the game and you got that scene just ruins the gameplay.',
       'The responsiveness of the controls I  this game make it unplayable... it\'s slightly more responsive than the original sonic dash but it\'s still no where near good enough for such a fast paced game.  I tested this on other devices before I posted this review and it\'s the same on all of them',
       'Way too many advertisements. I actually downloaded this game because subway surfer makes start over everytime you download it but after my next tech upgrade I\'m going back to that, atleast the game not flooded with ads.',
       'Ads are back. I paid for a red ring bundle, which did remove them for a while, but they\'re back. The only reason I made a real purchase was so that I wouldn\'t have ads, so can someone please remove the ads from my account. On another note, I really like this, and nice to see Shadow playable again.',
       'I would give it 5 stars, I made an in app purchase to remove ads, but after the game updated non Sega ads started showing again and it asked me to make another purchase in order to remove the non Sega ads AGAIN... love the game, hate the ads...',
       'The game is great but the ads are so intrusive, immersion-breaking, and so annoying that I\'m giving the game 3 stars. Please, I understand that ads are necessary to make money for a free game but make it so that they are not so persistent that an ad automatically opens after a single run. A shame really, this would be such a great game if this would be fixed.' ,

      'So nearly perfect. I tried several and they all had too many ads... some (others) with startling loud sounds that you couldn\'t turn off! Very upsetting! THIS game, however, has only ONE ad at the start of each game, and allows you to mute the sound "once" for all future ads. It\'s simple to click the ad off before the game commences. *wink* The background is lovely and the graphics are wonderful! So relaxing. The happy little "card dance" animation after each win is nice, as well. Thank You!',
       'I grew up with all I had to do so day long was teach myself how to play Solitaire.  It\'s not like I didn\'t have friends but was bored with the ones I had to play with.  I think the game is very realistic.  And completely challenging.',
       'I\'d really give it a 4.5 - plays smoothly and easily, ads are expected in a free game and these are easily disposed of.  The only downside for me is the "wins" are too frequent - not realistic.',
       'I usually don\'t play games on my phone and this is the first one that I did play electronically (I usually play solitare the " old fashioned " way, lol, with a deck of cards) but I\'ll have to admit that I Iike it much much more than I expected to....I enjoyed playing!',

That being said, out of Many, MANY Other Versions I Tried Out Recently, I like this the most!  What it Would Take To GIVE IT THAT ONE OTHER ‚≠êWOULD BE TO ADD "THE MAGIC WAND" TO THE GAME!  I Miss That Cool, Game Winning Feature. A few more SUPER COOL THEMES Would Also Be Needed... there are some nice backgrounds, but most of them are just plain, solid colors, which to ME is kind of Boring.  One last thing is How SLOW The Auto~Collect Feature runs at the end of a winning game~ Sure, it\'s a matter of a few seconds but why not Pick Up The Pace~ It Seems Like FOREVER When You\'re Sitting There  & Watching, Waiting For The Next Hand To Be Dealt!  Maybe it\'s Just ME!?  HOWEVER,  WHEN I NEED TO PLAY~ WHEN I GOTTA HAVE A FEW GAMES IN ORDER TO CLEAR MY MIND & RELAX... THIS GAME IS WHERE I AM & I\'M THANKFUL THAT I FOUND IT!

      'Graphics were generic until now for x86 devices. Thanks for that update. And that moving data to sd card, it is really appreciable since now a days even 32 gb  not sufficient. Hope other game developers get inspiration from this. And downloading just updated part is also an improvement instead of downloading whole data again. 4 stars because this game just wont allow to play older version once it finds out new version is present.',
       'Best driving and racing game on the net. There is so much you can do, it not just " drive a car on a track and try to win", in this game you can choose your path on the track, perform unbelievable stunts and trick\'s, take out other players and cars.  The game play is absolutely great and the graphics are f***#&@ awesome, the only step to fallow in the graphics is realistic and their close to that now, love the game, the only thing I would change is I would make it easier to get car\'s, now the bikes and car packs instead of having to work really hard to get them or spend a lot of real money, granted the real money goes to development of the graphics and game, I would like to be able to get the car and bike packs a little bit easier. Definitely a winner, ü§©',
       'Asphalt 8 airborne is a very exciting game to play. The addition of bikes is mind blowing. Wish all time limited events could be on mobile data rather than wifi. Thumbs up gameloft for an exciting game. After the recent update of this app it keeps crashing with a pop-up message "unfortunately asphalt 8 has stopped working". Please fix this issue.',
       'They fixed commercial black screen bug. Now i can play normal again. Wish longer time for events and R&D, because of work i dont have enough time to play. Money rewards sucks. You cant buy cheapest part from one 24h event. If you spend real money, you are way above evryone else. Also, slow cars are useless. There must be better way for multiplayer ranking.',
       'As racing games go, this is probably the best. The graphics, sound, gameplay are excellent. Race solo, against friends or the world. The variety of ways to race is big. The selection of cars and now bikes, keeps getting bigger. The only down side is buying something from the shop or on offer. I purchased a special offer and never got it. They got my money, I never got the goods. Trying to get in contact with them is a joke. All replies to my emails were automated responses telling me to do the same thing over and over again.',
       'I lost my 2-3 seasons tickets everyday due to error of "Could not log in into server" and " room is close by server". What are you doing there? This is 3 rd time I am complaing about this. But anyone doesn\'t pay attention. Poor support from your team side. Very care less.' ,

       'Its a really good game. The only thing is, that I wish there was maybe some instructions that appear at the beginning, because I didnt know that you couldnt hit the black lumps etc. Maybe if you add little phrases that say what to do and not to do, then it would be almost perfect.',
       'Great time killer I love everything about it and it is a great game to wake up to. The only down side is that you fall off the ledge and that makes it harder to dodge the black. Everything else is 5 stars so that is what I think about roller coaster.',
       'Its really fun and addictive. Awesome game play and good for passing time. Not always so friendly to my battery and too many adds. Other than those little hick ups I absolutely love it.',
       'This game is amazing! It is addicting and fun to play!! The only thing is that I was hoping for some sort of introduction to the game, to tell me how to play etc. Also, I was hoping to be able to choose what kind of ball i use, the black one is plain and kind of boring. But overall its an amazing game!!',

      'Using galaxy note 8 and the graphics are all skewed. I keep getting docked lives and having to restart  a level because the circle of off to the side of where the difference is. What\'s the point? It would be awesome if I could actually play it.',
       'The idea of the app is very nice, however, I am disappointed in the fact that the app requests to access my calls, contacts, and other data. I fail to see why is that necessary for a simple game like this. Moreover, when I listen to music and play the game, the ads come interrupting my music with their own. When I mute them and press X, the music on my phone stops completely, forcing me to leave the game and start the music again. Again, this is inconvenient for an app which I expected to be very simple.',
       'It seems that the touch is way off on my Galaxy S8, when i touch the differences i get a X, but get O for random spots mid-screen! This would be a great game if i could actually play it!!!',
       'This apps cool but being new to Samsung being a former apple person. I\'m not understanding why the games want to access your private things..calls pics etc?',
       'Fun game to use your brain. I really like that you don\'t have to buy hints!  Don\'t really like the background music, but that\'s nothing major.',
       'I like the fact that I\'m not racing against a clock so I can relax and enjoy til I run out of lives. Nice!' ,

      'This game is ok. The graphics are good. It\'s my favourite bowling game out there.  However I really don\'t know why this needs access to my phone contacts and other permissions.  As a result it\'s been removed. Apps and games need to sort out their permissions for what it needs to do. If it\'s not required I\'m not installing it. Other than that complaint it\'s actually a nice game for a quick 5 minute time waster.',

Also i dont like having to pay to get the thinks and to many thinks are whach a vidio to get the thinks it takes to long so i dont l0play it that often. I hope u understand what I\'m going through please fix the game up a bit üòÑ',
       'What a nice game coco made, love the pair mode. Amazing ice skating moves too. But what i don\'t see from the app picture is the holiday (Christmas) items in the game? Other than that, make more gamez of this...üòÑüòâüëçüëåüíô',
       'One thing I want you to add is more out fits for the boys/partner they have way too little clothes to choose from pls add more,and also I want to be able to change the partners hair so we can costomize it the way we want.  But if you want the game get the game it is amazing.  That\'s all bye',
       'Very dissatisfied... I unlocked almost everything I could through watching videos yesterday, and I open the game today and NOTHING is unlocked! So EVERY time you close the game you have to start over? No thanks! Good bye! YOU SUCK with your ad ridden games! Will not be downloading another of yours!',
       'Ok lmy phone then I fell asleep guess what they did they put the game a start over then what!!! Nope I ilwill not play one of games I will play Roblox and Roblox good fame but I still have cocoa and the point is that I can\'t delete it bye bye Coco',
       'This is clearly a game for young girls around 9-13 years of age. What money will the developer make from 9-13 year olds with no job? Nothing, hence the ads! Makes sence to me! The game play is good for this age group. If you find it boring then you are probably too old for this game.' ,

      'This game is dope I play it all the time! Alot of ads but I may just pay the 3 bucks to remove them. Only thing I would request is maybe an option to view the race stats at the end of each race. to see who we raced and their times rather than just a quick glance. So say I beat a high ranked player I\'d like something to show for it. Besides that I love this game!',
       'This game was worth 5 stars until the updates... More than half the time i try to connect to a race its doesn\'t work and doesn\'t give me back the 20 energy it requires to race. Also, I watched 50 videos to get the new car BLADE and i received absolutely NOTHING!!!! Until they fix this issue its getting a 1 star from me.',
       'So first of all way too many ads... When you click race you get Frozen and then sent to home screen and you lose your fuel... When you\'re "waiting on players" and they don\'t show up you lose fuel.. out of 10 attempts to start a race I play one',
       'I really like this game when it actually lets you play it. It has so many connection issues that most the time it wont let you race it just takes your fuel and kicks you back to the main screen. Very frustrating',
       'Awesome game! Play it everyday. Even have spent actual money on it. That goes a long way for me.  Although, it\'s sucks after the latest update. Can\'t even go 12 races before it freezes up entering races and during races as well. Thats when i go to a different game. It\'s too bad.',
       'I enjoy the game. My only concern is the regular bombing out of the game just before a race. It\'s irritating. And you end up losing energy as if one actually raced. Just fix it then I would be able to turn a blind eye to the constant adverts. I know you need to be paid too.' ,

      'Great game if you wanna run low graphics for a smoother gameplay on your phone. 40 instead of 100 is great for mobile games as well. Maybe make the controls a tad bit larger for default size. Otherwise really fun. Maybe add a first person mode? Unless I haven\'t found out how to haha. Great game. I seemed to like this one out of all the others tbh.',
       'Well I love the potential. Has a lot of bugs. Dual or quad mode doesn\'t work and overall it takes too long to wait. I waited 10 minutes for quad and then it just stopped and put me back to choosing game modes. I think thi s game can be the best if it had more work put into it.',
       'I honestly liked the game better before the update. You got rid of the aim button, the game is full of glitches like taking damage inside the safe zone, and I get lagged out all the time even though I have a pretty good Wi-Fi connection. To be honest,  you kinda ruined the game.',
       'This game is good and very challenging but i dont like the new update. My overall Stats have stopped working and im still dyeing even when im in circle and the aim button needs to come back it is so hard to play without it.  But overall a good game it just needs a few adjustments.',
       'Good game, but after the last update the game game is riddled with bugs and glitches, making the game next to unplayable. Will often come up with queue error and kick me from the game and the screen constantly freezes. I can move, but I can\'t pick anything up and my teammate position is also frozen. Pls fix or I will uninstall. Also, you got rid of the aim button which sucks. Was way better before the update. You\'ve ruined the game for meüò≠üò≠üò≠',
       'Love this game. Its so addictive. Just a few things needs to be added ; like new outfits, new vehicles in game and please add a voice chat. Its really difficult to communicate with teammates when playing. Everything else is perfect. Still deserves a rating of 5.' ,

       'I like this new update. Hanks now have His own happy meter like Tom and Angela. Nice. Also this is just my suggestion. Can you guys also make My Talking Ben and My Talking Ginger. Those two deserved their own My Talking games. Also can you guys add more money to Tom cause He always have just one big gold coin and that\'s it. You know Angela have plenty of gold coin even Hanks have three. It\'s not fair. Lastly good job guys.',

      'Amazing game. Me and my friend spend hours on it. I get to shows him my mods. He has none though we both have completed the levels. The game NEVER AND I REPEAT NEVER gets boring. Definitely better than the angry birds series must download. The only problome is the metal flap things don\'t work correctly. They just float in midair.Apart from that  Please make a new selection of levels. My life depends on it!!!!',
       'The game and level desgins promote and foster a great degree of creastive thinking. With very unique mechanics and obstacles that actually require thought and consideration when building. It has great art, along with many bonus levels and content. Fun game overall but level experiences do wildly vary sometimes. From simple to extremely  difficult, sometimes you win by mer luck and not strategy. Along with all that I don\'t know if anyone else experienced this but the levers on lvl6 were buggy and never worked. All in all good game to play.',
       'FIX THE ROAD TO EL PORKADO I swear this is frustrating to the point of unplayable. No, those levels ARE unplayable. They cannot be done with this platform glitch at all. Also, sometimes in sandbox mode when I click the tick it disappears when it hits the ground. Occasional and not as game breaking or frustrating as the moving platforms not working but still',
       'I would give it a higher rating, but on those levels like 6-18. The button activated doors and platforms don\'t work right and they glitch out. I\'ve been able to get through a few levels without the doors but on 6-18 you can\'t complete the level without this door working. Please get this fixed',
       'Very disappointed that I\'ve had no response to my email and that there is no sign of a fix to the bug with El Porkado, rendering the levels uncompletable. Wouldn\'t be so bad if you didn\'t have some of my actual money!',
       'The game is really good but the bridge bug is annoying. I got stuck on a level and tried to reinstall the app but it did not work. It is so annoying that a really good game like this has a bug that prevents you from finishing the game. Oh and also, what is different about the HD version? It seems to be the exacted same.' ,

       'There is a huge delay from when you hit the key to when you hear the key and too many ads. I was trying to find something good to get down song ideas so I wasn\'t the intended consumer and I can see how this could he good for learning, but you could get the same thing off youtube and not have the excessive ads.',
       'It\'s pretty good, and good enough to warm up my voice and practice before singing at my church, and when I\'m bored I just play the songs that comes with the app. And it\'s also handy for when I don\'t have my bass guitar at hand and trying figure out song notes and chords, this is pretty useful. I like it.',
       'It didn\'t work. (Desclaimer: NO HATE, JUST BUGS AND STUFF THAT DIDN\'T WORK)  Very laggy and so many glitches,  I\'m just stating the cons, no hate. It just didn\'t work for me and when I tried to record, it got all glitchy and recorded multiple at a time. I tried to press keys but it wasn\'t picking anything up. After a while, all the keys I pressed came into a big bundle and sometimes, it randomly recorded for no reason. Again, no hate. I just found a lot of bugs, which I would be happy to play this piano with, if the developers fixed it. I couldn\'t move the keyboard as well. I tried to drag it to a different spot, but no avail. Just a couple of things that didn\'t work for me, like how it wasn\'t timed when I pressed a certain button. (NO HATE)',
       'If you take synthesia tutorials and apply them to this app, you might just be able to play any song! I can\'t say I love this app but I really like it. .... I change my mind, I do love this app! Glad I chose this one ‚ô° (watch for adds though)',
       'The ads are literally infuriating, if I let my phone lock it\'ll open with another freakin ad. Then when I\'m trying to play I\'ll accidentally click on an ad and it\'ll redirect me. I\'M JUST TRYING TO PRACTICE. This app used to be good but now it\'s riddled with ads like a virus. Do NOT get this app.' ,

      'If you like doing mazes, then I highly recommend this game. It\'s by far the best maze game app I\'ve come across! Not only is it addicting, but it is fun and more challenging/authentic then any other maze games I\'ve tried. There are plenty of levels/modes to keep you entertained. It\'s the only maze puzzle app I\'ve found worth playing! üòÄüíú',
       'Time killer. B&W colors are a bit hard on the eyes after awhile. I wish the controls weren\'t so touchy. Even if I\'m using my stylus it\'s easy to move into a wrong corner by accident when you know it\'s not the right direction.',
       'I\'m not far into it, but it\'s fun so far. My eyesight could be why it\'s not a 5-star experience. The more complex levels are very small and give me a headache after a couple of mazes. I believe the contrast and color schemes could be improved and make the game better. It\'s still a very good game though.',
       'I love mazes and this game keeps me on my toes. Even though I haven\'t played it too long, an adult ad popped up that I felt was inappropriate. This concerns me because my 7yo daughter is also fond of mazes. Now I\'ll have to download a separate kid version for her.',
       '5 stars, the game does exactly what it should do, and the controls are simple and intuitive, but please, can you add a feature to prevent the screen from turning off? It messes a little when I try to mentally solve the classic mazes',
       'Where is the challenge? This game is as lame as the rest of the maze games. If you would  try make the game more challenging then maybe I would not have deleted it.' ,

I love this game and so will you. And the different animals.',
       'This used to be my favourite game as some other people said but now you have to pay real money it\'s the worse.i once had Ariel and I updated it and the game wanted me to pay money for a couple of the ones I all ready had.it was a good game until you had to pay money.you will not get a penny out of me alot of other people thought the same keep that in mind. I don\'t want to sound mean or anything like that.if you thought I was being mean I\'m so so sorry.',
       'You guys are greedy pigs. How could you make over half of the animals cost real money. Just make a new game and leave the good ones alone. This used to be my favorite game now it\'s my least you won\'t get a cent out of me. And you\'re probably thinking one unsatisfied person doesn\'t matter but it does.',

       'Although the game is really  good in every aspect, but when it comes to limited time events  i have to play day and night to win a car. It really gives you a bad effect on mind which ruins the fun of playing the game. They should be made a little easy which keeps the fun of playing. After the new update there is a problem. Whenever i see an advertisement to reduce waiting time for tickets, the time won\'t reduce and this happens like 10 to 20 times in a day.',
       'The game starts off good in the first couple levels. But once you start getting to the faster cars, it becomes way harder to keep up with the cars PR points, to get to better races. Unless you spend real money to get the parts. One question I do have. Is about the blackridge rivals. Why put some one with a car at a way higher level against a person who\'s car isn\'t even close to the car at a high level, and one more thing... make the races longer. 20 seconds a race isn\'t fun at all. Thinking with the name "Need For Speed". You guys would of done a lot better. The only thing that I seem to like are the  graphics... But that\'s about it...',
       'Goog game, adddictive infact. But I don\'t understand the concept of PATANJALI adds. Whenever i choose to see adds to reduce the waiting time, you comeup with Patanjali adds of 10 and 20 seconds and the irritating part is the time doesn\'t gets reduced even after watching the whole add. Please fix this. When you say reduce wait time by watching add, you need to actually reduce the waiting time after the add instead of insisting to watch the add again and again.',
       'When I started playing this game I really enjoyed it. But now I realise that in order to progress, you MUST spend REAL money. I am a family man, with a wife and 6 children, I just wanted a game that I could play when kids are in bed and wife is in bath, I don\'t have cash to spend on games, the worst thing is the 7 Day events, you cannot beat them without spending money. Very disappointed. Good game but don\'t expect to progress very far if you don\'t want to spend money.',
       'The 50m downloads speak for themselves. ThIs game is SICK!!! It\'s really fun, it\'s easy to play, it\'s addicting, and so far the progression in the game is a good pace and you can progress without spending any money. There\'s no ad\'s, the graphics are AMAZING, and it\'s an all around great game. The only weird thing is that when I\'m connected to any Bluetooth device the sounds are messed up, I\'m playing on a Note 8 so it can\'t be my phone, but that\'s not at all a problem for me. Races are kinda short but I\'m cool with that too. By far one of the best games I\'ve ever played on my phone.' ,

      'Game is fun until you get so far and can no longer upgrade to compete.  I have all stars in amateur league, yet on achievement rewards it shows I only have 1 star.  This is a problem to try to earn stars to purchase higher end cars, you can\'t without spending money.  Should be anle to earn all cars if you play regularly withput spending money.',
       'First up the images used as what the game looks like are fakes. I saw too many polygons.... (Shudder) Secondly there is no start menu. NOPE! Just some fancy loading screen and boom you\'re in the game without a chance to look at the controls. Plus your first mission is ruined by the tutorial at the worst places on the track.   Bad game knockoff. If you download this just delete it. This game is EXPLICATIVE',
       'Good time waster. Especially well made in the beginning levels, but quickly becomes pay to win, as diamonds are not easily attainable and neither are coins, not to mention that later cars are very high prices and require much dedication to acquire. Controls are nice, but like with money, get worse with time. Maps are not optimized for later leveled cars, making some corners physically impossible to make even when drifting at full tilt, forcing the player to adapt to a combination of drifting, boosting and then braking to get around a bend without crashing. Otherwise, it is a very nice game for being free, although there are many ads, but that\'s excusable as it is a free game. I would recommend it, just not as a long term type of game.',
       'Nice game at first, my gf got angry at some point because I played it the whole time. However, I soon started playing less and less, because winning just became impossible. I respect the developers, but I wont pay to max out a cars modifications just to race that same car which is twice as fast. How does that work? Are the AI cars getting modifications from a different game?',
       'So many ad\'s, there back to back ad\'s. When I am finally able to select a race, guess what...another ad pops up and takes me to the play store to download it. I go back to the game and I gotta start all over again from the first screen. Ad\'s ad\'s ad\'s I was only able to play on the first day I downloaded it, after that..... Ad\'s ad\'s ad\'s                    "AD\'S!!!".... But i did like the game when I played it',
       'I one stared it because it has good graphics and what not but the only problem is this is a complete knock off of "Asphalt 8" features and everything. I\'d say it\'s so much alike I\'d call it plagiarizing but that\'s just my opinion.  Good game overall but no respect for not being something differebt in a better way .' ,

      'After a week of play , I am getting to attack smaller cities , KILL KILL,  grate time filler,  some sexier clothing options for the (ladies) would be nice,  lots to do and manage, clans mates are important, so chose wisely. I am enjoying this immensely.  Edit after (time seems like forever,)  I am really enjoying this,  Negotiated a couple of Peace Treaties, built my crew and strength, I am getting to be a force to reckon with... But there are still bigger fish, frustrating  Would love a feature to hunt the attacker, but then that would backfire too,   Great game...lots of challenges and opportunities for growth,  Highly recommended   *****',
       'It\'s your standard "GOW" clone with a Godfather ripoff motif.  You know the formula: spend money, build fast, get stomped by the kiddies with access to daddy\'s credit card who spend thousands of $$$.    Guaranteed to trigger the easily offended due to scantily clad women.  Hilariously bad "Engrish" text throughout the game.    Just get your currency for whatever other game it is you play as fast as possible and move on.',
       'So many players have reported on one player that keep spamming the city.  Just because he cant take it when his city got burned .  Check ur report n banned him from playing. Or many others player will start quitting.',
       'I think this could possibly be the worst game for GM support ever. If you need help after paying, Don\'t worry someone with broken English will appear, answer a different question then leave. Mind blowingly stupid.',
       'Nice game. I just thought that the Babe game part should be a bit more easier and less difficult coz its hard to score the chicks when your way up to level 11 and getting to the yatch. But the rest of the gameplay is fun and challenging. Overall... its a Good Fun Game. Awesome.',
       'Newbie dont play this game. It\'s was fun at first then you follow the instructions as normal. But at the end of the day you will get stuck and you will run out of supplies.. Their idea is to make you buy.' ,

       'Personally I think the stories are a bit cheesy and there\'s very limited interactivity. Some of the stories I played had no interactivity at all. You have to pay to see photos or videos in the game, which is fair enough, but I wish the game had a set price or charged a small amount for each story. A weekly subscription fee is  too much for me. There is a free 3 day trial though.',

      'Game is really tooo gud, graphics also nice n smooth controls but u guys released only one game mode(Team death match), but in lot of fps games they provided free for all, bomb mode, Flag capture n many more modes.. If u guys also provide  like that then ur game gonna be top in fps games üòÄ n mainly  not much places only 3-4... try to add more places n increase the area Size for more fun n more Dodge , now game look like playing in a pocket u guys need to increase area.',
       'I love the game. the game play itself is very self explanatory, quick and very good fps however, they have scammed me. I spent 12.99 on gbucks, the purchase was confirmed, and right after they asked me if i had liked to submit another card number for another purchase. I recall having credentials on a different prepaid visa card in my notes, so I go look, unfortunately I didn\'t have the CVS code for it. I go back to the game, it had reloaded but I didn\'t get my gbucks. I was a little confused as the purchase had been confirmed, and the money was taken off my card. I tried contacting them 3 separate times about it but obviously they aren\'t vigilant of their customers and don\'t take them as a priority. I recommend playing the game but avoid spending money on it. If I could get some help and get a refund on my card, or the gbucks I originally paid for, I will give it 5 stars, as I would like to.',
       'The best shooting game ever. Lobed each and every single thing about this game but there a little suggestion that we can see the player if they are online or not but how is this if we can see there live going on matches? That concept will be great and games lag sometimes so if you can fix this and add my suggestion in guns of boom that will be hell great!! #the best game',
       'Great game with a lot of potential.... There can be so many more additions to make this fps better. More grenade varieties? A spectator mode? Clan levels that allow more players to join when we reacher higher levels? Gun balancing changes? I feel like the Cerberus should be buffed. It is expensive, and the 3 shots at once doesn\'t allow for many attempts for kills. Adventure mode for more gunbucks? Death match option? Allowing us to pick the map? I understand the game is fairly new, so keep on adding changes and new improvements. Thanks for listening!',
       'I was loving it and have spent alot of money but this update made it to where i can\'t even open it back up. Please fix because i loved this game and have invested time and money and if i don\'t get to play it anymore sometime soon I\'m not coming today back. Please fix very soon i was trying earn a special gun but I\'m not sure if that\'ll be an option if an when it gets fixed',
       'After level 30 the game is pay to win and after that level at least 90% of the battles the teams are unbalance. Pay vs free to play player. It is like if you don\'t use real money the game is punishing you with a handicap. Your armor and gun become less effective. If you are not planning to spend money on this game do NOT waste ur time. üëé' ,

      'The movement and the ability to delete structures for refund could be better. Trading HQ could be so much better, my main concern are the loading screens. Perhaps instead of loading the whole city a separate map viewer could be opened that shows general statistics and layout but not the entire city. That way trading could be done faster between cities and there would be more involvement with the trading community. As it stands its a real chore and is deterring me from trading as much as I\'d like. Another idea is if the stock market could be integrated somehow. I think that would be cool, and it would add an element of realism.',
       'Addictive & fun.  In a perfect world: more land expansion is needed. Also, variable prices at the GTHC based on scarcity would be better than fixed ones based on difficulty to produce.  One important thing.  There is premium currency in this game.  It\'s very easy to accidentally spent it, as there is no confirm button on premium currency purchases.  Fix this and will give 5-stars again',
       'The more stuff is added the lagier it gets. Game freezes when buying items, when going over your city, with the chat, loading the flobsl trade, travelling to other cities and basicly everything nowadays. Requires multiple restarts of the game and reboots of my phone regularly to keep jt playable nowadays. It used to be really good and smooth, but it only gets worse each update and no improvement in sight. I only play now because I made some good friends in my club, but the actual fun is long gone. :(',
       'i like the quests to earn gold keys & platinum keys. other players can see what is in my storage & i hope EA can block/fix that. there are still video ad problems; a video will either play or not; and it will not return me to game; and/or it will not offer the three choices. 02/20/2018. how many times do i have to rate game?',
       'I absolutely love this game. I play it all throughout the day. I\'ve made really good friends with the people in my club, and we are all over the somewhat new "club wars" feature. There was a lag, but it was recently fixed. There\'s always something to do in this game, and you can play at your own pace. You don\'t have to spend real money to play the game, but I\'ll admit that I spend a dollar every now and then for the 30 days of green buck income. I love this game so much that I\'ve even started a second city on another device with my other email.',

I like that can change the min length of a word. And you can choose the difficulty. And the max word length brilliant the only thing I would say. Is can you put more choices of colours for background colours. And list colours. Also button colours',

      'Game is very pleasant to look at, but it is basically a platform to watch advertisements on. And after a certain point, watching the advertisements don\'t offset the cost of opening your eggs. Smooth gameplay. Adorable graphics. But you\'ll be lucky to get maybe 10 minutes of gameplay per session before you have to wait. Not too bad if you only have a few minutes to play at a time, but not for me.',
       'The latest update deleted my save, and when I reloaded the one saved on the cloud, it only had my progress up to before Jurassic Island. Losing my stuff kind of took away the fun in playing for me, so I\'m uninstalling. It\'s too bad, I\'ve been enjoying the game for months.',
       'This game is kinda fun. I enjoy it, in an odd way it\'s satisfying. I recommended getting it if you\'re bored, or looking for a time killer. The controls are easy, and so far I\'ve had no ads. Also the eggs don\'t take that long to hatch. At least not yet I just started playing',
       'Just super cute time waster lots of adds but you find super cute things and I Love claw games so we\'re Good! I keep wining the super size 2x  your eggs but for some reason I can\'t get the ability to do that even though it says I won 3 times?',
       'Was a good pass time until the last update. For whatever reason, 2 eggs have been sitting hatched, however, when I click them they never open. They just continue bouncing up and down. Frustrating because now I can only hatch one egg at a time...',
       'I think this game is really fun and cute. I just wish you can get diamonds more often cuz I haven\'t been playing for very long but I don\'t have enough time to buy another slot and it\'s hard to get diamonds so I like the game but they need  to make it easier to get diamonds. Love the game over all I give it five stars' ,

      'I love this game but you can\'t open chest or crafting table or stove. About the houses: it\'s really fun and easy to build the houses. And also it\'s one of the best and exiting Minecraft game ever!!! But like I said you can\'t open anythingüòë But other than that in love it can you please fix the changes that I want if you can please!! Thank you!!üòä',
       'At first the game was great but then there were a few things that need to be added. First of all, you can\'t crouch, second of all,it doesn\'t have texture packs, and make the graphics like the real version of momentary. If you add these, I will give you 5 stars.',
       'DO NOT WASTE YOUR DATA ON THIS PIECE OF TRASH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!impossible to see at night due  to ads. ever walk around outside after midnight with a flashlight in your hand pointed at your face? well the ads make it hard as hell to see at night. i have started this game six times and cannot see anything happenning at night. and that is too big of a flaw for me tocontinue to use a game. paid 7 bucks and downloading the real minecraft right now. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME!!!!!!',
       'I downloaded this game and the very next morning my phone got hacked. I\'m not saying it was definitely related to the game softwares but I have no way of knowing, so I will not be installing this again. Also its clearly a straight theft of  Minecraft with only some textues and sounds changes. Blatant copy write theft.',
       'OMG THIS GAME IS EPIC!!!!!!!!! I have 1 question, there are these holes in the ground  (in creater mode) and the holes have iron and sapphires but I\'m scared 2 go in. What are they and is it 100% safe 2 go in the tunnels? At the moment, I just block them up. Plz tell me! Oh and I LOVE the fact that the game saves on its own!!!!!',
       'CAN SOMEONE PLEASE CONTACT ME IN ANY WAY OR POST HOW TO MAKE A NETHER PORTAL!?!?!?!!?!? I\'m desperate!! My instagram is _t4nh4_   please message me how to make one or comment it here or MESSAGE ME ON EMAIL ..... Any way works! Please save meeee!!! :((' ,

      'A really nice game which also got me hooked up! Nevertheles, it frequently and automatically shuts down, deleting what was there.....this really broke my litlle sister\'s heart, even mine. For we were working on one for a long time and after one of thise repetitive ads, the app shut down.....',
       'Its the BEST game I EVER played! Also, when I was 4, we didnt unlock anything. Now I am 17 and we have every thing for free! I love glitchs. Dont try to fix them though!  I love them and u sould 2. Peace out!',
       'I actually had this game a long time ago but have not rate this yet. At first all the colours were not unlocked yet so i was pretty disappointed. After a while everthing was unlocked so i was super excited. It doesn\'t get me board everytime i have different desins to do.',
       'I  am finally at the final last level! Before I thought it was boring but after I reached some levels farther I thought it was awesome! And it is the best game ever! YEAH!!!!!!!!üòòüòòüòòüòòüòòüòòüòòüòòüòòüíôüíôüíöüíöüíõüíõüíúüíúüíóüíó‚ù§‚ù§ AND when I was playing my 1st game all things were opened but when I played in my small sister\'s tab all, things were closed! I got everything for free!! HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA',
       'I love this app!! I had it since I was just 5!  It is a lovely game So what are YOU waiting for ? DOWNLOAD THIS APP I üíü it I AM 12 Playback download this app thank you üòÉüòÉ Imam I  addicted to the app I willüíüto meet whoever invented this Good day',
       'Buyer beware, I purchased the "unlock all manicures" option less than a year ago, not only to unlock options but also to remove Ads for my kids. It\'s less than a year later, and ads are back, with an option to remove them for another fee. When paying just about 8 bucks less than a year ago, I find this distasteful. At least give a full year of ad free gameplay. Not impressed.' ,

      'It is a good clicker game kinda like clicker heroes but with a lot better graphics, the controls are simple and the only thing I dislike about in the slightest way is that the heroes are a little bit to expensive, it has a simple but very cool design and deserves 5 stars. Thankfully it doesn\'t cost money to buy the game itself. All in all it is a great game.',
       'Great game still playing after 2 years and for people who ask what does prestige mean is that it gives you relics which are used to better you character with artifacts, but i come with a price... starting over with a slight headstart.',
       'was fun until the game stopped loading and I was forced to uninstall. thanks a f***ing lot too signed up with my email and it told me that my account is no longer valid. good game. ya d***heads.',
       'Pretty much fixes all my gripes with other rpg idle games, plus it looks really good. 1 day in, and I feel like even though I\'ve made a lot of progress, I still have more to discover. It\'s rare that an incremental like this actually captures that feeling. It\'s what makes me want to continue grinding.',
       'It\'s amazing, easy ,all you have to do is tap and upgrade your character and your allies and while your away and off your phone your allies could take down the titans for you. Super fun and addicting.',
       'Tried for a few minutes, then uninstalled. All I had to do is tap to kill the monsters, they don\'t even fight back. At lvl 2 or 3, I got a companion who auto attacked. Then I didn\'t even have to tap anymore. The monsters just died while I watched.  I don\'t understand why everyone is giving this 5 stars. Maybe some joke that the whole world gets except for me. Oh well.' ,

      'LOVE this game!! Literally, I don\'t think I can explain it. Just play it, and see for yourself :D    If you like figuring stuff & puzzles out, this is totally for you! And also, it\'s just so satisfying to watch. I personally play lots of the puzzles over & over again, just to see the graphics, how all the objects fly and move üòú',
       'A good sign of high intelligence would be to not pay for this.   On a tablet with a pen,  this probably works a little better but on a phone with 1 minute ads,   it\'s really frustrating.   Basically,  you find a solution and have to repeat it 30 times until the dull and unrealistic physics of this program finally accept it.',
       'This game apparently needs more graphics power than my tablet has. Every time i start to draw, there is a two to three second delay before the line starts moving. The game will lock up momentarily, then skip to where i am in the drawing, leaving out large sections of my solution. And of course, when the game skips ahead, the timer does too. Not a good thing to have happen in a game where every tenth of a second matters.',
       'I introduced this game to my 8 year old and my husband. We are all hooked! I am fascinated by the concept and simple yet brilliant design. The forced 30 second ads that another reviewer mentioned are only if you want a hint. The between-round ads are short and intermittent.',
       'this game is so simple but yet so challenging. some levels seem impossible but the great thing is you can still advance as long as you have enough points. very well done. hats off to the designer. the physics are coded perfect as well for gravity friction inertia and sometimes extra bounce..  love it. can only handle it in bursts of play because it works your brain so intensely. havent used the hints either though. if you dont keep coming back to play this then you probably arent a very interesting person and spend too much time diddling your privates',
       'The game is addictive. Mediocre ratings are because there is a bug. On all games on all levels I\'m getting a network error and I\'m not connected to a network viewing a hint. I have been connected to numerous networks and reset the phone. This needs to be sorted.' ,

      'Great game for its genre. However it desperately needs some events maybe a daily login bonus and some form of vip ladder. I like the nostalgic of the old game but I feel like the developers made the game and just walked away from it. Please for love of games add new stuff and throw some events to us who are almost maxed out. This happens and I\'m totally cool with a 5 star rating',
       'Best game in years and I especially love the character jam and there are many more for you to collect they are worth the get even when your scroundging around for the last few characters. Also it\'s crazy how much they throw at you for watching an ad It can give you 20 diamonds to 8 hours of cash it\'s insane',
       'Pretty fun. But I don\'t think drivers or taxi drivers should drive like that, let alone be rewarded for hitting other cars like they do... Lol in the car it\'s cool but I wouldn\'t want to be physically in the game. It\'d hurt and be scary. Lol',
       'I was playing a game when this ad came up with a fake X so that it would take you to the play store. I hate shady practices like this so I installed it just so I can give you this review. Enjoy your single freak\'n star!  PS This is not a review of the game itself and I could care less at this point. This review is on this games advertisment tactics.',
       'Fun game, cool animations and graphics. Good music and sound effects. Can you help with diamonds and sell out features just a tad bit more. I enjoy the game. Awesome job developers and programmers. Nice twist on the classic crazy taxi game',
       'It\'s a cool game. Nice to be able to be in charge of the classic Crazy Taxi Crew along with a bunch of new friends to help take down an evil corporation.  However, I haven\'t been able to receive the 1 Day Boost bonuses from the blimps I pop. This has happened 3 times where I watch an ad, then not receive the bonus boost after I\'m done.' ,

      'I love this game but I found a bug, I don\'t know how exactly it happened but I was doing an extra task (a clown factory dice making one) I used auto clicker and was just holding one finder down and tapping to sell with the other. Now all of my factories have a die on each person\'s desk and it doesn\'t go away once sold. Other then that, great game and nice timewaster. :D',
       'It\'s fun building up stuff and I like how the game keeps playing even when closed.   One thing that annoys me, I try to watch the ads for free in game currencey, but most of the time either the ad crashes or the game is reset when I close the ad and I don\'t receive in-game currencey. Probably my potato Moto G5 doesn\'t have enough RAM. Another fingersoft game, HCR2 has the same concept and doesn\'t have this problem.',
       'The only thing I don\'t like about this app is the controls. You can\'t hold your finger to make production faster. You have to tap constantly. But other wise, it was a great app and I recommend it\'s',
       'I somewhat enjoyed this time wasting game until one of the characters (robots) I purchased for millions of coins just left, and sent me a picture to share with friends.  From there I had to spend another million coins to buy a human who had less skill.   Not worth playing a game that takes your hand earned characters away for no reason.',
       'It\'s a great time killer if you are waiting or have nothing to do. It does get boring after 3 and a half hours,but it\'s still good. Also way less and I mean way less ads than other games. Excuse my spelling and grammar, but you know what it means. (It\'s good)',
       'Absolutely love this game. Becoming addicticed already, had this game for 4 days and I love the tapping where if you use more than 1 finger it goes faster. So my family thinks I\'m crazy sitting there with my hand tapping the screen so fast, they even said "slow down there matey you\'ll break your screen of you keep going like that" long story short, now I have a cracked screen but vwry am addicted. Great game fingersoft keep up the good work' ,

      'All you do is watch ads. Start the game, you get an ad. Play one round (rounds last about 30 seconds), watch an ad. Play two rounds, watch an ad. Want to double your earnings from last round? Watch an ad. Play a round. Game crashes. Open the game. Watch an ad. The game itself would be ok but the constant bombardment of ads is just too much. Literally half of the time spent in the game is just watching ads.',
       'Simple mechanics. A bit TOO simple. You can only equip each turret ONCE. So if you want to try different combinations, you\'re SEVERELY limited. The order in which you equip them matters very little since the rockets are random. There is very little player input. Equip. Press play. Sit back. Has potential but is just a simple time waster as is. DO NOT put any money into this. I don\'t even know how to make games but could probably do better than this within a few days of practice. Right now, it\'s just an ad machine. Ads.... Ads everywhere....',
       'The amount of ads in this game is preposterous and it asks for permissions it doesn\'t need - including the ability to make phone calls. Many of this developers apps do the same so I\'m pretty sure they\'re spyware.',
       'When I play I have my Wi-Fi on for multiplier please turn off Ad\'s! from turning on every time I enter the level and die( it\'s enough for me to watch Ad\'s  to get bonus credit please turn them off for free it slows down very badly my speed of progress! Only rated the best! "For you guys to remove AD\'S...',
       'Can\'t disable or lower sound in game. Seems like such a basic mechanism to be missing. Overall feels incomplete, with an unbalanced economy based on advertisements with no real progression coming from play time. Decent concept, poorly executed.',
       'There seem to be way more ads than in earlier versions. it\'s getting a little ridiculous, especially early on where a round might only last a minute or two with a 30 second ad between each round.' ,

      'This app is nice. One thing I like about this app is it takes only one single unit to give a random letter hint because I have seen in many apps that they take 60 or 90 coins or whatever unit to just show a letter and this app haves daily bonus 30 coins so I love this app but I think that the app members should give a little attention on the animation because it is not so clear. Besides this all all the best for the team of this app and make good apps further.',
       'Not a bad game, but would be great if you could simply type the name down, instead of slowly searching for each individual letter. Makes it all sluggish and takes away the fluidity of the game.',
       'Several times now I\'ve tried to type in a logo name and the app has told me I got it wrong but I thought it was right and couldn\'t see why I was being told I was wrong. So I hit "solve" and the answer is exactly what I typed in.  I have also had a few times now where I\'ve recognised the logo but there are letters missing when I try to type in the name.  I had what I suspect to be this app deferral years ago and had no problems with it at all but since this new look and expanded number of logos has appeared it feels like you\'ve ruined a fun app. Any chance of fixing this screw up?',
       'First Level at Barbie and Twitter, even if type the words correct, the app tells me that there\'s a mistake. Solve shows me exactly the same word I\'ve typed in before',
       'Several times I have tried to use a hint and it  wouldn\'t take it off and it was difficult and easy. When I type in the logo it would tell me I\'m wrong then I hit solve and it was the same thing I wrote also and if people don\'t know some of the logos what is the point of the game.',

      'I hate it! There is only three looks to do, and the make up! Literally you have to click on it a thousand times until you get the one you like. The cloths aren\'t that bad, but they can be a little more pretty. They should make it for boys and girls, so you can dress up boys, and maybe the boys can take a girl on a date so, they could get married and then they can have children but, it would be a life cycle! They would start out as babies and grow on and get married!!! Hope you like my feedback!! P.S. Plz update the game!!!',

      'I think it\'s a very fun game. But only thing I would like to see is maybe a market where you could put up duplicates for a price rather than having to trade with 25 million people just to find someone who is willing to buy. It kinda gets annoying when you\'re trying to sell some duplicates and all you find are cheap people who waste time. Also, there should be more packs being released because of how many cards there are. It\'s just too hard to find a card you\'re looking for, through trading. Secondly, if the market idea doesn\'t work there should be an option in which you can talk with the trader and/or be able to set a price of the duplicate you\'re trying to sell rather than wait for people to make unreasonable offers.',

       'It\'s a great game and a virtual version of fifa 18. You will enjoy it as you are guaranteed good players. It\'s not just about the draft you can open packs and trade duplicates.',

       'Would have been 5 but there isn\'t any news about DBC for android and regular lightening rounds have not happened. Plus an open all packs button would be helpful.' ,

      'I think this game is amazing! And is perfectly good in every way!! I can\'t stop playing and look forward to getting new cars. There is just one tiny error that bugs me a bit but I can cope with it. The error is the color of the Ford fiesta xr2. When you race someone else and they have this vehicle on the card the car is black with a tiny red trim on the side but when it\'s on the track it is completely red. I do hope you can will fix this small mistake but apart from that this game is great!!! Thanks for reading :)',
       'First download crashed and wouldn\'t load. Had to reinstall the game and Hutch games couldn\'t recover my profile so had to start again from scratch. I\'ve played through several updates and fixes but the same issues remain, car X beats car y when it shouldnt. Hutch in game support agree there is a problem and send to devs but nothing gets fixed. The whole game seems flawed. To be competitive to you will have to spend about ¬£50 a month. I enjoy the premise but the game is poorly executed.',
       'Game is great. And like every game had it\'s pro\'s and con\'s. To sum this game up in short it is Top Trumps with the race.   Pros: game is different to all the rest out there, car list is really well thought out as well.  Cons the only things I have to say is, it\'s so hard to win decent cars sometimes. Seems quite a pay to win game as card packs are alot of money/gold and you don\'t win alot of money either.   One thing to bare in mind is that once you\'ve completed a level you can go back and claim all the cards from that event giving you more money, cars and rq.',
       'Multiplayer is not fair. Have the same car with lower 0-60 time better traction, and higher mph but still lose. Match play is getting worse. I either have to spend a boatload of money or always come in last place.',
       'Fun game that I do still enjoy... BUT more/different content needs to be added as far as events and practice races.  Also I have been VERY dissapointed with the support team,  and just learned they offer special deals to lower tier players that I van not access? SHADY! So it is too bad but I wont be spending more money on this one until I see any improvements.',
       'Graphics and cars are great but the complements end there. I have no idea what the point of this game is it\'s not a racing game though. You just collect card with cars on them. It\'s a shame i wish i could race the cars.' ,
    recentChanges: 
      '"Two iconic British manufacturers in one update! Jaguar brings everything from the stunning XKSS historic racer and beautiful E-Type to the brutal Project 8. Land Rover gives you some brilliant new options in those tricky off-road races.',

      'It\'s a really great game for a fps online. I\'ll rate 9/10 because of the crash I\'m getting sometimes. Whenever it load a game, it just crashed into home screen. Hopefully it will be fix soon and make sure to notify me when it fixed. I really love this. This might be the best fps game I\'ve played so far.',
       'It\'s a great game overall, great controls and everything. The only downfall is there is to many hackers... from radar hacks to bullet rain. I hope this game makes a better anti-cheat. I am also a content creator so feel free to check out my channel :  AtomixGaming C-OPS',
       'Good game. Addictive, biggest problem is the lag and non stop inflow of hackers.  Im sick of NOT getting a ranked game in aus!!!! Please have more ranked games IN AUS or else have everyone in a different server so we all have the same ping. Now i can\'t login from my phone but tablet i can, WHY???? Moderators dont do much and i\'ve never heard back from support. Please reply to this so i can change my rating',
       'I absolutely love this game, but i have one question: will you add the AWP sniper rifle in the game because this is the best moblile version of cs go but i dislike the u ratio so is it possible to add it. Thank you and keep up the good work.ü§ó',
       'Sucked. Graphics and game play are inconsistent. Laggy, and no scoring system or room for advancements. No way to change weapons without exiting the battle. Needs a lot of work and then will still probably be lower grade then all the fps games on the market.',

      'I enjoy this game a lot for their variety of games. I will say the starting bonus is very generous. The clubs are fun if you find a good one to be a part of. My only issue is the payout system... It seems when you make a decent win, your chances of winning anything are greatly reduced for a period of time,on any game or slots. No jackpot yet. The ads are not bad.. At all. I won\'t give up.. And I\'m not the only one who notices the payout system.. I won\'t put my own money into this game just yet.. And if I run out I\'ll uninstall. But definitely give this one a try if ur looking for a good Casino Game.',
       'So i liked the game enough to over look the constant in app purchase ads and advertisments that are timed perfectly to get you to accidently tap them. But what just made me uninstall this game was this: Twice now i have hit raise or bet in texas hold em\' and instead the game folds my very obvious winning hand. Whether it is a technical issue or not, i dont care. There are better games out there that dont have this issue, and i suggest you play those instead of this one.  Phone Specs: Galaxy S7, fully updated OS, apps, etc., Verizon service provider.',
       'HORRIBLE. The graphics and slots are cool. But what fun is a game that is almost impossible to win at. I say that because I play 5 different accounts and 3 I haven\'t won anything nice in almost 6 months and 2 it\'s been about 3. Bad luck you keep telling me, I say it\'s all the updates you have done. You guys ruined what was once a fun game. If you looking to have fun and win, look some place else. I\'ve been trying for months to establish a descent chip count, not happening on this game',
       'This game was fun but now a huuge waste of money.  You make a big purchase to play at minimal bets for 15 minutes. They did numerouse recent "updates" and now almost every person you talk to says how bad it is now.  Thatnks a ton for ruining what used to be a good game.',
       'I enjoy playing your slot games.  They are captivating and entertaining. However, I have noticed a little "trick" with the algorithm... I have observed that when I started playing, I would win at a decent frequency and would win a decent amount.  The longer I play, the longer between wins, and the less I win. Fewer and fewer wins are taking the fun out of it for me and have me contemplating looking for another game.',
       'Like the slots, hate the lousy pathetic payouts. Really tight and horrifically greedy gaming. I will NOT buy any chips and urge any players to also NOT buy any chips. Same old BS response sighting "BadLuck". That\'s totally unacceptable. Losing over 26 Billion twice and over 11 billion twice is not Bad Luck. To me I saw a calculated takedown. I couldn\'t win at all. Your canned response doesn\'t make any sense. I bought chips in the past but I won\'t EVER buy any more ever again. Very frustrating!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!' ,

      'I do like this game. The support team is good and are helpful when they can be. But the silver and points awarded are much too low in my opinion, when in comparison to the costs of modules and supplies consumed during battles. Also the supply crates could stand to be better. The ships are pretty awesome and are very well rendered. Very good graphics. Everything runs smoothly with no lag or server issues.',
       'This game is great, it\'s a lot of fun. Until it decides that you\'re not allowed to pass the loading screen.  Then there\'s the premium store. The pricing is pretty outrageous for a mobile game. $35 for a t5? I paid less than that for my Matilda IV on WOT. Please address this issue. So we can actually show you our patronage. You occupy our spare 15 minutes. Not hours daily. Think of where this is played and charge accordinly. That\'s all I have to say.',
       'Haifuri brought me here I am sure this will be a pretty interesting game. I heard hsf harekaze and hsf spee is going to be here cant wait for it....  I encountered a game bug.. I was using a destroyer class ship and the steering wheel won\'t turned after I  pressed the left steer the ship just went on spinning left...please resolve this issue\'s',
       'This is a great game!!.  Yes, computers have issues, yes its short then the PC version.  This is not a PC.  This is a great 5 minute break.  I play the PC game too.  Its flipping fantastic.  The programmers at WOW are brilliant  and they care about the product.  If you love histroy, Warships, strategic games pitting you against other human players.  GET THIS YOUR GAME.  There are other warship games.  None get it more right then WOW.',
       'The games mechanics and controls need an overhaul. The secondary weapons should be automated as fast firing ships operating in touch screen controls requires immense micro management. Second, the post battle screen graphs extremely limited battle details and the UI is equally as lacking in features and navigation. Finally, the battle time is far to short and the majority of battles are ended with ships still in action on both teams. Potential to be a 5 star rating when the mechanics become as user friendly as they they are on PC.',
       'Just perfect, the graphics are amazing especialy with IOS but in android is also extremely good. So OF COURSE i whould recomend it to someone to kill their time. Last but not least... i don\'t know, JUST DOWNLOAD IT I DONT HAVE ANYTHING ELSE TO SAY!!!' ,

      'So I\'m changing my review. After the past few updates I have won more special dice!! They lowered the level from extra impossible to meduim on the dice Masters, so it\'s a tad bit more fair! The only problem need, is the daily challenge is too much for the app to stay open. It force closes due to over processing or something, and I\'d rather not have the daily challenge and the game work lol. But definitely gaining more stars each update from me!!',
       'Scopely is the most greedy, disgusting company I have ever seen. The ads they have littered into the game play literally crash the game at least 4 times during a match. You will see about 10 ads on top of the crashing per game; you could be in mid roll and the ad will ruin it. So desperate for money.. Don\'t support scopelys terrible practices.',
       'Its ok if you play against other people but if you play any of the challenges they have against the computer  you lose. They give so many days and you get nothing and have 0 across your board but the computer gas 3 plus yahtzees and over 300 points everytime. Not just 1 or 3 this is 32 times I\'ve played and it\'s happened. Just not worth it if you can\'t win a single challenge honestly.

      'Love all the Lego apps. They know Legos are awesome enough that playing with some digital versions is enough to promote buying the physical bricks. ~~~~ NO ADS - Just Fun! ~~~ Even the adults like this one. It\'s comparable to minions paradise but with all the waiting and advertising removed.',
       'I would put a zero if I could. This is by far the worst LEGO game ever, and like always it\'s very boring and has poor graphics and gameplay. What is anything creative here? The fact that you get to choose what you build? It is so stupid on so many levels. I do not recommend this game.',
       'Absolutely shocked, appalled and quite frankly disgusted. I dont know if anyone else has experienced what my 7yr old son has but on loading the game he was shown a flashing image of a man getting stabbed in the eye. This gqme has been removed and i have reported it to the video standards board that apply ratings on these games. Not sure how these things are even possible?',
       'ABSOLUTELY TERRIBLE! You say customise, the game shows three options for set buildings. Try to put lego pieces back in their place? FAIL! It\'s basically made by an amatuer and a failiure.',
       'Needs more lands needs more money fast more of every thing. Needs cooler stuff needs better music needs more animals/this century animals needs heroes and Lego Spiderman. Make the planes and automobiles go far and needs more people and jobs to do.',
       'I\'m 20 years old not a fan of lego but this i really really like. It would be fun if they add more islands in. But it really good' ,

      'Overall I liked the game. However, I have a few suggestions to make. First, could you please make it so the fish food is more effective or that you can upgrade it as another review said. Second, please make the time shorter because 1 hour is really long and gems are so hard to earn. Third, please make the tank more interactive. Like, you could make it so you can give the fish fish food or breed the fish or make the fish swim around freely instead of in their own level of water. Thanks!!!',
       'I love this game, it\'s fun, cute, and I love collecting these fish!The only thing is that I don\'t want to end up finishing this game too quickly, just wish there were more fish so the game could last a long time. Overall though, I think this game is awesome and you guys did a great job! And I know my opinion doesn\'t really matter since I\'m just one kid, but I really like this game.',
       'Adorable. I like how everything can be upgraded, catching the fish is the best part. Its very fun. You should really tell people that they can just swipe up in their aquarium to see their other fish because a lot of people seem to be confused by that. Other than than it\'s a cute game.',
       'I enjoy playing this game because the visuals are cute and the different fish you can collect are very interesting. I have a few problems with the game though, like how you can accidently waste your gems on getting a fish to come (It\'s hard to get gems in this game...). Also, there\'s not much to do in the fish tank. Other than that, it\'s a good game.',
       'The game is so awesome !!!! I love this game . It\'s very addictive . Can you add more fishes,  baits,  characters and more in the future ??.... PLEASE!!!! And the main thing is , please reduce the waiting time ..... You have wait like 1 hour which is too much .',
       'Addicting and enjoyable, with a charming art style and ambience to match. I adore it, and so do my younger siblings. The pop culture references are clever and fun to discover. I do agree that gems being easier to obtain/more interaction with your aquarium would be noteworthy updates, but love the game all the same. :)' ,

      'Not responsive to most touches. I finally got a cheat only to realize it was the game.  Ads were not frequent but had a strobe light going off (health issues) and would not turn off. Had to close out of the game every time so I just quit playing. Typo many similar more challenging games out there to try and work with this one.',
       'Some things are hidden in such a place makes it hard on note 8 due to curved screen. Level 89 doesn\'t work, as well as other levels where touching the same place over and over and over might get something to work.  Most puzzles are extremely easy,  it\'s just a matter of the game not working.',
       'Got stuck playing til lvl 40 before I realized an hour had past, and I only came to the play store looking for sonic 3, but this looked interesting listed under "recomended." Great recommendation.',
       'Some levels are straight forward. Others you just have to skip because there\'s no logic or something is missing. Could be good with some type of help if you get stuck rather than just skipping an entire level.',
       'Items don\'t move when they are supposed to therefore making it impossible to complete each task. It is very frustrating because the game would be more fun. It would make it more enjoyable with at least 1 or 2 hints.',
       'I found it boring. A character in the game tells you what to do, where to find the key etc and you do it, then you move a level up. How is that exciting? But millions of people do, so go figure.' ,

And this is first time i\'m very exited when i managed to finish a level, even after that, i repeat again till i can surpass it perfectly. Even i haven\'t sleep for 2 days, felt like an alien or zombie, etc. But this game cheers me up alot. Recommended ? Yes! Good job dev, just download it guys. Lu pasti hepi dah! Keren!',
       'Wow... as I was writing this review it suddenly all disappeared as it said unfortunately traffic rider has stopped. Wow.. nice. I cannot even open the game without freezing up my tablet. Real nice. And tbh I love this game! On my phone it works..... üò•üò£üòàüëπ',
       'There are some idiot missions such as combo overheading. I would give this game 5 stars if not those missions.',
       'I can\'t stop playing this!! The missions are really hard and thats what makes it fun! although i almost threw my phone twice. but this game is amazing! the graphic is good too!',
       'I brought lots of upgrades and didn\'t play for some time. Installed on my new phone, same google account and now everything is gone. I feel completely ripped off!',
       'Pretty cool..It was actually a little more than i expected.  The bikes are cool. They seem to be modeled after actual bikes, but perhaps didnt want to pay 4 the licensing to use actual manufacturer names.' ,

      'Do not spend any money on this game. This used to be one of the best slot games until the developers got greedy. Payouts are small and events are nearly impossible. They try to make it all sound good but it\'s not. They also changed the customer service on here where it\'s hard to get anyone. You cannot message them on Facebook if you have a problem and if you say anything negative about the game you will be blocked. Hope this review saves some of you some time so you can find a better game!',

But huuuge has made changes to the game which makes it harder to get puzzles and always trying to sell chips  lottery tickets just to play constantly and it\'s frustrating other than that I love the game.  Use to be easy to get puzzles and be fun to play it\'s becoming about money for Huuuge always selling or you have to buy something..',
       'Thks game is just like being in a real casino, plenty of different slots and so many to choose from only difference is you don\'tt gotta explain nothing to your wife as to why y\'all all of a sudden gotta leave move or put in more time at the toaster factory in order to get the lights turned back on. I just think its great you people let us play these here slots all day and dont cost us nothing to do it. Thats about all i gotta say bout that.

      'I love this game. Its and absolute tome waster and lovely to play. However, I had set my phone to the side to let it play out (as I was over 1400) and it reset on its own. I had cleared the screen the round previously so there was no chance of me losing to that. It was behind me and I never would have reset it. Is this some sort of glitch? If it is, please fix it soon. Aside from this, this is amazing.',
       'I beat my high score, & watched the ad to get a second turn.  Great right?  Apparently not.  I always try to press the back button to get out of ads once they are over, but that didn\'t work.  So I pressed the \'X\' in the top right corner & boom... The #&$@&#@ Play Store opens... So I went to close it... & The Play Store replaced the game!!!! So when I closed it, I closed the game... So yeah I\'m pretty triggered.  I PRESSED THE \'X\'!  The game itself is awesome. But now I\'m triggered.  Please fix that.',
       'I really, really love this game, but, I keep losing my ball count and I don\'t understand why this is happening. For instance, I have 90 balls and I\'m supposed to have 92, I don\'t get the 92. I will give 5 stars until the bug is fixed. The ads I don\'t care about because that only happens at the end of each game which is ok. Please fix this so I can give you 5 stars.  Update- I figured out why I keep losing my count with my balls. Everytime I get the balls by the number blocks, it wouldn\'t count themüòê I could get a lot further if this was fixed. If this keeps on happening, I\'m going to uninstall this game. I hope it doesn\'t come to that because I really love this game. Please fix asap!!',
       'If I could give zero (0) stars for controls, that would be too high. The game is fun and addictive. But there is a restart button that there is NO REASON FOR. I have lost my progress three times with scores over 1000, which takes weeks to achieve. THE DEVELOPER DOES NOT RESPOND EVER. Uninstalling.',
       'It\'s good at first but you\'ll lose returning customers. Where are the power ups? Maybe an ultra bull that acts as 2 hits each turn. Nothing is drawing me back to and having me for higher school. In fact high score just means waiting longer. Could potentially be a great game.',
       'Best ever! Addicted to it. Cute graphics and fun color make it great! The aim-and-fire technique makes it original! Installed it 2 days ago, top score 72 average score 50!  P.S. If you like this app (which you probably do) try Amazing Thief! Great and another Ketchapp marvel! I\'m not spoiling it, but I will tell you it\'s a lot like Flappy Bird. If you don\'t know what Flappy Bird is, well then look it up.  P.P.S.  Anyone here would probably have at least SEEN Flappy Bird, but seriously. It is like an Aztec-age game.' ,

      'Fab game. Wish you could have the option of it fixing into place as it turns the entire cube (diagonal facing) but brilliant otherwise. Saved me buying a real 5x5 since its pretty much the same as solving my 4x4 and 3x3. I like the timer too great app üòÅ',
       'Worst app. I thought it would teach how to slove an 8√ó8 Rubik\'s cube. But its just waste of time',
       'Camera control is confusing. But overall it\'s a good app to solve cubes you don\'t have',
       'The controls is kind of hard because when you try to solve the 5 by 5 and up it thinks you are pressing something else at the same t8me',

      'Loading to start game is rediculus. Takes 1gb nearly everytime you load it. Story part gets way too hard to manage keeping up with the difficulty even when you pay the subscription unless you spend real money to move along. It\'s a kids game, people don\'t have the money to keep up with the difficulty. I will be unsubscribing, subscription doesn\'t justify the price, everything costs too much and can\'t progress in the game because of price. Great game, shame it\'s destroyed by greed.',
       'It\'s a great game but it\'s such a money pit. 9 out of 10 times if you want something, you better get a credit card out otherwise you\'re waiting 4 days to unlock it. If it weren\'t for that, I\'d have given 5 stars.',
       'The game is not letting me in the game. and i have wifi. So i thought i don\'t have a lot of space so i checked and i had a lot of space and my wifi is good. I don\'t know what\'s the problem please fix this problem. Overall the game is great.',
       'Actually this game is very good but still...  It crashes if you dont have a good phone because i have an samsung at it crashes 1/3 times. Please fix this thank you',
       'Keep crashing after I win an arena game. Fix it. Great game though love the system. Don\'t need to spend anything to progress unless you really wanna jump ahead and get the best dinos',
       'Cooldown for battle is way to long and to advance you have to pay. Which i have honestly and its more enjoyable. The new update makes it unplayable on wifi and if you play on data it disconnects unless you have perfect service.' ,

      'Honestly I think it\'s amazing that they sell this game for free because it is one of the best games I\'ve ever played in my life. It doesn\'t take any internet and the animals in details so good and the graphics. If you\'re ever bored you should download this game and play it all the time.',
       'Sometimes it feels like the difficulty of the levels is way off. Levels labeled "hard" or "super hard" are many times much easier than standard levels. I do enjoy the amount of unlimited lives given, and the speed at which lives are replenished, however. Overall, a good time-passer',
       'Guys, you have a glitch that needs fixed. Side game (right now the ignite game) causes app to close every time. Also... Inserting the gold in the piggy bank takes way too long. Speeding up that process or allowing a skip feature would be nice.',
       'It\'s been at least 3 or 4 weeks since I\'ve been able to accept any lives given by friends. For a game that has so many downloads, developers sure have an issue addressing mad fixing it. I\'ve list roughly 100 lives to this issue. Please fix it!!!',
       'I adore this game. However, I have had 7 gold bars for over a year and every time I win a level that awards lots of gold bars the game tells me my bank is full... even though everything costs at least 9 gold bars. According to my math I should have over 100 bars. I would settle for two at this point.',
       'Highly addictive. I love this game but there is one fault that it doesn\'t allow your device to enter sleep mode. I have ruined 2 phone screens with burnt in images because of this. I would fall asleep playing the game and when I wake up it\'s still on the screen.  I also don\'t understand why the special games are not offered on the Facebook game.' ,

      'Good I hope they fixed the bug where you double buy a car and it gives you the same car but still takes your money. But its still a great game. Ohh! And also raise thr chance if getting a legendary I played for almost a year and I never got one l. My friend got one all the time on his apple but there Is a glitch with android.ive never had one.',
       'It\'s good but... I enjoy playing this game, there isn\'t too much skill involved but it\'s a good way to kill time and it stays easy enough to make it enjoyable while raising the difficulty.  The only thing I want to see is no more of this, automatically backing up stuff. When you are nose first in an object, the game automatically backs you up, but I\'ve lost countless games because it doesn\'t stop or doesn\'t back up enough. Let me choose when to back up!',
       'Excellent could use weapon pickup like smoke machine gun or oil slick.... A health bar which is unique to each vehicle depending on if it is made for speed or for just ramming stuff and an add health pickup... a bouncing red or blue stack of cash equal to a hundred dollars once action picks up and a 1000 dollar pickup after a ten minute counter for those who have gotten very good and lastly an arrest count down when stopped.... Sometimes you get only a breif second to get away other times you get like ten seconds???',
       'Good but... you can sometimes glich and get trapped but it\'s a good game anyway like you run from police. Also when you start off you have to press right or left to start so you can\'t go straight forward when you get on. I really liked it though it is one of my favourite games! I\'m out  Later ima go play some Smashy Road now!',
       'Good, but has some bugs I\'m sorry if I\'m being too critical in this review but especially on Mobile Data, Smashy Road can lag. This is to the extent the game will no longer work. Moving on to a positive, the graphical interface is very nice, the perspective, movement and background vehicles is very well created.  Very good game overall',
       'Shalom there, The game is awesome. I liked it very much and hoping that in the future they will be more cars to be added. I really hope that "military helicopter" can shoot something, it is funny...so idle. Last thing, a HOVERCRAFT can go "river mode" ! Wrecked... because of...water. Hope you\'ll add the " police boats " in next update. Overall, abundant of thanks and good luck.' ,

      'I played it on my Dad\'s phone, but only until I got my own tablet. But every time I try to play it on my tablet,(at the title screen)it crashes, and sez:Error. Unfortunately, MERLOK 2.0 has  crashed. PLEASE FIX THE ANNOYING ERROR!!!!!!!!!!!',
       'The game is very good but the thing is that when merlok is like "hmm, not sure if Ava gog all the bugs out..." and it tells me to go on the Nexo scan thing (it\'s the only thing i can do anyway because its forcing me to) and it plays the nexo scan sound with the screen dark at the same time and then it suddenly goes all quiet with the music stops playing and it does NOTHING!!!! ITS REALLY FRUSTRATING!!! FIX.   IT.    NOW!!!',
       'This is good but you need to reduce the price of the upgrades the knight have. One little question how did Axls battle suit be free because you  unlock it with the Lego Id?',
       'It takes a steady hand perfect lighting and perfect focus to scan powers and i have none of the three and it u have to buy sets plurar to collect strong powers, not everyone can afford it',
       'My younger cousin really enjoys this game and it keeps him entertained for hours, which is gr8 as he has ADHD. The only problem that stops us from giving this game a 5 star rating is a small bug, on the fact that he can\'t get through to arronville which upsets and annoys him when the game crashes, please fix this problem as it would be a brilliant help to us. Thanks. Btw I would recommend this game , just beware of some small problmes but dont worry as they always update this app to sort these problems out.',

      'So I love the app but in free mode it will let you play.missions.. In a couple of the missions I have noticed it has given me 200 passengers to bring to a airplane boat (forgot what its called) and you cannot land a plane big enough for 200 passengers on it! No room to land without the wing getting clipped off by the tower and no place to take off from it! Other than that it is an awesome game',
       'I\'ve been losing sleep for days now playing this incredible game. Hahaha! Great graphics, smooth controls, realistic sounds, and easy-to-navigate interface. It doesn\'t force users to pay real money to fully enjoy and access the game. I wish the game offers a first-person mode where you get to play inside the cockpit and navigate the aircraft. That would be so much extra fun! Hats off to the team behind the game\'s development! :)',
       'Pretty cool app. I\'d like it more the planes/jets could be personalized with personal/or existing airline company names and if you could play commercial type flying modes. All without having to level up or earn money or pay real money for. Like a free fly mode. Oh,oh... and that there was real life situations that happen as a result of no fly zones and stuff. Otherwise it\'s pretty cool so far.',
       'A really good game to play if your board and have nothing to do. Its proberly one of the best flight simulators on mobile devices ive ever played. The graphics are acctually really good for a mobile game that runs smoothly. The controles can somtimes be wonky but youll get used to it. I love to play this game i really enjoy. The best thing about it is that, its FREE! Good job \'fun games for free\' üëèüëåüñí‚ò∫',
       'Was able to start playing right away because of the level of simplicity and yet you have to learn so you can challenge yourself in the more advanced campaigns that soon come up. The game will leave you finding out that a couple of hours has passed in a blink of an eye because of the fun you\'re having. I really just started the game so I will come back and update this in a few months as I advance in the game.',
       'This is the most addictive flight simulator I have ever played. The game is fairly easy to progress through without having to spend any money. If I had to find one fault it would be that you can\'t reverse when on a runway which means some times you have no option but to crash your plane as there is very little room to turn around.' ,

      'I love the game :) ,but can you add unlimited ammo and u can deliver any vehicle u own for free, if our only gonna do one of these, at least add u can deliver your vehicles for free any time. And oh yeah, add multiplayer where u can join someone the host decides whether the server is public or private. And that you can friend people with the Facebook thing. Thank you and keep on adding cool stuff! P.S. add that you can turn on and off friendly fire when host for when you add the multiplayer option and add weather like in the winter it snows and sometimes it rains. Sorry its long but please do all of these things to make the game even better!!!!!!!!',
       'I LOVE THIS GAME!!!! Alot of things you can do, very fun and the missions are EPIC!  Although there are a few things gameloft needs to add/change: 1. Multiplayer 2. We can die and not spend money going to hospital 3. make graphics better 4. Go inside houses and shops  5. customize cars',
       'Awesome! The latest update rewards old and loyal players like me with the new trophy system, which gives us more than 1000 diamonds for what we\'ve achieved in the past few months. Removing the key system is another thing that we want to thank God of Games for. Keep up the good work. Will be supporting Gameloft in the future.',
       'This game is one of the BEST games i\'ve ever played in my whole life! The graphics,gameplay,story,cars,etc are all amazing! But i have one complain please give the original price of the cheap materials pack... But overall its the best Good Job Devs',
       'Sir i have some problems. My suits has low DPS from my other friends I upgrade all skills but nothing happend. My osteo x mediam lvl.1 has 840DPS and i compare my friends they has more DPS.  When i up on the small vehicle with my  Monster Truck(heavy vehicle)  the small vehicles can\'t wreak. Plzzzzz do something for me. It\'s a request.',
       'It\'s nice but mission fourth is very complicated as well as conjustedly tough. I would like this and would give full stars but my opinion is it should be more graphical, adjustable control,nicely gamed and less storagable. I hope that instead of ignoring the matter you should modify the game and improve it. This is my feedback and you should definitely do it please it\'s my applicapable request.' ,

      'I play real poker and do pretty well. This game is clearly made to force you to lose your chips and buy chips. They are obvious bots, and the amount of time I have a great hand on a turned and get called by absolutely  nothing but lose on the river is just unreal. I understand it happens, but it happens way too often in this. I have spent alot of real money on thia game in the past, and now I just remembered why I actually stopped playing it',
       'I would like the game very much never had to spend it on time kind of addictive. I can figure the game out sometimes very easily other times not. You can usually tell whether you\'re going to be lucky (those are the times to hit the slot machine while you\'re playing). Sometimes the hardest part e dealing with it dummies who think it\'s bingo. And sometimes I got to admit how you had enough time and I\'ll play that way too but that\'s usually when the game teaches you a lesson at other times it\'s very predictable and I know that I\'m going to get that hand but it\'s fun',
       'Fun game. Most of what I know about this game, I\'ve actually learned by playing it on this app. And yes, it\'s very addictive!! And yes, anyone with negative comments???...they haven\'t taken the time to REALLY know & learn the game & it\'s rules. Just because ya lose...doesn\'t make it a bad game!! LEARN THE GAME & ITS RULES, SPEND A LITTLE TIME ACTUALLY PLAYING, (WITH GOOD SPORTSMANSHIP)...AND YOU\'LL LOVE IT. The more ya play, the better it gets!!',
       'More ad pushes and Facebook posting than anything I\'ve over downloaded. Posts without asking and you can\'t play a single game without 20 notifications asking you to spend money or share it with friends. Popular game but can\'t do anything for 10 minutes after opening app until you sift through all the nonsense they throw at you.',
       'There\'s a small bug - once you lost all your money in a tournament, you can\'t see the cards of the other opponents after the show down... Besides that, the app is perfect. I wish I could have this interface in real life games.',
       'App is complete garbage. Caters to $$$. Period. Their eCogra certification is a complete scam and so is the company who issues them. If you want to lose EVERY SINGLE HAND to the worst hand, then this game is for you. If you want a REAL poker game, choose another. The only response they ever give is to refer to their certification which i addressed above. Warning, do not download.' ,

      'I am not sure that having umpteen levels is really such a good thing. Once you have done the first 20 they all feel the same. Given how easy they are I would have wanted a timer to add some challenge to it. Also, while I fully understand that devs need to get paid, this game has way too many ads for enjoyment',
       'The game was okay. I felt like the puzzles were pretty easy to solve, even on the advanced levels. Also, there were a LOT of ads, which got in the way of the game. If you\'re looking to just kill time though, it\'s a simple app!',
       'TOO MANY ADS. Reading the reviews, this has been the main complaint about this game for several years and nothing has been done with cutting back the ads. Literally half the time spent on this game is waiting for the ads.',
       'Puzzles become repetitive.... but still difficulty to solve in less moves than it took last time!! Also, my progress didn\'t transfer when I switched phones.... Which meant a lot more playing than initially anticipated',

      'Really fun.  But crashes constantly on my Galaxy S5.  Then I have to force stop the app, and restart my phone to get it working, for about 5 minutes....  All have to do to avoid ads is not restart until the respawn timer clears, so they aren\'t that bad, and it\'s really cheap to turn the ads off.  I would happily do so, it the app would run for more than 5 minutes.  If it wasn\'t for the crashing, I would rate it 4 stars at least.',
       'Love playing this game...very addictive! I would rate it 5* if there was a reason for why you level up and why you keep spinning for little lightening bolts when you do level up  as once you have bought the small amount on offer they are no longer needed. Add more things to buy and give the game a reason for levelling up ü§òüèº',
       'Smooth game. Plenty of fire ball options and endless level options but after every death you have to watch  15 second ad. EVERY DEATH. Which just spoils the experience and all. I understand ads but like after 3 deaths that\'s fine. But after every death and some are unskippable. So download of you have patience. It\'s worth it of you have time to spend',
       'A wonderful aesthetically pleasing game.  Get as far as you can, with as many points as you can while unlocking different fireballs and portals. I would love to see how this game evolves in the future and i have not seen as many ad\'s as people claim so perhaps that issue has been resolved? Working perfectly on S8+',
       'TOO MANY ADS, every time you die you get an ad and that\'s just being money hungry what ever happened to games without long ads what\'s the point if you\'re gonna make a game and 1/3 of the gameplay being ads. Perhaps every 10 or 20 games, or just have those small popup ads, but don\'t ruin the gameplay because you want money. I\'m uninstalling and I\'m sure other people are as well.',
       'I don\'t understand what is everyone\'s problem here. The developers are, like every other developer, trying to make money and you complain about ads in a free game? Well I\'ve had a lot of fun with this game and I will keep on playing it.' ,

      'The controls are simple.. it comes down to timing and playing it multiple times to get the most out of the combination of timing and luck. I haven\'t figured out yet how to score super well, but it is fine. I kind of wish there was more to it control wise, as right now it seems like just a matter of well timing and random luck',
       'This game is very buggy. I wouldn\'t pay for this. Your reward is 50nstsrs after completing the continental cup, yet you get 30. Then I went out do the game and went back in to see if it somehow didn\'t add, but instead I was left with 0 stars. Also the screen blacks out a lot.',
       'Integration with the adds glitches the gameplay.  It freezes quite frequently. If this gets fixed it will be more fun and interesting. If it would work without glitches and adds in between jumps it would be awesome. Try putting adds before each competition instead of in the middle. I am updating my review. It sucks! !!! I just  finished the season and everything I earned and bought just disappeared. UNINSTALL! !!!',
       'This could be so much better. When you\'ve completed a season...you then lose everything for a second season. I stayed on the season to improve scores and buy better equipment..but although my scores were improving my positions were getting worse and worse which doesn\'t make sense. Even when you hit the hill record but still come 8th....what?!?!',
       'Great looking  game, spoiled by the controls..  Tap to start the jump=OK, Tap to take off=OK, Tap to land=Too hard.. As a casual gamer you really need to either practice, practice, practice!!.. Or.. Have the landing reflexes of a Ninja!!  If for the casual gamer landing was a tad more user friendly it would definitely be 5*..  Not a game to send hours & hours on, but certainly a good time waster for a journey.. Give it a try & give Team GB a World Champion Ski Jumper!! (& the less said about Eddie "The Eagle" Edwards the better..)',
       'It\'s a great game so mental and challengeing I no it will keep you amused for a long time the controls are very sensitive so practice as much as you can before you decide to try out the career mode play happy it\'s funtastic' ,

      'Extremely fun game to play with your family and friends. Only 2 suggestions: 1) The final game is boring compared to the rest, and it\'s annoying I cannot avoid playing one mode and 2) It should be possible to personalize questions with the 4 images, too. One minor issue: it\'s not possible to change the language of the application. I downloaded it with my default EN language but I use to play it with my family in IT language. Is it possible to fix this issue?',
       'This is a great party game that gives hours of fun. I am unsure why they covered up "Sargon of Akkad" from the backs of one of the choice cards since release, I\'m guessing that\'s the bug they fixed?',

If you want something simalur to Minecraft the closest thing is crafting and building you can even go on cools servers and stuff and it\'s almost just like mcpe. This game needs a lot of work and it should still be in beta.',

      'Uninstalling. The controls are imprecise (ball would slip off the desired direction occasionally) and the order of the colours would make it impossible to win on occasion. I can forgive the first thing (muscle) but making it impossible to win is not forgivable.  Work on the algorithm.',
       'Games really nice good mind challenge, great for color match making if color blind. You may not know what colors your matching however, ever since i started playing i\'ve also been getting better at matching my clothes and random day to day organising of colored items. Love the game however the ball simetimes seems to go where it wants to instead of where you released it... I noticed this a few times i would aim let go and the line would randomly jump to a new spot and the ball shots almost a completely diffrent location',
       'It was great at first. Addicting. I was really looking forward to more levels but they suck. Too many kinds of bubbles. Why did the update change old levels too? Major disappointment.  Edit 2/19/18: it was back to being great when they took away all the extra kinds of bubbles. But after a few hundred levels...they\'re back. Balls with three locks, slime, water bubbles or whatever that is. Lured people back in and then disappointed again.',

      'Seems fun, but there is at least a 10 second ad every time you crash and it\'s really frustrating. I think Acid Cousins is really losing a lot of people to the excessive advertising present in this app even though the game itself has a lot of potential.',
       'Ads pop up during gameplay where your fingers contact so it stops game play ... other than that it\'s good but I\'ve had enough. Fk you chilly:-p uninstalling',
       'The game was awesome and I loved it. But the latest update ruined it with ADS. They put the banner exactly where you mostly tap with the fingers to change direction, the game got laggy which it was not before and has started getting way too many pop ups. Uninstalling. *Sigh*',
       'Don\'t waste your time. This is such an awesome game but all the ads make it not even close to worth playing. They put an ad in the bottom of the screen at all times. This is the most optimal spot to tap to control your little skier. Forces you to make your thumb further up and block part of your view. Plus full screen 30 second ads every third game.... When most games only last a few seconds, makes for a pretty bad experience. You almost hade hooked Google, way to drop the ball.',
       'It intercepts the back press event and doesn\'t allow to quit in the common way. It continuously places the advertisement banner on the bottom of the page and goes to immersive mode so you\'ll hit the ad instead of navigation bar while you are hopelessly trying to exit. Maybe the game itself is not bad but that disrespect overtakes all the pluses (if they are)',
       'Great game! Simplistic in the greatest form from graphics to game play. Would be 5 stars but -1 for placement of bottom ad I mean so easy to accidentally hit. Well placed I\'m sure....With recent update I think you get random ad runs too. Game 5+ stars. 4 because of ads..' ,

      'I love this game but I have a couple of requests 1st. Could you add u YouTuber skin back like boy,girl,animal then YouTuber 2nd. Could you add a button that you can press that alows you to make your own custom paint job for any vehicle that would be amazing 3rd. Can you make and road that ends come back into the city at the other side example the road behind the hospital 4th. Could add like 5 houses around the city that you can go into 5th. More vehicles   If you agree with what I have sead in this comment like so the developer can see!',
       'Ok I get it but why do the army kill you for no reason? I like this game because you can do roleplay and I\'m a girl and there is girl skins which is amazing but can you start with a girl skin and a boy skin to be fair with the girls  Pls do these. Love your company :-) but can you add a roleplay mode that would be great DO MORE:-) but now on my new tablet it won\'t let me play it please fix that and reply',
       'Good. However, the apple versioned platform overwhelms us by many advantages: They can earn coins and cash quicker n easier. They get options on what currency they use to purchase things. They get to higher leagues easier. Their weapon description overpasses ours as ours literally gives us damage and capacity whereas theirs comes with fire rate, trait etc.',
       'I love this game. But for the next update, u should give each skin there own special ability. Like the flash and hulk skins. Give the flash super speed, give hulk super strength and etc. So that everyone can get a different type of advantage. Plz make this happen next update also make a goku skin. So u can turn super saiyan. And have other transformation. So can u plz have every skin to have different abilities that match the skin',
       'I have been playing the game for 6 or 5 years and it has been the best game i have played. So, i  think you have to make this game better in the next update.Here r my suggestions 1 make the graphics better. 2 day and night shift. 3police attacks bandit in adventure mode.4 add a clan.  I hope u will add these in the next update.Also too many players that hacked their health so plz fix it.Thx',
       'Well while there is nothing wrong within the game, that being that everything is great, there is one thing that I don\'t like. This game is full of hackers, and modders who make it so that the others lose their stars, lose what they have earned along with my self included. If you could punish these people in some way to show them that it\'s not okay to cheat in the game then that would be amazing for the people who ACTUALLY promote the love for this game. Thank you.' ,

      'It would be a real good app if they didn\'t have so many ads popping up. Budge needs to reevaluate this because it\'s not making my kid want more games...its making her hate this game. It\'s not an effective strategy...and no parent would download another budge game after seeing one ad a minute.',
       'It\'s a good game but I\'m telling you. There are way too many ads. 30 second ads without a skip ad button seriously I spend 80% trying to exit the ad then I do playing the game. I see that everyone else is complaining about the same thing. So Delete the ads Please. And please make all of the Ponies free. Some of the levels required a different pony but you have to buy them. Drag and drop is broken. Please fix it.',
       'My kid loved this game. She got really into it and was loving every moment, but then a part of the game wouldnt let her do anything. It was a boss scene on a pinkie pie level and a drop and drag boss on a rarity level. The game simply wont do anything and hence she cant get any farther. This is frustrating as i paid for all the stuff for it as she enjoyed it so much and its beginning to feel like i paid for my kid to be sad. Please fix!',
       '"drag and drop the broken bits into the right place" game locks up and little 4 year old girl cries. Now I know why these games get hacked by little sisters older brother. People get pissed. Enjoy your money budge!',
       'Let\'s talk about ads. I downloaded this for my kid. She would love it except for the fact that EVERY 30 SECONDS THERE IS AN AD! I realize that\'s how money is made, but that\'s ridiculous. One at the end of each level would be fine, but this 4-5 inside the level is overkill. And they play upside down. She spends more time trying to exit the ad than playing the game.',
       'AMAZING Now don\'t blame me for loving this, I know there is not many levels, too many ads, but this is very active for kids. It can make thier reflex better! Can season 2 just come out already?' ,

       'Controls are odd. There should be an air roll button to make it easier to land on your wheels. Actually make it online too, that might be pretty neat. I wouldn\'t say it\'s very much like rocket league other than the fact there\'s a ball and you have to score in the opponents goal. Still a lot of work required to come anywhere near it. Also at times the ball just flies across the map when barely touched or landed on.',
       'Ok I changed my review from a star to a 2 star, due to the fact that this game is NOT an online game as it misleads you to think. You can turn off your mobile data and the hands still runs without a hitch. They wee so far as to randomize behavior of the AI. By that I mean in done matches your opponents or team mate will just stop, implying an AFK event. Anyway its a fun game Bhutto don\'t be a sham Devs.. Mean what you say and say what you mean..',
       'I think it would be great if the game didn\'t keep freezing on me after 2 minutes of starting it. I\'m sure it\'s not my phone because I just bought a brand new phone and it\'s been brilliant for me in every aspect and all other games are working fine. Plus the phone has a 4gb ram. I don\'t know how much more you might need' ,

       'Good but buggy Good but buggy, one can earn infinite money in no time then u can upgrade ur vehicle to the max in the very first level. That destroys the fun of the game. Second if u have money in millions, the cost of the parts are also in million and so on, and even having millions of dollars in the game u might fail to upgrade vehicle sometimes  that makes no sense.',
       'I really like this game and its one that I can play continuously, my only problem is that I can only play once a day.. the game will work for as long as I play but as soon as I exit I can\'t back on until the following day. It sucks because I have to complete as much of the game as possible in a certain amount of time and that kills the fun. I can\'t just enjoy it and play a bit then carry on playing a bit later.. please fix this I really enjoy.this game and its getting ruined a bit for me...',
       'Yesss. I complete this game in 7 days. I can\'t understand the ending why that cantenar shake. It\'s mean the zombie are in the cantenar? It\'s mean part 3 will exist? Awesome game. I feel happy and relef when I complete the game and go on that ship. I think there will be a helicopter because in start there is a helicopter. But nevermind awesome game. Make part 3. Bye..... And I read there is hidden kits? What is this. Why I don\'t read it before. I can\'t find any kit. But what is kit? Nevermind I completed the game. One more time. Awesome game. Bye.....',
       'I like this game but i faced a problem. When i tried to make a purchase of INR 89.99 for this game,  balance has deducted but no coins or other benefits added in my account.  What is that?  When i searched on google for any helping contact email id or website, there is no email for help.  So tell me,  what should I do? Either solve my problem or i am going to file a case against you. Contact me as soon as possible.',

So goodbye see you when you come up with a better application on earning free clues.üòï.',
       'Hi, Actually, this one isn\'t as much of a challenge as the first Guess the Picture game was and there\'s no point system to make this game as good or better than the first one. I love it anyway, because it stimulates my brain! Thanks, Cris',

      'I used to play this game a long time ago with my brother. I thought since after all these years so many new updates have come, the game must feel different. But it\'s the same. I love the tune that plays as you play it. It\'s so nostalgic. My brother isn\'t anymore with me but playing this game makes me really very happy. It\'s just like I am back in those old days. Specially for me, as it has so many memories, this game is the absolute best.',
       'I have a problem with my account. My punk zombird was maxed out. Level 3. Then when I opened the game, my punk zombird was gone... I obtained that by waiting patiently and gathering 90 diamonds. I had to watch 3 15-30 sec long video for 2 diamonds each. After watching the 3 vids, I had to wait another 8 hours for it to be available again. It took me a month to obtain that bird and then all of a sudden it dissapears?! I obtained it again but I had to start all over again. I uninstalled this app because of that issue.',
       'The game is really addictive. but repeated zombie birds are generated and diamonds are getting wasted. Please change that. One bird one time please. One bird should be at max 3 level not another set. It\'s wasting my internet to watch video to get diamonds for collecting birds',
       'I personally loved this game. First off,  u cant jump for high periods of time cause u to run into the bombs. Secondly, whats sup with these prices? Thats ridiculous. You cant level up with prices that high and u have to buy üíé gems and coins just to get a level up... But tum... Very great game overall.',
       'I love this game cause it kills our time when were bored. Yep, we, my mom also is addicted to this game hahaha, shes always getting my phone and play this game whenever im sleeping. Love it, I recommend this game to everyoneüíñ you\'ll be definitely love this game. MobiGame you slaaaay hahaha',
       'i think it\'s really good every single detail of it is the best only yu should add different zombies that give u power -ups and special effects The next thing is what I said yu should add it into the second one yu could make. The last thing is in the 2 one yu should make it so when an amount a zombies yu get yu get special powers,boost, and cool stuff. Plz make what I just said it would me so awesome if yu did. I\'m begging do it it is my first time ever making a short statement If I misspelled anything I\'m so sorry and for how long this is‚ò∫.I  love this game do itüíñ' ,

      'I would like to have the game on my phone that way i can spend money on the game instead of on tablet as it is more comfortable. The game costs over 3gb! My phone has that but with all the apps that come with the phone that you cannot remove. I have only over 1gb. Sorry wargaming the game costs too much data. Once that is fixed ill change rating given and review. I would play the game if it costed one gigabyte.',
       'It was undoubtedly one of a kind and perfect game at the time of it\'s release. Everything from balancing to controls and gameplay was perfect. Until.....until developers thought of this "awesome" idea of putting it on steam and allowing PC community to play it. The game that was originally designed for mobile users now overwhelmed with PC users. I mean how devs thought that\'s a good idea to compare PC to mobile??? PC players are right now literally annihilating every mobile gamer. We have no chance against them they\'re better in everything from controls to aiming shooting. Once beloved game now lays in ruins conquered by PC community.',
       'This game is great in my opinion. Once you understand how everything works and the techniques while playing, winning becomes more common. My only little complaint is that since the last update i dont always recieve my 10 pieces of gold. Ill watch the 5 ads a day but only recieve 30 or 40 gold total. It would be nice if we got paid the 10 gold after every ad like how it used to be. Not everyone has the money or is willing to spend the money on gold. It would be great if this could get fixed. Thanks',
       'Before update it was easy to play on 100 to 150 ping. It was smooth. But after 4.6 ... It cant be smooth like before. It lags alot...and cant defend myself properly. Barely i cant shot someone with laggy gameplay because of ping. My normal ping is just b/w 100 to 180 ....and i cant get lesser than this. Plz do smthing. #wargaming',
       'This game has great graphics, great controls, great features. Why only 3 stars then? It seems to be so heavily rigged and winning is almost never. With premium account you will advance quicker but i don\'t believe i am alone with my opinion that you will quit this game frustration winning. Since writing and thinking 3 was fair i have now reduced to a 1 as the email sent to the developing team bounced because their mail box is full. Wonder why!',
       'I love it, but maybe the destructions can look a little better how they used to be.  Other than that this game is awesome but i have other ideas of the game and even making other games like this one. Just need help because i don\'t know where to start.' ,

      'Not good enough It could get more better. It actually failed to fulfill the expectations! Not really very fun to play as was written in the description. The game could include a shop to buy things such as powerups or different colours and styles of jetski and some more creative adventures could get the game into a very interesting zone!',
       'Very fun, I love it In this game you can choose your players, Tom or Angela. Then you can ride and you try to get as far as you can throughout the obstacles and challenges. You also try to collect stars along the way. However many stars you collect determines your score. This app will keep your scores and will let you know if you get a high score. When you run into something you have the option to keep going if you watch an advertisement. This app is not boring at all. It works great and doesn\'t take up much space.',

       'Addictive and challenging It makes me put the score I wanna get in mind so I can work towards it and that inspires me to read my books......... If I can determine that I wanna pass my high score who says I can\'t get better grades....... I love the game keep doing  what your doing and make more games..... To everyone  I advise you to play this game üíñüíû',
       'Oh please shut up. It is a very good game and a nice distraction for kids so stop saying it\'s not good enough.  If you are still so sure it sucks then try making your own game see how people reject it',
       'I think that it\'s a great game to play with. they have a lot of obstacles that you can play with and try to dodge them. It\'s also a  score below your score and if u pass it up you have a new high score. if you run into anything you have available options to watch an advertising video or you can press the x. You can also pick which character you want to use if your a girl it\'s most likely to be Angela. And if your a boy it\'s most likely to be Tom.  Yeah it\'s a great game to me it\'s also great for little kids.  It\'s a great game so yeah it should have a high rate at all times.' ,

      'This game has highly disappointed me.  It was super fun and interactive at first then it gives you the option to pay to continue to play or to complete free offers to unlock the game for free.  I have found that you can complete as many offers ad you want but the game won\'t ever unlock and emailing the support web site doesn\'t do any good either. They don\'t ever respond and it is a complete waste of time.  Don\'t waste your time on this game.  Go out and find yourself something worth playing because this surely isn\'t it.',
       'DO NOT DOWNLOAD CAN NOT BE COMPLETED DUE TO A BUG!!!!!!  After buying you eventually get to the accordion level just before leaving the prison roof only for one (or 2 on some phones) ball being outside the play area which makes the mini game impossible.  Many reviews all over the internet highlighting this bug but the developer has not bothered to fix it.  AVOID THIS DEVELOPER !!!!!!!!!!',
       'It was super fun and interactive at first then it gives you the option to pay to continue to play or to complete free offers to unlock the game for free.I tried  to complete many offers such as surveys, installing a playing another game for certain level, but this game never unlocked no matter what! They don\'t ever respond and it is a complete waste of time. This game has highly disappointed me.',
       'On a serious note, you need to give me this game for free. I downloaded and played two different games to get the game for free and 5 hours later I still don\'t have the full game. I\'ve had to install 5 different games just to get this one for free and I STILL don\'t have the full game. I\'m not impressed!!!',
       'Game is ok.  Tasks are sometimes unclear.  After a few tasks you have to pay to keep going or complete some offer.  Tried several times, but never lets me continue.  Should say it\'s a trial version in description.  No clue how it got a 4+ star rating.',
       'Game would have been ok, however I got to a point where you have to either complete an offer or pay to continue with the game. I completed 2 separate offers and was still unable to continue the game, after which I contacted someone about this several days ago and have yet to hear back or be able to continue with game, very dissatisfied. Horrible customer service.' ,

      'I DONT LIKE THE UPDATE THAT GIVES YOU MORE TIME AFTER FORCE OF CARDS . IT ALLOWS PEOPLE WAYY!!!!! TO MUCH TIME TO COMPLETE THE BOARD. AND IT WAS MORE COMPETETIVE B4. I DONT WANT MY RANKING TO SUFFER BECAUSE OF LUCK.  +Ima a REAL RISK FAN. I have purchased everymap package available. Its fair priced and affordable.The new maps are too easy in my opinion. MAKE MORE MAPS I\'LL PAY idc jus MAKE them MORE Challenging',
       'One token per six hours? So you as a content provider only want me to experience three games a day? That is backwards... Do away with the tokens. You will have users clamoring to purchase the DLC if they can play nonstop. This means that you would have zero reason to charge for the premium game. Anyone who has already paid for the premium gets all future DLC for free and the rest of us would be willing to purchase it. This is a great game that could provide substantial income on well placed future DLC and franchise games.',
       'The algorithm used to determine rolls / battles is horrible.  After less than 200 games, I have lost over 20k troops, while destroying only 16k.  That amounts to nothing more than a piss poor design.  Unfortunately I paid for this app, so I am stuck with it.   Game definitely isnt worth the price paid.  Don\'t make the same mistake I made.',
       'This game is great but it could be so much better.   1. The expert AI is too easy to beat. Risk players normally gang up on an opponent, if they are dominating. There should be a legendary option.  2. It would be nice to have a match summary and timeline at the end of a game.    3. There should be an auto-save game feature when playing against the AI, in case the game drops out.  Edit: They seem to have addressed my third point.',
       'This is a very frustrating game. Every single time I play my turn (in a multi-player game that is) I get disconnected! .. and I\'ve to replay it again .. only to get disconnected again! and so on and so on till my time runs out. Sometimes in the middle of all this \'replaying\' I even lose my troops to other players .. VERY FRUSTRATING! And No .. I\'ve both a very good data and wifi connections.',
       'Was fine for a couple weeks.... Then it started freezing up in the middle of my games.... All of them. I\'m using a LG V30+ with 128g ram so it\'s definitely not a lack of storage issue.   I wouldn\'t recommend this app to anyone who likes uninterrupted gameplay.' ,

      'I love this game, it\'s simple and sweet. However, there was a middle row in the item-picking menu in which I had invested many coins into to help me level up faster. Today, when I logged in, the row simply disappeared without a trace. I tried restarting my phone and clearing the backgrounding of my app, but nothing seemed to fix it. Now I only have the Training row and the Fun stuff row. It took me quite a while to get those coins and I\'d really appreciate it if you brought the row back or gave me a solution to get it back. If it helps, you should also know that the \'I\' on every icon which used to let you see how an item was used has also vanished. Please fix this, thank you.',
       'I wish I could give this game 10 stars. It\'s amazing all around.  It\'s adorable and fun. The graphics are amazing too without any glitches so far. Haven\'t noticed any bugs either. The developer\'s done amazing. It does get repetitive after a while but so far by the time it happens something new unlocks so it\'s still fun. Can\'t wait to see what else you guys do to improve the game play since everything else has been flawless so far. Great job, keep up the great work!',
       'This game is super cute! I love my lil ninja friend! Lol. Nice story, and plenty to do to keep you busy. Will def take time to master, but it def has the potential to keep you interested in playing. Even got my wife playing it, and she usually only keeps games for a day or 2, cuz she gets bored with them. I think she\'ll play this one a little longer than most of the other games she\'s tried. I\'m really happy i found this game!!',
       'This one is probably my favourite, with minecraft and clash of clans. If you don\'t have this Virtual Friend game, then it is you who is missing out. Install and enjoy. There\'s nothing bad about this game, and if Naturalmotion do want me to suggest an add-on, then maybe enable me to link the game with a new device. I was LVL 52 once but I lost it. Now I\'m level 17. Hope you liked the suggestion. :)',
       'I really love this game, but if you don\'t put an update on Clumsy Ninja I\'m going to uninstall this awesome game. In the next update will you please fix the part when you touch the story book then it tells you the pictures are still locked? If you put this in the new update anytime, I will start to love this game like I did before. One more thing.... If this helps.... I really really really love this app!!!',
       'You should add a dog and a cat wearing ninja suit they can be like the chicken and the squirrel the dog can run around you and bark and find bones and sell them for coins and the cat can find fish and sell it for coins. It just sounds like a good idea  the dog should be a husky or a smaller dog like a beagle so it is small like the other animals and it can sleep with the ninja the cat can just be a cat please look into this *^* looking forward to this' ,

      'Need to fix......I\'ve beaten every level up to 35 on regular hard and crazy but it glitches while loading level 36 and won\'t play. Plus I\'m fully upgraded and when I have my best ship with my best side kicks all the bullets make the game go crazy glitch and screw up. Please fix for a 5 star.....if not I\'ll change to a 1 star and uninstal. Thanks  They never fixed it. Don\'t bother if you want a game you can complete! Last five levels will not load. So hurting! And best sidekick glitches game play too badly for play at all! üò†üò†üò†',

       'The game is ok. Unfortunately there are freezes that mess up the game and make it really annoying.',
       'A bug is spotted. In endless mode, plane just fly & fly without any enemies. Making it literally endless shooting at nothing.',

      'It\'s a good game.  Three things I may add.  Every so often when you improve a ship , the app goes "improvement failed" yet but takes your coins. Bit frustrating. Secondly, the matchmaking can be at times frustrating too, you\'re getting wrecked in seconds by other very powerful ones.. And last thing , hey , the music of the game becomes straight boring and dull after a while. Add something , anything , Frank Sinatra  ffs , you got about 15 seconds of soundtrack in all this game..',
       'I love this game, i have been looking for a capital ship vs capital ship game for a while and this is s a great game. Its diffiuclt to level up but it is always fun. Although i am experiencing a glitch where my super heavy cruise cannon has been placed in one of my gun slots, and i cant place it back in my super heavy slot. Otherwise great game',
       'The games great over besides the lack of game modes. One major problem I face continually is that people are getting modified versions of the game with everything maxed out. They all go by the name player####. If you could remove them all that would be appreciated.',
       'This game is extremely fun!!! The controls are intuitive, the graphics are quite good, and the gameplay is well designed and shows off unity quite brilliantly. The microtransactions are a bit pricey but they dont take away from the overall fun factor of the game. Kudos to the devs',
       'overall a good game some small bugs to fix like it won\'t let me add my super heavy cannons which is a bummer. and some others would like the creators to fix the problems so I could get back to slaying',
       'I love everything about this game except that the volume controls won\'t stay after I play a match even though the levels are set low the volume is as loud as it was before I ever turned it down... So I keep having to turn it down and down and down till it\'s silent and I don\'t like that. The volume control is bad mainly cause the chat window sound is such a screechingly loud sound. If it was at a lower volume or stayed at a lower volume it would be great.  Also the free kits won\'t open anymore they are always greyed out.  Anouther issue I have is I can\'t find any promo codes for the game, which the game says are available in the community, but I can\'t find them anywhere on any of the pages in any of the community things.' ,

      'This is the best tap games out there. It really loves up to its word saying to timers, unlike SimCity and just about every other game out there. Its easy to play and advance so it sets a wide age range. I would like to personally thank the devs for coming out with this game, something a was looking for for a while. 10/10. Keep up the good work!',
       'Absolutely excellent! I love the freedom of building whatever you like within reason. One thing that could improve it, and it might just be me thinking this, is that the buildings look different as you level them up. I do know that they look different at level 5, but at other levels it would be great, so you remember what level a building is. The idea that each building looks different, regardless of the type of building is still awesome, because it adds a slight feeling of difference and uniqueness. For example, I have come across at least 3 types of apartment and office, so my city/town doesn\'t all look the same. Keep up the good work! üëç',
       'I was very surprised  at the diversity of things you can do. And you can speed up EVERYTHING MANUALLY. Ads are optional with selective rewards of either money or one of the three materials you use to build stuff with. The exclusive currency can be bought with irl money or exchanged for materials or in-game cash. Not like any tap game I\'ve ever played, I\'m very impressed! This is a keeper!',
       'I adore this game, it\'s such a time waster (in a good way)! I wish that the camera controls were compatible with wireless mice. only reason being is because I broke my screen and I can\'t use too much touch screen. :( apart fro',
       'Absolutely love this game, its customisable and you make your city however you want to. One thing I eould like to see is alternative buildings, like instead of a power plant, a hydro plant. Also plz add buildings that can go in the ocean like bridges. Overall love it',
       'It is true that there is no timer but instead your energy runs out very fast! At the end it takes too much time to build a real city!  Also has nothing innovative comparing to other games.' ,

      'Whenever I try to open the app the screen starts flashing black and it\'ll stay like that or keeping turning back to the screen I was on and off, which ends up somewhat strobe-like. The actual game itself is amazing despite having a hard time trying to beat the bacteria level but, what\'s the point of a good game concept, if the game won\'t work properly',
       'I thought the new scenario was a free-trial only like the simian flu. (At least you can unlock it after being a brutal pro at the game) I\'m gonna enjoy playing this a good few times and unlock even MORE scenarios. Keep up the good work! I wanted to make a suggestion, but I just can\'t remember now. Oh well...',
       'Fun game. I wish the rate of death was more consistent. 37,000,000 a day at one point, but waiting 6 months for 100,000 to die towards the end. The disease didn\'t change, the rate of death shouldn\'t decrease just because there are fewer people. Good game otherwise',
       'I didn\'t buy the new plague, i might need to. The first 2 difficulty settings are easy, the 3rd not so much. Good game to me! Just have to read what it is that you spend your DNA points on and you should do just fine',
       'Really annoying ads keep repeating and covering controls.  So annoying. Pity as game is unplayable like this. It never used to happen before. Why can\'t developer just charge for extra content rather than make game unplayable. Will have to remove.',
       'Awesome game! Very addicting! You can replay over and over and it doesn\'t get boring! Just keeps getting better!  There is no need to buy if you don\'t want to.... Just because you suck doesn\'t mean it isn\'t beatable... You shouldn\'t give low stars because it\'s a difficult game! It\'s very beatable without purchase!!!  5 stars!!!!  Just keep trying!

      'The game could be great if not for the really poor choice of words. Why would you include words such as \'shooting, suffers, fur, sue\'  into a game that is supposed to be nice a relaxing? And these are words just from one of the levels. Each level has some words I\'d rather not read or even think about. Nice pictures and vibe though. Please do something about the choice of words. You don\'t want people think about \'shooting\' if only for a brief moment not in this day and age.',
       'Great game, fair balance of ads. Only thing it needs to mix all the songs thru all levels, as the single song while does hold up to repeat play, eventually gets repetitive. Also need better dictionary because I often play real words and it doesn\'t count them which stinks.',
       'They repeated words a lot. Also, words that exist aren\'t always counted. And some words that were counted in some rounds aren\'t counted for others. For example, ale has been a valid word for most of the levels but not for some of them. When I first started playing, did was not accepted and then became accepted as my level got higher. Sloppy work, and it\'s so frustrating. The level I\'m on right now, for example, is not accepting "wad" "wed " or "dew"',
       'I love it. There\'s only two problems. When you\'re on a streak and you accidentally hold a letter and don\'t make a word you lose your streak, even if you don\'t try to make a word. As well as that, the WORST part of the game is the notifications that constantly pop up even if you turn them off. Seriously might be the reason I uninstall the app.',
       'Several problems with this app, and I see the same complaints I have over and over again. From the first moment, this is not the game I saw in the ad, which looked like mine sweeper. But it still looked like a good word game, so I played for five days. I expect a certain number of ads for a free game, but not every level. The word acceptance rules are arbitrary, sometimes accepting plurals and sometimes not. I\'m pretty sure "legs" is a word. Sometimes does not recognize other actual words, most recently "stork." Frustrating, notifications constantly, uninstalling as soon as I finish this review.',
       'It\'s a great game but cuts out a lot which means I lose run of points. It also doesn\'t accept all correct words which means  I lose bonus points.  Can you tell I\'m competitive lol.. I also think that pressing on one letter by mistake should be counted as an incorrect entry.  You end up losing your run of scores.  The most annoying thing is that the light bulb clue icon is right next to the letters so sometimes you end up wasting coins by pressing on it by mistake.  Maybe there could be an \'are you sure you want to use this?\' When you press on hints.' ,

I don\'t have a clue why they made this game when it is this horrible. I don\'t recommend this game at all. My rating will say 1 star because there isn\'t a 0 star option. My true rating is 0 star.',

       'It was hard to use in general and the graphics a bad. I wish it was more realistic. You don\'t even really get to choose where you cut.',
       'The worst game ever! When I tried to touch the scissor\'s several times it wouldn\'t work! I RECOMMEND YOU TO NEVER DOWNLOAD THIS APP BEACAUSE IT\'S A WASTE OF TIME!!!!',

      'It\'s like Cooking Mama from the Wii, but you don\'t have to be accurate at all. There are SO many ads. I mean... They send you an ad like every 30 seconds or so! It\'s a lot. Good game four a you get crowd I think I because it\'s not really a strategy cooking game where you have to time manage and things. It had a decorating feature that I think kids would enjoy. Also, with that feature, a tablet would be better. Or if on a mobile, a stylis.',
       'Most of the things r automatic so I rate it 3 or 4 stars. Pls guys pls,pls I want u to make it nonautomatic so that we can play it properly .that\'s all I want to say about this game and most and things are locked these r the two things which I did not like about this game. So guys pls make it properly. Then I will rate it 5 stars for sure. One of the best game I have ever played. Thank u so much',
       'Nice game... everyone who love cooking should download it. But there is only one problem that the things which are the main are locked and we have to pay the real money or watch s 40 ad. For ex:- In the doll cake we don\'t have the doll so how are we going to bake it.Please fix this problem, otherwise the game is nice.',
       'At first, I was pleasantly suprised this came from TabTales. The lack of pay walls at the beginning is wonderful for their games. Though I\'m not very creative, the game demands it for making food. The graphics look great, gameplay is realistic. I was sad to see a paywal at the princess cake though. If you have 10 dollars and a young girl who loves to cook and bake, by all means buy it for her.',
       'This game is awesome!!!! It makes me go hungry every time I play it!!! The graphics are awesome and very realistic. I luv the fact that it is automatic so you don\'t have to waste your time in perfection... Please keep it automatic like this forever. P.S, for those who are worried about unlocking other stuff like the princess cake, etc. Well, don\'t be, you will get a chance to play it when you unlock the other new bakeries and when you also compete in the competitions.... üòâ',
       'I love the game but it\'s not free.. I\'m not paying for the game and buying money through out the game... Pick one ppl, If it was 5 dollars less count me in but 10 no way! Sorry uninstall ed maybe when I check in again it will be free LOL' ,

      'Its a good game up until you play on anything other than normal. The upper difficulties make it impossible to progress past spartans unless you buy gems and get power ups, smh',
       'I love the game but its frustrating when you have all 8 Spartans and the sword guys get in the way so maybe an extras set of controls to control where your men start or something. Also for me the screen keeps jumping I try to look at enemy and I catch a glimpse but then it jumps to my side then back again and again and again please fix this.',
       'I wish there were more commands. Like maybe you could command the miners to garrison while the rest of the troops guard. Also, redesign the swordwrath helmet. It looks like someone spray painted their hair gold and then glued jewels on it. I also wish there could be more types of zombies. The idea of endless is cool but please add the zombies to the campaign.',
       'It\'s nice how you\'ve mashed together Stick War and Stick Empires together to make this masterpiece. I know its only meant to be a remake of the original Stick War, so I shouldn\'t expect too much updates, but it would be cool if there was multiplayer on Legacy. Keep the games coming!!!',
       'This is one of the most awesome game of all time and thanks to the creators you can play it on mobile too. But it still lack some awesome components, 1. Add Chaos Empire, 2. Add multiplayer!!! Overall still AWESOME!!!',

You won\'t be racing against the time, so be a careful and thoughtful constructor.You will design and construct increasingly elaborate bridges across four varied locations. Each one is a different logic puzzle for a thoughtful builder. Things may seem easy when you start out in a city, but once you move to the canyon, valley and finally mountains it will get hard.

      'Boring and repetitive and poorly designed. The obstacles are hard to see. After starting a (new) stage, you don\'t have enough time to avoid the very first obstacle. The rooftop stage is unfair, you cannot avoid obstacles because either the controls don\'t work or because you don\'t have enough reaction time. And restarting from the beginning gets very boring very quickly.',
       'This is a good game and would be great if the controls would respond every time.  When you are playing a game where responsive controls matter, having them fail about every 20th swipe is unacceptable.  The other disappointing thing is that Batman is the only one that says anything.  I worked my way to get Robin and when he didn\'t say anything, I was completely turned off from the game.',
       'This app won\'t load at all. My son really wanted to play it. He was very exited only to be very disappointed.  I tried deleting and downloading it again but it still did the same thing. I would not recommend this app because all it does is disappoint.',
       'Love batman, I live for anything lego... this is an utter failure. The first level is beyond difficult for a seasoned veteran. Game to difficult, plot line staging is beyond negligent and shame on the creators for designing such an impossible game to progress through.',
       'we love the game but it stop working time to time it starts over and closes by it self. doesnt let us report it. would love for you guys to fixes it. our five year old loves batman games. and this one makes his day.',
       'It wouldn\'t even load past putting in my son\'s age. He is very disappointed. He earned the game and I uninstalled a bunch of my own apps to make room for the app.' ,

      'I can see through the map in several places and the Enemy and the map itself is very Glitchy.   There is an Extremely annoying rooster crowing throughout the entire gameplay and yeah I could just mute it but why? I shouldn\'t have too!!   Then you can hear when an Enemy sneaks up behind you.  I had an alright time playing it but it\'s Definitely Not a game you\'d wanna spend money on, at least not THIS Version anyway!!',
       'Too many ads. I just downloaded n was very happy to check this out but first thing that came on my screen was advertisement. It\'s sad that even after so many feedbacks given for excessive advertisements still developers are running with it. I\'m uninstalling this game n not recommending anyone to try it unless you want to watch commercials',
       'Certainly has some potential if developed a bit more.Only played 1st 2 missions which were over in less than 30 secs considering Its only a small game. The AI is not good nor control system that great. Still be nice to see what looks like improvements after a few updateds. Keeping a lazy eye on this:-)',
       'Way way way to many ads. If you want to exit, you cant because an ad keeps popping up. After every mission or round an ad pops up. When you want to change a setting, an ad pops up. Could ne great, instead its the definition of a sellout',
       'Great game.... but difficult for controle on himeself during shooting  you can get killed during shooting by enemies if you will not move to and fro...',
       'Guys let me tell u how to crack every level if u sit down in the game i mn the shooter sits on the knees it can reach every enemy without being discovered coz u can get close to them as much as u want and will not be able to ahoot the player once also. Ur lifebank will be full. Also developers should update the game due to above lacking..üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇ' ,

      'One of the best wwe games.. even better than immortals.. the difficulty level is always fair when competing with online rivals... gaining loot boxes is also perfect and  not very difficult... I obviously made some In app purchases so I could compete well... just wish to open a loot box and get 1 four star wrestler... things would get awesome I don\'t mind paying for it as well..',
       'STRENGTH : Nice game, wonderful graphics and commentary, great feature of versus and events mode. WEAKNESS : I have spinned loot cases many times but I never got a good superstar. So, purchasing a superstar by using gold or cash should be replaced instead of spinning. Another issue is we cannot remain as a wwe champion as there is no race for championship. Entrance should be added like wwe 2k has done.',

       'This is so conniving at times, when opening a briefcase you time it perfectly and the game suddenly changes the order of the rewards time and time again, so instead of the wrestler you would of landed on you end up with bloody big e for the 20th time. If you want to make it harder up the spin speed but this feels like being actually robbed at times. Poor practice, shame on you!',
       'Game is good except for one thing. You gotta fix the "Versus" mode. How is it "fair" for me to be level 3 but for my first match online be put up against a level 12?? Makes no sense. Should be match making so you match up with someone close to your own level..',
       'Love the game play, how ever the event cases and daily cases play you, I will stop it so it lands on a susperstar and then all of the sudden there is keys in between the superstar it should have landed on. Super shady. So because of that it\'s only a 3 star. C\'mon now...if someone is good enough to stop the wheel on a superstar don\'t play them.' ,

      'Amazing game, great time-killer. I discovered a game breaker: if you go into the settings after you die, the number of coins you got in that level, the number in the brackets becomes equal to the total number of coins. Keep going back and forth into the settings, and the game will eventually ask if you want to triple the coins by watching a video. Instead of tripling the number of coins you got in that level, the number of total coins you have gets tripled.  Instantly triple your wallet every run.  I want the devs to see this and see if they can patch it because I really like this game and I want the coins I earn to be legit.  Thanks for your time, Mike C.',
       'It has a progression system, but it\'s completely worthless. The only reason to try to win belts is to get weapons that serve no purpose. You can win most of them by paying 200 coins and getting a random one, but you can, for some odd reason, get duplicates. Not to mention the fact that coin combos actually do nothing, not even useless cosmetic items, nothing. I think adding function to the weapons (e.g. Making long swords slightly longer range or making small weapons quicker) could add more depth and more of a reason to play the game. Overall: It\'s a good timekiller.',
       'Great game. Best for killing time. Great concept. Need to add a  counter for counting the number of people killed, otherwise awesome. Also there is not much incentive to play to win belts. Make playing with boss again free. Add new opponents (not bosses but the minions) . Make the game a little less challenging. Also remove the brief stun completely',
       'Really fun game. Nice graphics and simple controls. More depth to combat system would be nice. There is no point in achieving coin combos. It does not affect the amount of coins won. Add a multiplier for coin combos, as well as a score multiplier for chaining combos together without missing enemies or coins. Don\'t allow duplicate items to be won. Very annoying to grind and grind for coins, only to get a duplicate you can\'t do anything with. Lastly, an option to pay to disable ads would be nice.',
       'The gameplay is super fun till i got imposible mission "19 coin in one game" seriously? I\'ve try to complete this mission for  hours and always fail So in the next day I play to see if the mission has reset, and its not -_- i mean at least give us mission reset..',
       'Need to fix glitches in the lunges. Stunned when picking up a coin or going through it in to a enemy when instead of stopping. Random stuns even you have a successful strike. And you need to put more green and red guys in sooner. Also theres a glitch where the black dot turns grey and you strike but its too early.' ,

       'Enjoyed it at first, and short adverts were expected, but recently adverts have become longer, and now last longer than the game. The latest video advert lasted inbetween games lasted 8 mins....ridiculous!!!. I understand the need for adverts, but if you can\'t play the game, the adverts are pointless, espeacially if it makes players quit.',

No, need to join the T Club (who comes up with this) and pay an ongoing fee. It\'s TETRIS from the 80s, EA must you milk everything. Nothing is sacred',
       'Trying to play Tetris with these abysmal touch and swipe controls is an absolute abject mess. Just add some virtual buttons in, since your loot-boxing asses are supposedly so focussed on \'player choice\' lately.',
       'Great game, but there\'s an annoying window that pops up everytime I try and start a new marathon. The window is pretty much useless and wastes my time. Would give this 5 stars if it gets patched',
       'Since you really really want a review, when I adjust music and SFX to minimum, I expect no sound at all. Please allow for sound to be muted. Very annoying to have button that serve no purpose. Sure you need ads to survive EA big company like you, go ahead but you want to play the ad with sound over what I have playing that\'s annoying enough, at least optimise the sound so that it doesn\'t play at max volume.' ,

      'Some observations: ball does not rebound off rails as they should, especially the back and side rails near the hole, where the ball hits the rail and stops dead. Part of miniature golf mastery is using the rails but not in this game. And when the ball is against a rail a shot is allowed as if the rail was not present. After a shot the screen should automatically rotate close to what the next shot would be expected so as to minimize manual rotation. I was making a long swipe to rotate almost 180¬∞ and my finger hit the power slide and an errant shot was made. Most hills are not smoothly sloped but instead very angular. Hitting the bottom of the slope causes the ball to jump in ways unanticipated rather than roll. This is golf, not basketball. I uninstalled the game because it just wasn\'t as fun and realistic as I had hoped.',

      'I absolutely love this game (app)! My Mom and I live in different cities about 3 hours apart... we both play, ok maybe battle is a better word!! We battle to take the lead and to see who has the most chips! It\'s a fun and exciting way to keep in touch with her. Thanks for this game/app!!  Sincerely,  Long distance daughter & Mother ü§ì',
       'I hate this new app. Cost to much to try to win extra chips to continue to play the so I don\'t get to play it as much as I use to I hate the new update additive but can\'t losing interest because of the new up date can\'t spin the wheel very much to try to win chips or powerup\'s because lowest amount is 200 coins instead of 100 coins it makes it less adicitive losing my interest and I\'ve been playing this game al very long time!',
       'I  like Bingo. I don\'t like all the ads! If you want me to click on an ad I would appreciate  something in return, like credits or coins. There used to be an option of buying 3 power ups for 500 coins, now I have to click on an ad. Or buy 4  FOR 1000 COINS.  I ALSO NOTED THAT YOU ONLY GIVE BONUSES AT NIGHT, . People like me also play in the daytime.',
       'Unsure as of yet. Will update after playing for awhile Update- I enjoy this game. You do have to spend money to get everything out of the game. But, that\'s how you support the development of apps. I dont like it when you can\'t use your power ups and are forced to buy more to get the special ones. You also have to buy hours every time you play for auto daub. Very difficult to win otherwise.',
       'Fast paced game and love it! Chances to keep getting extra coins and bingo credits by watching the short video or I found out by playing lower levels you had completed to play them again to get more of what you need! The higher levels you go you need more bingo credits so this works to your advantage! Great game and love it!',
       'Loved it before the update, now it tells me I missed a few, but it won\'t let me daub the numbers. I\'m trying like hell to daub, but it lags and even stops calling numbers then it calls 5 or 6 numbers in 2 seconds. Go back to before the update.' ,

      'Great game, Love it! Very creative, fantastic graphics. Not so difficult or loss of life\'s to where you can\'t even play.  Yet still challenging.  Only negative is lots of ads. Would gladly pay nominal fee to get rid of them.',
       'A truly fun, interesting & free game. A good game for any age. If you need to do something relaxing, this is a good way. You\'ll get hooked!!! I\'m in the 500\'s & it\'s still fun! The ads only require 1 more touch on the screen than you have been doing. Well worth it.',
       'I really like this game but newer version I have updated to after 3 months and I see the Hooray Sound in the end and some more sounds in between has been changed to Ticking kind of sound.   I seriously and kindly request to the developer to restore those sounds which were there in old versions because I seriously loved it. I wish those sounds can come back which makes the game more amazing.   And ofcourse I still continue to play this and have hope for those sounds to be back.',
       'It\'s a cute game BUT there are way way too many ads compared to any other game, I understand that they have to make money and that ads are a must on free games but 3 and 4 ads  every round of play (5-7 seconds) is over kill, uninstalling now',
       'Game is fine, ads are fine and can be avoided by not opening chests (not really needed to beat the levels) I\'m really hoping they increase in difficulty though, on level 50+ and that all seem to be fairly easy.',
       'Love it !!! Caught my eye when I saw "pick 2" vs. pick 3. I\'m a stay at home mom kids in school 6 days week that gives me time to burn   (lol) They did a couple small tweeks which  made the "typical pick 3 concept"a thing of the past (FINALLY) BUT WAS ENOUGH change to make it a keeper' ,

      'If there is anything that would make me quit playing this game, it would be ads. I don\'t mind ads but ads are just way too much and take away the fun of this game.  Apart from that game also freezes sometimes and there are some glitches too.',
       'Great game. Only after the latest update, it stopped registering my race wins and best times and although I did win many, they\'re not marked with a star and I can\'t move any level up.',
       'Really fun game. Lots of levels. Really like tournament and duels. I feel like there\'s some cheating in the tournaments. When I watch the videos some people seem to not be touching the ground. That\'s pretty lame. Other than that great game',
       'Fun...until you had to beat an opponent to proceed to next level. These opponents are too much of a jump up on the difficulty of that level. So can\'t pass...no longer fun...uninstalling',
       'Have a problem touching the multi-tasking button Wichita spawn commercials while I\'m racing. And it\'s my favorite game. Thanks',
       'That\'s crazy you allow hackers to have the highest score and also show the video. Say that person isn\'t cheating and I\'ll show you a video where he shows how he does it. A-hole.' ,

      'Such a bad game. Nekki never gets enough of money so they show ads nearly after every fight. You can\'t earn gems from watching videos as it\'s never available. Tapjoy offers have been completed, but never awarded. All the weapons gets worser as you level up. Nekki wants you to BUY the good weapons. Bad game. Shadow fight 3 is worser than this one.',
       'The AI spam SO much! All they do is throw a suriken at you till you die. They won\'t even let you get up! 2 hits and I die yet I hit them like 10 times! There should be unlimited energy who wants to spend $20 for unlimited energy. Plus the controls are trash.',
       'Challenges ruin the experience. Mandatory in order to progress and level up. Some challenges are just ridiculous, and frustrating when you\'re given five tries and having to watch a thirty second ad to get one back every time, even if you make a simple mistake. Other than that it\'s good.',
       'This is a fun action game! I\'m so addicted to it right now and I\'m completely hooked into the game\'s story. The fight animation is just brilliant, unique moves based on real martial arts, fighting styles that vary with each weapon, beautiful background locations, exciting music! It\'s perfect!',
       'Let me just say I don\'t mind a challenge. But the first boss fight is ridicoulous. You need to be lvl 7 to do anything. I would not have a problem with that but you have to farm survival mode to get lvl 7. No problem right well no there is a problem you get 2 xp for beating survival 2!!!!! And you need 400 this is freaking ridicoulous. Plus when you get lvl 7 he is like a regular oppenent. The difference between 1 lvl should not be this high',
       'As much as I like this game, the final boss is unnecessarily difficult. Seriously, what were you thinking when you came up with it? And the game crashes more than I\'d like. But the game is really well done! Flaws and all, it worked out well. Nicely done.' ,

      'This game is fun and entertaining and time will pass by you playing this. The only downfall is you only get so many chests locations on main screen and take hrs to open them up. So you have to decide if you want to play or wait the hrs. You can free up those chests by using your gold that you have but if you run out then you have to buy more with real money.',

       'Would be nice if I could actually get a club that can get a hole in one on a par 3. I\'m pretty sure nearly all par 3 mini golf courses we play in life make it possible for an ace. A little disappointed this game doesn\'t give the chance',
       'I was really skeptical about the quality of this, all other mini golf games I\'ve played have sucked honestly. But wait - this is actually a good game! Kind of rips Golf Clash off a touch design wise but who isn\'t copying everyone these days? Remember the Flappy Bird fiasco and the 500,000 clones still on the play store? Yeah, not going to complain about this game lol.',
       'Was 5 star game! But losing connection is a joke! My connection is excellent! 2 xbox 2 PlayStations play multiplayer online all at the same time! Yet this game loses connection as I\'m about to win! Yeah right! Nice try fkrs',

It\'s fun af but I can\'t even play for a minute without the app stopping. Y\'all can download but 2 minutes from now ur gonna say "dang he told me so"',
       'Constantly force stopping. Cannot finish a game without the game closing on me.  Update: uninstalled and reinstalled game and did not fix the problem. Uninstalling until game is fixed. Other then that game has potential.  Update 2: after installing the game again, it finally worked. But now I\'m uninstalling the game for good.  After scoring over 7b points in 1 game, the game only gave me just over 2b points. Game is garbage. Do not download this game!',
       'Update 2/20/18: the game had an update again and now created even faster than before. It was 90% unplayable, now it\'s 100% unplayable.  Over a week after my initial review the game is still broken and has not been updated.   Loved game for the first week or so after I discovered it. Now it just crashes constantly no matter what I\'m doing in the game.',
       'The game is fixed so you can score more than 2.15 billion.  But you can bank anything over 2.15 billion still.  So I just wreck once I hit the 2.15.  About to uninstall unless the code is fixed to keep all the points you score.  Game is very addictive.',
       'Ok so there are two ways to fix the crashing and frequent ad problem. Simple way, just turn off your internet while playing. Second, disable the internet permission from app settings for permanent fix. No crash, no ads just a fun game. :-)',
       'Seems like it\'d be fun and addictive if it would stay open. It constantly stops and closes in the middle of playing it. I\'ve tried restarting my phone and uninstalling it then reinstalling it, but it still happens.' ,

      'First off, they obsessively ask you to rate the app which I did not like at all. Secondly, the in-app purchases doesn\'t translate to other devices downloaded in the same account so be warned. Thirdly, the gameplay was nice enough and everything else.',
       'I really like the game. I got hooked on it. I didn\'t like that I had to pay to unlock the other levels especially since the game was so short. I passed every level within 3hrs. It was daeasy and fadt. Wish there were more levels. To unlock the levels it was kind of expensive.',
       'You should be able to earn what it takes to up grade.. You don\'t get very far in the game to even see if you really like it.. Your just stuck',
       'I HATE THIS GAME note that in levels  there is abog michine in that they tell to buy it if we didn\'t  buy it we can\'t go to other levels...... When we start the game one add come every time ... üò†üò†',
       'I love this game I love this game and I\'m a boy wow this is so cool like there\'s no like ads and it\'s crazy how it is like you can make lots of treats and you can tell the customers to come up and get their traits and the love it I\'m sure can tell them to come get the tree and they\'re really loud seriously they\'ll be the best traits that ever tasted',
       'For anything over the basic you have to pay for it. Even after getting 3 stars on everything to go to higher levels you have to pay that\'s ridiculous. ..' ,

Often loud vidoes wasting data. I do not recomend you download this blatant addware app. Its fun and novelty quickly gets replaced with advertisement. And you become a monkey watching adds rather than participating a very simple game of would you rather.',

      'Very realistic and nice game. Missions and descriptions are entertaining. Controls are also great.   Can u add more weather effects and timings like sunset, rain, snow etc. The wipers lie unused in cockpit! What abt adding lights to airplanes -nav, position lights? Some real life airline like texture could be added to make it better.        Overall, one of the best bet for airplane enthusiasts!',
       'Well, THAT. IS. AWESOME ! I suggest to continue developing this game...that about multiplayer mode? What about if you can get money from flights , to buy new planes ? That about making new aircraft types? For example: very big planes can take more passengers to get more money but have low speeds? And other planes which are fast but with less passengers ? And best of all, why not if there is a big map which many players (about 1000 maybe) can buy airports , and transport people to different players airports? Please try and make at least some ideas into ACTION! (Not kidding, this can make the game a blast!) .......I am also sorry for people who find this hard but with some practice you can be an expert!',
       'Its quite good but a little bit of fixing will do. The part "Slow Down thing" can you please please place that where it can not block the view of the player. It is very difficult to see whats behind it so it causes us players to crash. T.Y',
       'Great game but more issues to address.  The longer flight durations are a real waste of time,  make them more challenging rather than waiting for the destination. Also add more controls as the ones we have are not effective. How do you tell me to slow down yet i don\'t have the option for that?',
       'Why the hell they add brake when we cannot see the brake option even after landing which forces us to crash. Total stupidity do not waste time in downloading. Previously was better when there were no brakes just reverse it and stop or keep brake button always active.',
       'Its really boring... You have to do missions you cant just fly around and do whatever you have to fly through the squares and make it to the end... And who wants stripes?! Why are they so important?! Plus its really hard to control!!' ,

      'Plain and simple it has no stability, keeps rejecting logins, no trust whatsoever in the bidding process, utterly disgusted and sick and tired of getting emails to confirm codes, and answering to security questions. Not even pay pal bothers me that much. Needless to say my home bank app. Shove this app.. üëÜ üçë',
       'A very very important app for its portability especially for market trading and the SBCs. Unfortunately as important as it is, eventhough the app is very useful, convenient and pretty looking, the difficulty for you to login every time alone has killed all the good things that comes with it. I literally have to update the app by uninstalling and reinstalling at times to be able to login again. This is bizarre, this is horrendous.',
       'I haven\'t been able to log in since the app for 2018 came out. I\'ve updated and reinstalled but every time I hit the login button, it\'d send me to a webpage that doesn\'t exist. For a large company like ea, this should never happen despite their known reputation for zero user support. But this is absolute basic and they cannot deliver! Useless.',
       'Very good app. But always telling me that there is a problem with connecting to the servers but my internet is perfectly fine. It would only work if I delete it and reinstall it. And I have done that twice now and still no change. Please fix this and I\'ll will rate it 5 stars.',
       'Terrible. Made few signings and did not appear in transfers to collect my players. That was like after buying five players and i realized it. I think it works only if u buy player one by one and send to club. Wasted my coins.',
       'When I first installed it on galaxy s8 worked fine but now for some reason the app icon has disappeared, preventing me from opening the app. Now the only way I can open it is to go into the playstore and where it would normally say \'install\' it says \'open\' and this is the only way I can get into the app. When I delete it and reinstall it the icon appears on my home screen for a day or two and then disappears again. Please fix.' ,

      'Love this game! How about pet machine which gives you a random pet when you use it? You could pay 500, 750 or 1000 gems to spin, and it will give you a new pet! There could be 51 pets, 20 common, 15 rare, 10 ultra rare, 5 legendary ones with super powerful attacks and one golden for fully upgrading the safe,pet food, plant and books! Some ideas for pets are zombie, noob, turret from  the portal series, a cloud and mini versions of the bosses! Thanks!!!!',
       'This game is literally the BEST GAME IS MY HISTORY!!! My cousin advertised me and I don\'t believe him but when I watch the ad I wan like that\'s it I\'m downloading this. Now I downloaded it me and my cousin manage to defeat the first boss because without teamwork, no a good idea at all... So download it right now it improves your teamwork ability with your friends.',
       'Soul knight is a rouge-like game that involves 1-4 players traversing throughout multiple floors to reach a stolen gem. Along the way, the players may find a weapon that will lead to victory! Or a toilet plunger that launches exploding S***...a-always a good time... anyway. This game is a mighty good time. Keep up the good work (thanks for the 4 player support ^v^)',
       'Why this would happen!? I can\'t get my favorite weapons in the cellar, what is the point? The weapons include staff of flame, laser sword red, laser, flame axe, and dragon bros sniper rifle. Plz let me get them right away, and this game is cool so i rated it 3/5',
       'Pretty much the only game I\'ve not deleted after a week or so. Had it for over a year and it feels like it never gets old. They\'re always adding new themes and costumes as well as weapons, levels and monsters',
       'Honestly this is one of the best games I ever played. It is exciting, the multiplauer is fun( but needs a bit of improvements ) and the dungeons are always so cool to explore. Sadly, I have a problem that I can\'t seem to unlock badass mode even if I completed the game:( but overall it\'s still pretty good' ,

      'I like the app in all, but I have some points I would like the developer to take into consideration. When a new game starts, it would be better to start with the "mine" option on and not the flag (so that you can open a new tile and not set a flag randomly), even if the flag was the last option used in the previous round. I also believe that in hard mode the game is made too random and not that skill-demanding. Other than these points it\'s nicely done!',
       'I love that this game has been ported so smoothly to the phone. The most interesting part of this game is the ads, or rather, the option of ads. In since this game is free it includes ads, but you can turn them of, or change the kind of ad that you get. For this reason, i actually had the ads on, because i think the developer deserves the money he/she gets from choosing such a great system. Sadly i cannot speak for everyone. Good game.',
       'Pretty good, would like a little better graphics though, and sometimes when I go to hold it registers as a tap. Maybe it\'s just my phone. Also I\'m not sure how close it is to the PC version (scale and such) and would like it closer. But I know its hard on a phone screen. Maybe if you made the rotation horizon, you can match the PC layout more (with the different sized boards that the PC version has)',
       'Overall the app is really great. It\'s the same concept as the original PC version with just some slight changes to make it work for a touch screen. The only downside is that since you\'re not playing with a mouse you have to click a button at the top of the screen every time you want to switch between planting flags or revealing spaces vs using the right or left mouse buttons. But I see no way around this on a smart phone or tablet. Also, there are very minimal ads, which is awesome.',
       'One of my favorite games ever!  I am glad to see it available for my phone!!!  However:  I do not like the constant switching between marking a flag and clearing a space, because I keep blowing up mines I am trying to mark, from being in the wrong mode.  A tutorial to explain the settings and the flag/clear switch would be nice.  Using a long press to flag a space and a tap to clear it would be even better.  I would like to be able to set the bomb number myself.',
       'While this certainly is minesweeper, there are some serious design flaws. First off, when you click the first cell the board does not seem to generate around that, meaning that 80% of games on medium you will loose randomly opening squares trying to get a start. Hard mode is literally unplayable, as the mines are so dense it turns into a guessing game. There are better minesweeper apps out there.' ,

       'Love the concept but ads after every round? And to make it worse.. Bloody too blast ad 4 in a row. Lower  your ads, get rid of the too blast ad and I\'ll uprated 10 fold. Also you could make the game better with a timer ;)',
       'Since the update on the game I can not get the ads to go away. You have to completely exit the game then go back into it in order to go to the next level. Little frustrating, aside from that I really enjoy the game itself.',
       'I think you should have other things in the presents (exp:coins,more hints...) also you should have a time limit depending on what level you are on. And can you please lower the ads.',
       'DO NOT INSTALL!! Way too many ads they expect you to sit through, the ads are way too long, even trying to skip them early takes way too long. Just a never ending commercial pretending to be an app. The developers only want money and ought to be ashamed of themselves for this ad bloated app.',
       'The update is not good. This is not working on oppo. When we trying to open this game. Mobile is hanging and It is automatically close. Before update there is no any problems' ,

      'The gas traps are way to op. No point in trying to get to the cab, when infected, you die in 3 seconds flat, no way to get rid of it. Alot of thief bugs, such as air support doesn\'t called in when used medkits when used are ignored. And about 50%chance it will not pick up cash from a downed friend. Fun game, just needs some tweaking. Update:it wont let you diffuse the bomb on a fellow thiefs back, even if you spam click it as soon as he grabs it. Edit: speed shoes impossible to hit, super fast cooldown. Cheap. Heres an update for you. Later ranks, snipers are dominate. Rifles take one blow to the body and your dead, level ups dont up your health. Not worth it',
       'It like everything else but I hate that we don\'t get gold from anything and that the sniper rifles and that the bags for the thives cost too much and i will love that the cases we get take less time and have even more slots for even more cases',
       'Update: server crashes alot ,its really hard to reach top 3 rank those player aare pay to win player plus the market sucks',
       'This game is so fun, it involves strategy and shooting. Who doesn\'t love those two things in a game!?',
       'i am go to unistall the game bcoz please check me its not possible my ranking is 09 iam in 25 th level and i can\'t shoot bankers  5 to 6 time to kill bankers how can i kill 4 bankers and snipers kill me only one time shoot  how i archive? first place waste of time   & waste of anything. dot reply fast üò†üò†üò¨   Customer care support was not good ...

      'Pretty cool game. Like the simple concept of taking something we have all done at one time or another and turning it into a video game.  Genius. I really like the sense of accomplishment I get when I make a trick shot like a bank shot off the boss\'s head and no rim just straight in! It\'s like he shoots he scores! The crowd goes wild! ..fake crowd roar...',
       'The game makes me feel things down in my nether region super fun to play. When I throw the paper ball I\'m like sweeeeeeeeet. I daydream about playing when I\'m at work. The second I get home I get undressed and play me some paper toss.  Thanks you guys over at paper Toss you really know how to have a great time. If you guys would like to hang out some time and toss some paper I\'d be down. hit me up some time',
       'Wow, this game is fantastic! How have I not downloaded this before?? The controls are easy to use and very responsive. So far I haven\'t run into any bugs so that\'s good. I really enjoy using different objects to throw in place of the paper ball, which is actually my favorite. The fact that each object is affected differently by the fan makes this game flavorful. Really great job with this!!',
       'After the last update the game sucks so bad. Tons of add, lag, the interface moves poorly, after 5 minutes i just gave up and uninstalled it. Used to be so much fun before. Please go back to the previous versiob!',

      'Cutest virtual pet game around! I\'ve never had an app so simple, yet it never gets boring. The controls are simple and user-friendly. It\'s easy to earn money, food and useful items just by shaking trees in the community or watching ads. I\'ve gotten many things from letting my Boo sleep and watching ads, then getting to pick a gift. The customization of your personal boo is also fantastic. Great way to entertain children or unwind at the end of the long day.',
       'This game is really fun and cute!! I love it, its great when you\'re super bored, or something. The only problem I\'m having, is the when I go to change my boo\'s name, it won\'t let me delete any of the letters. Sooo... Yeah, um, other than that, its a great game. Also... WHY NO DELETE!?!? üò≤ plz fix.',
       'I love this app. I have searched long and hard for a perfect virtual pet, and I found it in this cute little game. I LOVE the minigames, and the cute little sounds and faces the boo makes add to the charm of this game. Also, I love how there are a TON of options for customization, and even different kinds of food. I only wish there weren\'t so many ads and in app purchases... Oh well, a little thing like that won\'t stop me from loving this app.  My little Boo is named Marcellus, and I care for him as though he were a real animal. Lol',
       'It lets you change the style/look. And you can name your boo and lots more! I at first didn\'t think I really would appreciate it. It  is fun it is also sooooo cute you can name your boo anything you like l think it\'s the best game in the whole world!',
       'I love this game. It is like taking care of a real child. I\'m glad this is a free game bc now that ik how this app works I don\'t think i would be able to live without. The only thing I don\'t like is how it takes so much time to move to the next level. üíñüíüüñ§üíúüíõüíöüíôüíûüêûüòª',
       'I think it\'s addicting but once you put your boo to sleep you can\'t do anything so it\'s boring after that . But I love mini games! The only thing I can\'t figure out is how to say things when I\'m in the park.' ,

      'Doesn\'t like this new update. It ruin my gameplay. My hired buddies is not working at all. I manually put the toppings on the pizza. I did buy all the upgrades before the update. Now i earn less than before. Hope you bring back the one tap auto  toppings. Oh and I\'m glad that you didn\'t remove the auto slice buddy. It\'s the only upgrade that helps you slice better, not "MANUALLY".',
       'While I was playing, my phone battery died and my phone shut off. After turning my phone back on, I now can\'t open the app. When I click on the shortcut, it opens up a black screen for a few seconds and then exits it the app completely and I get a notification saying "Pizza has stopped" it\'s done this a dozen or so times now even after waiting a day. I would just uninstall and reinstall, but I\'m scared I\'ll lose my progress. If my progress is saved to my Google play account, will I be able to get it back?',
       'This is best game . Simple and challenging. Difficulty is too high but I managed to figure the real answers and it became good ovenist but to arrange the pizza very well it needs artistic skills.',
       'Really bad. Some people don\'t even say what they want. Then complain when they don\'t get what they want. Just like working at Little Caesars.',
       'Game was working fine until I got to day 40. Every time the day ends, the screen goes black, and then the app crashes and I have to do the same day over again. Please fix',
       'This is the absolute best game I\'ve ever played. No glitches and makes you use your brain. I\'ve maybe ever rated a game 5 once before this. This is one of the best games ever. I can even play drunk in chapter one.' ,
    recentChanges: 
      'NEW! Fixed several bugs!',
       'RECENT UPDATES! Chapter 2 with more stories, characters and toppings has finally arrived. We listened to your feedback and double the pizza making fun! Start or continue your master ovenist journey today!',
       'Update now and make some pizza!' ,

Ludo is derived from the game Pachisi. Ludo is also very similar to Spanish board game Parch√≠s.Ludo game has stayed popular throughout the ages, varying only a little in its game structure. This persevering game is now available for you to play in an all new modernized format, i.e. as a video game application.The game is played between 2 to 6 players and you have the option of playing the game against the computer, against your friends, or even against people from around the world. The objective of the game is pretty straightforward; each player gets 4 tokens, these tokens must make a full turn of the board and then make it to the finish line.Whoever gets all four tokens to the end first is the winner. However, each move can only be made based on the number decided by casting a six-sided die, and each token can only move out of their home by casting a six. Additionally, the competition factor of the games is upped by the fact that while moving if another player‚Äôs token lands on the same square as your token, then your token will automatically be sent back home and you‚Äôll need to roll a six again.Ludo King is a game that was once played by kings and now it can be enjoyed by you and your family and friends. While the gameplay might seem simple at first, the game is immensely enjoyable and challenging. You‚Äôll be playing this one for hours and its fun for the whole family. Try to beat your opponents and compete for the highest scores on the leaderboards.Another game similar in structure is Snakes and Ladders.  Like Ludo, you may have played this board game when you were young. Ludo King now incorporates this classic game as a whole new level. The objective of the game is simple: you start on 1 and you have to be the first one to make it to 100. However, you can only move the same number of tiles as the number you roll on a die. The board is also littered with snakes and ladders. If you land on the same tile as the beginning of a ladder, then you can take the ladder as a shortcut and move on up. But, if you land on the mouth of a snake, then down you go to its tail. A game of ups and down, Snakes and Ladders has been a favorite for generations; and now you can play it too, with Ludo King. *LUDO KING‚Ñ¢ PUBLISHING RIGHTS RESERVED WITH GAMOTRONIX',

      'Thank you for developer who made this game. My friend recommend this game for me. This game is really fun, I really enjoy it so much. This game also reminds me about my childhood in the past. Anyone who rated this games below 4 stars are really doesn\'t have a good childhood memories. Keep it up with the games like this. I don\'t care about ads and anything, I just want to play and reminds again about my childhood memories. Thank you very much for create this game and have a nice day!.',
       'PUndoubtedly this is a wonderful and simple game...  Got addicted to it....  I love ur game graphics it\'s simple and superb....    And I would like to suggest an idea....  For suppose if only two people are available to play in a room, then its little boring as rest two slots will be no danger for coins....  For this I suggest if two players are selected then the other two slots should be automatically filled with any other player or computer....  Same with if three player selected....  The other one would be anyone or the computer....  Then all four slots will play and it will be interesting....',
       'I love this game.. I do get addicted few times.. It certainly reminds me of my childhood... i suggest if d admin can put on few updates such as: 1. Showing d coins of all d players on table 2. Transfer options of coins 3.  The option to connect to the table where a online friend is playing and 4. For definitely, you should provide live chat options I hope my comment gets published and my suggestions are taken into account. Thank you so much for this app admin :))',
       'My best wishes to the Game development team. It\'s such a nice peace of work. The game\'s pro\'s makes the game player\'s to get addicted to it. But the cons which I noticed is that, several times due to heavy traffic it shows multiplayer time-out without our knowledge & game in-between stucks randomly making the player\'s win cheaply. Hope if this concern is looked into. Everything will be smooth & awesome. Try to secure the coins earned by player\'s to progress while updating the app & make sure it won\'t be vanished. Thank you!',
       'The game is all nice and good, but with some bugs. Sometimes it is unable to connect to friends when playing on a room. At times the game has connectivity issues and just stalls with no UI notification. Also I\'ve found other player\'s tokens sitting in my house. Otherwise, this is a fantastic game. Would love to see the suggestions by other reviewers implemented.',
       'I love ludo. But i cant play game with my FB friends seamlessly. The app should show which friend is online for play and there should be a real time partner versus mode. Like me and my friend vs 2 others  from any where in the world. This update can attract more players. Dev Team please consider.' ,

      'This is a very entertaining game that is simple to play. It has provided me with hours of fun! The only thing is that I wish there were more combinations, there are things I\'ve tried that you\'d think would make something but don\'t. For example, Crayon (or Pencil, or Charcoal, or Paint) + Paper does not make Art.',
       'Such a fun game!! I love that you can watch an ad to get hints instead of ads just popping up all the time like other free games. I\'ve been a fan since the first one and this one is way better! Cuter graphics and more information about the things you create. Great way to pass the time in a no-stress, purely fun way!',
       'This game is pretty addicting. I get stuck sometimes but I always find something new.  Small issue though, I it won\'t let me pull rust out onto the screen for some reason. I\'ve used it before, but now it won\'t let me use it anymore. Perhaps it is an issue with my phone rather than a glitch in the app.',
       'This is leagues better than the original alchemy game. There were a lot of bugs but they\'ve all more or less been patched out. It took me 2 months of playing everyday to get all of the items and combinations cleared.',
       'The interface is not so good. Big icons are not convenient, we have to scroll down long everytime, I could only imagine how much effort would it take if I had 500 items discovered. Please make icons small or a different tab just for icons or just make it like little alchemy one.',
       'I love this game so much. I\'m stuck on trying to make life but it\'s not frustrating it\'s challenging and I like it. Also, for all the people getting pissed off because the items disappear and you cant \'use\' them anymore it\'s because you can\'t combine them with anything anymore so it is put in your encyclopedia so that doesn\'t waste space for the things you can use, it\'s actually a very smart game mechanic. I\'m pretty sure it even says that in the tutorial. I also like how they didn\'t take the same combination formulas from the first game and instead added new ways to achieve the same product in a more realistic way, also there is so many items to create! So I think that this is an all around great game. Good job developers. Good job indeed.' ,

      'I really do enjoy playing this game. It\'s a great time waster. Good for breaks at work. Public transit. Bored at home. Good graphics. You can choose the controls method. Great car selection. I enjoy it so much, to help the creator I spend a few bucks now and then. It\'s one of the few games I actually play. Just wish there was actual racing. Or if you could have police chasing you, rather than being the police. Either way, good game. Those would be great to implement. üòÅ',
       'THIS GAME IS OVERPOWERD I\'ve been finding a game that is  A Leagend Car game. Then i found this cool game and  I PLAYED IT ALOT. But not forever.   üéµTHE STORYüéµ  When i\'ve played it i saw a !alarm At the gifts then i liked you at facebook Then i subscribed you on youtube  And i liked you at twitter too. Then theres a free luckybucy thing. The free watch and then you will have $500.THANK YOU FOR THE GAME',
       'This game is getting boring. Yah, Next Generation Endless Racing blahblah. But is this all about endless whatever? I think you must put some thrill to this game. This is nothing compared to Traffic Rider which is you also create that game (Yeah. Traffic Rider is one of my fav game.) I HOPE YOU PUT SOMETHING THRILLING LIKE MISSIONS *NOT DAILY MISSION* AND PUT SOME CAR NAMES IN IT. ONE MORE HOPE YOU MAKE THE CARS IN TRAFFIC MORE REALISTIC IT LOOKS LIKE A MOVING BOX... AND I WANT SOME FEEDBACK.',
       'Hello, üòä I really love this game, my favourite actually! I have play a lot of games, but this one is the best so far! PS.:I never spent real money on games! But in this game you don\'t really have to, so it\'s even better for me and for people who can\'t spend real money in virtual things. I know that there are 1 or 2 cars in the game that you can only buy with real money, but it still is a perfect game in my opinion! üòâ',
       'I\'ve been playing this game for a long time on a couple devices and it\'s been a lot of fun. There seems to be some variations in scale of one compact car to another. The models themselves don\'t quite seem to be in scale to each other. You might have two hatch backs that should both be small, even very near in size but when you\'re looking at cars to buy you can tell that the model itself just isn\'t quite the right size compared to other similar cars, and then when you get out on the road with it, it looks bigger than it should compared to other vehicles on the road around it. But.. That\'s not too big of a deal. Great game!',
       'Fun, decent selection of vehicles, graphics and controls look and  work great. But theres a car with no way to get it but paying 15 actual dollars and I hate that. Everything should be earnable even if basically impossible to earn and $15 is alot of money for a single vehicle in a small limited android game. Even the dlc cars in major games like gran turismo and forza are cheaper and those games are way better. That aspect of the game is just confusing is all. Still fun to play.' ,

      'Some of the objectives are impossible complete. Like collecting the snowflakes in the big air. It\'s easy to find them but the locations they turn up make it impossible. And completing the rail slides in the halfpipe... I\'ve done more than enough board slides of every type and it won\'t complete. Still gave 5 stars though. The game reminds me of the original Shawn white pro snowboarding games.',
       'Love the game. Disappointed that after making the quad exp purchase I am sti seeing ads. Kinda makes you not wanna play a game when you realize a developer is only out to nickel and dime customers to death...',
       'So I like the game and I\'ve been playing it for a couple years now ..finally decided to chip in some money for it, but in over a month now haven\'t been able to connect 4 multiplayer a single time. If that was the main reason I had paid money like many or most I would probably be a little pissed off. As it is I\'m just disappointed. Also, I\'m still getting notification ads to purchase the game now for 50% off despite having purchased it already. Other than those issues though I like it, and it\'s way better than all the other snowboarding games I\'ve tried on my phone. :)',
       'Really fun game with one glitch. Great graphics, great sound, really fun gameplay. However you cannot complete all the challenges. So as long as gamification completeness is not your goal and you can leave things showing as 14/15 complete then all is good.',
       'Ok so the last time I uninstalled was because the tutorial sucked and the menu was bad and the controls were horrific. Now with the new update, the same tutorials are finally finishable, the menu looks so much better. only thing keeping me from giving a five star are the controls, too sensitive',
       'Love it. Reminds me of my ssx tricky days, combined with the game objectives of Tony hawk\'s games. Played it once & immediately bought it. Well worth the money, I\'ve already spent hours playing this' ,

      'Great app for everyone!! Doesn\'t matter if you are a casual player or someone who likes to become perfect at piano, you can always enjoy this game.Learn to play contains many classics like Ode to joy,Fur Elise by Beethoven. It also has trending songs like shape of you,Thunder Songs from this town.',
       'It is the best app in the world. No other app of piano can compete with it. I am not a good piano player, but this app helped me to learn songs with ease. There is a few suggestions that it should have some more instruments to make it more attractive. After all, I liked the app very very very much.',
       'The app is very good. The problem is it gets out of tune continually and you have to wait until it comes back, but shortly afterwards  it goes out of tune again. Other than that,it is good. Please fix that bug.',
       'The keys are not synced. While this would be useful if you do not care about sound, or are just trying to download as a time passer for a child, this would be golden, if you\'d like to learn to play piano... Or perhaps write a song... This would not be a sufficient tool to use. The sounds make it confusing and complicated to transcribe.',
       'Revontulet Soft Inc, you NEED to update this game! It\'s had the same songs on "learn to play" for at least two years. It\'s not fun playing and practicing the same songs over again. Please, please, please! Add more songs! Thank you very much :)',
       'Good piano app we can learn to play and we can connent with new frnds all over the world. Bt 1 thing  u must put time when we message frnd ‚ò∫ thank you update  time in chat' ,

      'There was a time when you can still feel the dev team\'s gratitude for you choosing their game. But now, its just one paywall after another. Whatever they used to give for free in the past years, they\'ve found a way to turn into cashcrop. I\'ve never been closer to deleting this game than when the latest update came out. If you\'re not a VIP, uninstall it now. They\'ve made a fool out of us.',
       'I love this game. I truly do. That\'s why this hurts. With the Adam Warlock update, I knew I had to be ready to save up crystals, though I did intend to spend a few for new uniforms, but hiding the one for the update\'s protagonist behind 5.5k crystals is a new low, and you haven\'t even soothed the slap on our faces from the Ultimates\' update. I was prepared to buy a new subscription for crystals or bios, but not anymore.  Netmarble, I thought you better than this. You had a good, committed following, yet you abuse us like this.',
       'An amazingly, beautiful made Game, which is a true gem for Marvel fans. Hats off to you guys. I didn\'t thought that android platform will be that big in gaming areas. I am a Hardcore gamer and i know what gaming should look like...and that\'s what it looks like - Future Fight. I hope you guys will improve the game from time-to-time so that we can\'t get bored of it.',
       'Updates? Updating means improving something, you\'re just digging a bigger hole NM.. I used to spend ¬£10 a month on this, now it\'s not even enough to unlock the new characters... Many of my free to play friends stopped playing, and I\'m 1 update of following them.. Just can\'t be bothered with the grind, and the other option is pumping money into it. That\'s not gonna happen anymore.',
       'Do not even download this game. It is an absolute scam. At one point it was a good game but you will quickly find all the good characters are locked behind thousands of dollars of paywall. Much of the game is based on RNG and so a lot of the resources you can actually grind for go up in smoke. If you don\'t already have this, stay away.',
       'Look I downloaded this game not too long after installation I expect to play the game then I was notified that I can\'t play offline no problem with that but my problem was downloading the update info which also cost 522.36 mb. All this should not b necessary I think it should be like this when downloading the game there should be an additional file which should be the update info.I feel it will be easy for those who are downloading this game (like me) to start the game instead of downloading "update info" before starting the game. And I hope make u of this advice because it will be beneficial for those who are downloading the game and for you.' ,

      'I never had to pay a single cent for this game, and it\'s working out perfectly fine for me. Sure, you can pay for more coins and items to level up quicker - but you can enjoy the game without paying anything. I get raided too but on a fairly acceptable basis. I love this game. Only thing is, I don\'t like my non-responsive faction members and I\'m worried once I leave my faction I couldn\'t join another one. Ah well. That being said, 5 stars for the game.',
       'This game is a treasure! It has kept me entertained for about 1 year and a half so far! I love the story parts and maps and I want to congratulate the developers! Good job, Nice graphics, Great game. Although, I lost my save file because this game doesn\'t make any easy whatsoever to load save files. Please fix that! Thanks!',
       'No one from the support team will respond. My game was unistalled and reinstall and I lost 2 years worth of data. Can\'t remember sync it and I know scopely can do it for me. I\'ve provided everything they need and still nothing via email or in-game support. Will change my rating if this is sorted',
       'Fun and addictive game. New features are added to keep it from getting boring. They do a good job of listening to players opinions when and if something needs changed. I would give 5* but nothing is perfect. Hands down the best TWD game out there.',
       'The last update has caused it to have to load every few times I log in. It takes 4 to 5 minutes each time. Never had this problem before! Can\'t get past prestige rewards screen... I have uninstalled and reinstalled... not happy',

ITS BEEN COUPLE WEEKS AND NO NEW LEVELS HAVE BEEN ADDED, SO RATING IS NOW GOING DOWN. FIX THIS PLEASE! I love this game but I\'m on level 1190 and there is not another level after this. It did this before on a lower level and after a few days there were more levels. I shouldn\'t have to wait for levels to load up or the game itself reload levels.... my husband is going to catch up to me!!! Fix this please!',
       'I\'m not trying to be a hard ass, but I take issue when games like yours automatically goes into a tutorial mode instead of offering it as a choice. It drives me crazy. If your game gave the user the choice of either to use the tutorial or not my ratings would be between 4 & 5 stars.',

      'Had found a phone on the job sight and played the sample version. I HAD to download it as soon as I got access to my own shine. I play constantly!  Haven\'t gotten very far yet. Thing I DON\'T like is you don\'t get an average..... IF you do, I\'ve yet to find where it is in the game. That\'s in NO way a deal breaker. So, GO DOWNLOAD IT!  See for yourself just how additive & F-U-N it is!!! üòâüíØ',
       'Quick fire is the best but theres only one down fall, the seconds. When you get to the last seconds it doesnt give you your last strike and the other person wins.they should fix that.you have to score right on the 2 second count b4 you get ur last strike. Please fix it so peoples last strike can count, thank you, other than that its a great and awesome game to play to challenge your players. üëçüëçüåüüåüüåüüåüüåüüåüüåüüåüüåüüåüüåü...also the developer should add macau lanes, London lanes and pins..',
       'It\'s a  fun game but it\'s rigged. I think if you have a billion chips you shouldn\'t be able to play on lower lanes. I thought you were supposed to be matched up with people who are the same or close level. How is it I\'m bowling against someone who is level 171 and 8 billion chips and  I\'m level 43 .',
       'I have been playing for months and spent a fair bit of money on this app and also was enjoying playing until all of a sudden all the graphics went pink and now i cant play. Not happy!!! How do i fix it? Don\'t want to delete it really as i will loose all my chips and special balls. Someone help please !?!?',
       'Amazing.  It\'s just fun watching the bowling hall whizz by and get a strike.  I\'ve played and uninstalled this game, but the only reason for the uninstall part is storage.  For all of you who are new, try getting the ball between the front pin and either of the pins next to it, it usually gets strikes, but by strikes I mean doubles against level 7 Russians.',
       'I enjoyed this game for over a month and though I\'ve written to miniclip about the issues of a pink blanked out bowling ball and lane, they have not responded.  Ridiculously so, I used to play this game for a couple hours almost every day. I can\'t believe a game so fun that I would play with my friend and family became such a waste.  Fix the problems and the rigging of the game please!' ,

      'Good game, good graphics,good sound. I like that it is on going, not like some similar games. I found it fairly easy to get used too. Plenty of choices and cars. I like that you are not constantly forced to spend real money in order to progress. That is a big plus for us game players. Well done all at EA, you have a real winner with this game. I personally am loving playing this game. Update, I have been playing for a few days now, the only drawback I have noticed is, the game takes up a lot of space on my device. Having said that, its so good its worth it. As previously, well done all at EA.',
       'Excellent game! I have no doubt that the game is one of the most perfect games. Everything but one thing. I just ran one race that comes with the actualization and I won around 5k, te first upgrade for the camaro Nascar costs around 130k does that even make sense. In the real life if you spend that money to make a competitive car to win that money... I hope you get my meaning',
       'Well,to start off, game really speaks for itself.Everything is pretty dope. I\'m just going to name some things that I\'m sure most of the people wants. -Dynamic weather conditions,how amazing snow day on Bathurst would be?Rain,wind,foggy... -Breakable parts, mirrors, spoilers,even wheels,and those should be on the tarmac whole race. -Drift events, I\'m just going to say,we all want it. -More hatchbacks definitely,and more cars like its Jeep,or Ford Raptor,and you can add unique cars from movies,etc. -And sprint events,point to point.How fun is that. -More mountains!!! Please. Peace!',
       'Absolutely amazing game!!! I\'m a huge petrol head and this ticks all boxes considering it\'s a phone game. Love the controls. Personally i use accelerator on right, brake on left and tilt to turn. Feels bang on. Graphics top notch. No need to spend money to progress. Literally one downfall... upgrade costs when you get higher spec cars. Apart from that... GOOD JOB!!!',
       'Great Graphics. Good Game with plenty of new challenges. Annoying things are cars that you pass continually try to run you off the track. Or jump in front of you at the last second when overtaking. Or spin your car 180 deg when you are braking. Or you bounce backwards at rediculous speed if you rear end a car slightly. Laggy online game play. Has periods where the game goes into slow motion at the most demanding part of a race. Sound drops out occasionally.',
       'This game is brilliant. Have been playing it for ages. However the updates are messing with previous games, especially NASCAR I\'ve been playing previous events but with update they\'ve gone and replaced by new ones, I\'ve been working towards cars etc....all gone. Slightly annoying guys. Keep up with the good work etc but leave the previous ones alone please.' ,

       'This game was actually better than I thought. I thought it was going to be one of those stupid games where it has a stupid amount of ads and stuff, but it was quite good. Unfortunately I had to uninstall this game (I\'m sorry Train Depo!) Because it I already have loads of games. This is a good game and I also love the way that you get loads of money when you go to loads of stations at a park. The only thing is I managed to upgrade all of the stuff for the coaster and don\'t know what to do with it. Other than that, it\'s good',

       'It\'s a great game in terms of versatility (as versatile a single game can be) and you can almost always play as there is a table for any amount in the start-up kitty. Like most Android poker games it gives you the option for daily free chips so you can play daily should you wish. Where it falls short is table talk and conversations are extremely limited. I mostly play in bed, at night, until sleepy so table talk isn\'t really for me most of the time but if you are wanting a social chit-chat game this isn\'t it.',
       'Clearly rigged game. It is clear the game is set up to ensure you purchase chips. I constantly lost with cards like pocket ace against 2 and 7 off suit. even if I got trip aces they would get a full house, this is only 1 example. I had over 500 million chip stack and was in league level 14 but Some how lost every single hand I played no matter what hand and haven\'t been able to build a chip stack ever since. This is also not the only review like this  I also play poker at casinos and pubs with consistent wins and leading in a championship seris. I regard my self as a good poker player',
       'Look at your ledger board.. Typically the 1st names are Fake profiles, so you can\'t advance without buying chips to beat unreasonable winnings.. They all have similar stats.. no best winning hand.. no pic.. some have same name or real similar..It\'s obvious they are fake and Zynga has confirmed this, yet hasn\'t removed them.. They continue to allow it every week..' ,

It was a little more than one of my favorite things are not the only thing that you are a lot of fun and exciting. The other thing that you can be used, the New Year to all the way to get it. The 8. The other thing that you have any question\'s I am a little while, and I am, comments, or if 1, I have a great deal. I am not a big deals on a side note ,2nd, and I will be a good 61.

I recommend this game to anyone who gets bored really easy,usually have stressful days and loves chopping people up! üòÇ',
       'It is strange in a way because if kids play this they will be very into it but they should not. It is not a good idea for the kids to have.. TO KILL THE BOSS...? That is not a good massage for kids. But I like it very much but I would not want my kids to play. Please type me back!!! Thank you have a nice day :-) :-)',
       'The game won\'t even start for me. Nobody can argue that my phone can\'t handle the game because I have a S7 edge. But yet the game will not open. Everytime I open the game it says loading and crashes.',
       'I\'m on Galaxy S7 Active, and this app keeps crashing. It may be because I didn\'t allow you to make and manage phone calls, but I don\'t see a reason for it. I completely understand accessing my files, but I would say that allowing you to call people on my phone on my behalf is too far.',
       'Feeling stressed out from daily CRAP...! Take it all out on this game. UNBELIEVABLE.....! I love this game. Great way to work off tension from my day as an executive! Who would have thought I handle tens of thousands of my clients cash dividends on a daily basis and beating up on my boss 2 is the only way I enjoy unwinding from a busy stressful day!' ,

      'Your game is cool and addictive. Just what i was looking for. Nice graphics,decent gameplay,fun racing and awesome rewards. It\'s my favourite game, i play it everyday. But only one problem, everytime it asks to download additional files. I had already downloaded it but still i recive this pop up message. Is this game online ?? If it is then please make it offline..plzzzzz.',
       'Its an overall addictive game but instructions wise it needs to be more giving. You dont really understand whats our task sometimes. Also i think there is a problem with the sensor or something. I mean i do swipe my finger across the screen but the car doesnt move. I have to literally do that twice or thrice sometimes. This makes me lose out. Its not really my phone as everything else works fine.',
       'The update has killed what was a great game. You now can\'t pass a level unless you get 3 stars. Meeting the objectives for 1 or 2 stars causes a glitch, where it tells you you\'re out of time, offers you the opportunity to buy more time (fuel?), or recommends you upgrade your car. The daily log-in prizes don\'t worry either. Please fix it, you broke something that was very enjoyable.',
       'It\'s a nice game to play, i always play with my son.  But do u hv new update on this game? Ive reached lvl100 and my cars were fully upgtaded few months ago.. and it start getting bored already if there\'re no new lvl',
       'The tracks have unnecessary curves that makes the whole game very disorienting when at high speeds. Also, the app seems to not sensing my finger and never switch tracks at the right time. Hope you can improve.',
       'Good for 5 minutes but no more. I was sad enough to get to level 99 but it\'s impossible to complete this game. The final boss is too fast for me having a fully upgraded lightning McQueen.' ,

      'Playing as a Lady/Lord of Westeros, you get to strategically create a powerful house of noble soldiers, attack creatures and enemies on a stunning and accurate map of Westeros and lay Seige to renowned houses and take Seats of Power. Free and pay to play, time is of the essence. Not much of a story, although events give ample rewards and joining a Leige and their bannermen have it\'s perks, like taking over houses with status will give your troop and kingdom a number of buffs.  Not much of a tutorial, apart from basic growth. Maybe give a tutorial for equipping items to your character and how to level them up.  Join the battles of Westeros and survive the winter!',
       'currently cant collect my trained troops so cannot train more. have tried restarting, clearing cache no success. Yesterday i spent 3500 gold on wood and it gave me food. These glitches and others are seriously starting to impact the overall enjoyment of an otherwise good game and i have been playing since beta release. please address as all my tickets seem to have been ignored.',
       'Improving, but still... A pay to play game all the way. Serious issues with notifications ans in game reports (which the game has options to set and therefore should be in top working order). It *is* a war game, being notified lf enemies and being clearly able to predict losses during one\'s own attacks should not be a concern for the players. Losing what amounts to circa 250 thousand of value in ingame gold because of these issues (paid for with approximately 120 ‚Ç¨‚Ç¨) and then offered 18 thousand gold as "compensation for the issues" is tough. Protesting and being granted 25 thousand more for the "inconvenience" is then insulting.',
       'It\'s exactly like Game of War but themed with Game of Thrones. If you liked GOW you will like this game for sure. I am enjoying it, sometimes the game crashes but considering I am using an older phone the gameplay is not bad and with every updates that\'s getting better.',
       'Had to edit my previous review due an automatic answer I got.  It\'s pretty ridiculous the amount of time it takes to open a seat of power and it\'s a clearly pay to win game.  The events aren\'t creative enough and there\'s so many.bugs, the damn game keeps rebooting itself out of nowhere.',
       'I really enjoy this game, it has good graphics and a lot of strategy. However it does have a few flaws, in each kingdom there seems to be someone who spends a ton of money and annihilates everyone else. And then the developers decided to change the formula for how much power the maesters give when you do research. I lost three hundred thousand in power. Very discouraging' ,

      'For anyone saying it doesn\'t make sense - this is a logic puzzle game. You use the hints to eliminate numbers and get as close as you can to the solution. Sometimes it won\'t narrow down 100% and you might have to be lucky, but that\'s why you have multiple attempts each turn until you get a high solve streak. This game is a good time passer and workout for the brain.',
       'Someone reviewed saying that if you have multiple solutions, you\'re doing it wrong. That\'s incorrect. You absolutely can have multiple solutions that fit all given hints, but the game will only accept one. At that point, it\'s no longer a puzzle game, but a luck-based guessing game.

      'Well guys.. I just broke the game üòÇ it was the \'HEADLIGHT\' puzzle where I got stuck. I requested for a hint and I accidentally tapped out the E in it and now it\'s completely gone. There\'s no letter E no more in there. You should check this out. (So I requested a hint twice, went wrong on the word and then tapped E, and poof, it\'s gone) and maybe you should make a reset puzzle button for situations like this. üòÉ',
       'Very easy, boring and full of unskippable ads for no reward. Not a very clever game as some have suggested, this gives the player no sense of accomplishment nor any legitimate challenge unless you do not speak English.',
       '30 second unskippable ad after three easy puzzles... immediately put me off of playing this. In the brief time I played this I spent more time looking at an ad than actually in the game... rubbish',
       'Just got really boring. In a group of 10 puzzles there was; 1 that was a clever brain teaser, about 7 that were just way too easy and severely lacked creativity, and at least 2 that were just genuinely terrible often making little to no sense whatsoever and then it just turned into a game of hangman with unlimited guesses. Clearly this was made by a team or individual who thinks that they are supper clever and witty but in reality just wanted to make a few easy bucks by showering people with adds and a completely unnecessary currency system.',
       'The best time spent by playing this game ... Some are easy, some are funny, some are tricky, some are still out of the mind.... But it\'s a wonderful game and waiting for more levels to come now...',
       'Its a great gane but is always glitching out.For example I have three leters after I use a hint,then I earn a hint and the other letter just disapears and it did not go onto the word or phrase.' ,

      'How does one finish speedrunner 1? I tried purchasing a few upgrades as possible. I purchased 2 money upgrades for Jofu, a speed and money upgrade for Cula and Byldo and the 2 fruit teirs. I can\'t obtain Ony before 11 minutes. Maybe one should set the objective as unlock Byldo in 5 minutes instead.',
       'The algorithm of the AI mode of the worms is somehow amazing. It seems like a game which is not really amusing your eyes but actually has a good algorithm and programming instead. Rather than the usual games that we play, i recommend you to play this and figure out the algorithm. It maybe easy but sounds exciting if you can find it out',
       'Cool game, my only complaint is the camera. I would like a more birds eye view of the game. To me it seems like its a slight sideview of the game, making it hard for me to guess when it will end the game by eating its tail',
       'Great little snake idle game! Only downside is the gui does not scale with the screen. Makes text really hard to read. Ithwr then that, snakes on a farm, play old style snake eat game by choosing your farm. Your oqn upgrades up the difficulty. And each farm can have an ai that can auto control the eating process.',
       'I get it\'s an idle game, but this is as idle as it could ever get, almost "install and forget about it". Out of so many upgrades, only a *single* one is needed: new worm. Nothing else is worth it, new worms give you way too much compared to older worms, making upgrading worms a complete liability. Actively playing doesn\'t reward almost at all either, as the only worm you would control is the newest one, which however will have the smallest field, hence a trivial task and a rather boring one.  The key to idle games is that you gain while not playing but you gain so much more by playing, which just isn\'t the case here.',
