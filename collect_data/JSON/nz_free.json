Being a gangster is just beyond a joke get a job and show The Next Generation how to be an adult and not a man child with a gun',
       'this is utter bullsh#t as it\'s a big disrespect to gang members. Typical bloody social media alway\'s making the gangs look bad, majority of the gang\'s members are people who work\'s amongst the society and that some of the members are qaulified well presented people not all gang members go out killing each other or selling drugs and theiving. No some of those people actually have a life when they not being gangster. Maybe the social media should actually get there facts right instead of judging a person by what they look like...',

But his kids had to see their dead father being exploited on an app just so u could get ratings.. I don\'t agree with the gang life and I don\'t agree with your poor idea of fun',

I think glorifying this is wrong, yes there are some bad members in gangs Some were born into it, but at least they do positive things like work pay taxes  involved in positive community projects I personally have been hurt offended by some, but learned to not put all in same basket. Hope you can show some decency  to family friends you have offended.',

       'I really enjoyed this game and played it often. It\'s fun and that\'s always a definite plus. However after around 5 days of having the game every time that I tried to open the application it would stall and notify me it wasn\'t responding. This was the only app on my phone that had done this but still I restarted my phone and ran anti virus scanners and nothing showed. I checked for updates and none were needed and followed by uninstalling and reinstalling and still the issue remains. Can this please be resolved',
       'Wait I just saw this game on fb ads.. Ive been looking for this kind of game for a very long time.. My friend have a phone sony ericson and it has a game like this and i like it a lot and while growing up I never came across with it until now.. thanks a bunch :)',
       'ok, every time o start this game, some update google play services thing pops up, and i cant close it. when i click to update, it just tells me i need authentication even though ive already signed it, and chnaged a lot of setting stuff, like wth? i hate whwn tgia happens',
       'Great game. Adds are a bit too frequent in free version. Uninstalled for this reason. Devs please change frequency of Adds for better rating. I personally never purchase any App no matter how good if the free version is crippled by Adds. I should be able to enjoy it for a while and purchase to get cool paid only  features!',
       'The Adpocalypse. Open the app; 30 second ad. Play a level; 30 second ad. The levels take less time than the ads. Waste of time. I get games rely on ads for revenue but this is shameful. Other games will give you the option to watch ads for bonuses or to get another life. The level of ads is just too much when compared to the length of gameplay between the ads.' ,

      'This  was really  fun! Starts off easy but gets harder, not near the ads of the  other games I have played. Takes extra words, hints are reasonable,  earning money is reasonable.  So far the best of the word connects !! Really happy with this game, will add to my phone  and get rid of the other word connect games that seem to have ad, after ad not to mention the high amount for hints! There is one reason I didn\'t  give it a 5, because some of the ads get stuck and you can\'t  exit,  overall  4.8!',
       'Child-friendly! And, as an adult? I love how am yet to see an advertisement. 😊  Unlike other word games like Word Connect, it also lets you find and play words that are not necessarily those found on the board, storing it in an "Extra" slot, which generates added points to your score, rather than telling you to choose the word that\'s only on the board.  ADDENDUM: After reading the comments, it appears there may be ads after all. Am yet to see any though. Perhaps because am still in a lower level.',
       'Not a bad time killer - quick paced and not too taxing on the brain. I wish it had a more comprehensive dictionary so you would still get bonus points for valid words like \'cad.\' No matter - still basically a four star, though almost three for the number of ads.',
       'Game is fun. But giving me pop ups to bring me back to the game while it\'s not open is a nono. Especially when it takes up half the screen. I\'d give 5 stars cause i had fun playong this, but this one thing is annoying. Especially with the amount of ads, it shows you just wanna push people to keep playing for that ad revenue. Won\'t be downloading any of your games after i delete this now.',
       'OK, this word game is the bomb! It actually uses words that I know! I have played so many word games that use strange words and won\'t take common words! Thank you, WePlay! I will be trying your other games and telling my friends about them!',
       'I turned off the notifications on this game and it still gives me pop ups that cover up anything else I\'m doing including navigation instructions while I\'m driving.  This is dangerous and unacceptable.  I can\'t be fiddling with a game while I\'m driving in a whiteout blizzard in the middle of the night.  Uninstall.' ,

      'So far so good.  I\'m only on level 12 right now and this fantastic. Kids will feel good about themselves. I\'m hoping that it stays simple for a while longer. Kids tend to have shorter attention spans than adults and get frustrated easier. All in all a great game thus far. Thanks',
       'I absolutely love this game. The graphics are spectacular. The characters well they\'re not characters their cartoons they\'re amazing. And the game is fun. My only complaint is that every level is a struggle to get through and it would be nice if occasionally they would make a few of them easier.',
       'You will not believe what I am about you tell you but this game picks and chooses who to charge for rewards. I have screenshots of my partner\'s game, not having to pay for his rewards and I look at my game, getting charged $2.99 everytime I want my rewards. Its messed up and I have deleted the game.',
       'Support don\'t want to help when you have an issue. Once they reply you don\'t have an option to reply to them, you have to start all over again and it\'s the same reply about back up to Facebook etc, which I did.... level 170 and I had to start again, don\'t ask for help, they don\'t care!!! Better of with candy crush or another competitor game',

       'So. Who wants a GOOD, fun, entertaining game that you can\'t stop playing? You? OK then. This is the game for you. You can win coins for dying, reviving, and playing every day. It\'s easy. My 3 year old brother can play it, but there\'s 1 thing you need to remember if you are younger than 8. DO NOT START KILLING SAUSAGES IN MUMS OR DAD\'S KITCHEN. THERE WOULD BE EXTREME CONSEQUENCES INCLUDING THE HOSPITAL... Have fun!',
       'There is some fun to be had here, if you enjoy constant adds and having some no-win obstacles come your way. I mean really what\'s the point of a game where randomly nothing you do matters and you will die? If they changed it to where what you did had an impact on you dieing or not (at all times not just some of the time) it would be worth playing. Uninstalled.',
       'Complete garbage. The whole game revolves around watching ads. You spend more time watching long ads than playing the game. The game itself is a Temple Run ripoff with 1-tap control. Mind-numbingly boring and the microtransactions is front and center. This game has everything that\'s terrible with mobile gaming.',
       'Love it! Definitely addicted to collecting all the outfits. Although please make it so you can pay coins to revive yourself. I dont like ads which is why i paid for the ad free version. Also it should be like 10 coins 1st revive 25 next 50 next 100 etc...',
       'I LOVE THIS GAME! It\'s so fun. I encourage other\'s to play this game. Though, the commercials are kind of annoying and weird. But over all good game. I\'m so edicteted to all of the different sausages you can be! If you hate this game, You Are Weird. There\'s a point to this game. All of my friends are like there\'s no point. And BLA BLA BLA! I love this game! 😇😀😄😛😋😍😎!' ,

      'I think the game is very well made, though it doesnt have the same feeling as hungry shark, as in when you play hungry shark, it just feels better somehow (at least I think so) and it feels like cutting edge. And also I think ubisoft should add more tearing sound effects, just sounds better...',
       'I love how you optimized the gameplay in this update! ❤ But can you make it a little more smoother for lower end devices? Such as devices with 1GB RAM? Just a little request 😁 I\'m playing Hungry Shark Evo and Hungry Dragon at the same time. Kinda addicted to it both ❤',
       'Great game, loving it so far. Love the offline capability as well as the online! Main concern... the cost of the dragons is insane. Sure, you want people to spend money. But, having to grind 120k coins just to buy the next dragon after I\'ve unlocked it (currently have 105k coins from runs leveling up Fried and just unlocked next dragon) seems excessive.',
       'This game is so much better than I initially thought. The graphics are beyond anything I  imagined, the context of the game is pretty good too. It lacks in some aspects like challenges but it\'s pretty good overall. One of the best games I\'ve played, it\'s quite addicting and chill even. Thanks Ubisoft!',
       'This game is very enjoyable as it is both relaxing and challenging. Compared to Hungry Shark World, even though it is lacking in a few areas, it has its perks as well like the egg hatching system. However, this game should have a few other features such as power-ups. The power-ups should be special and not just be perks that pets or costumes give, for example a pets eat everything power-up? Contests in this game should be frequent but not too much. Maybe one contest every few days? It would also be nice if you had Event prizes and not just have prize currency. Daily login rewards should be added but not too broken like 5 gems a day or something like that. As you progress, the dragons get harder and harder to get, especially the L and XL tiers. So it would be very great if you lowered the prices of the dragons slightly according to the price. Last but not least, it would be amazing if you had to find things to unlock dragons instead of just max levelling the previous dragon, for example you would have to find dragon teeth or claws to unlock. This is only an idea for the future though. Special dragons with special abilities should also be added, maybe a dragon that is immune to toxic cauldrons and flowers, and they even make the dragon stronger. If special dragons are added, then hybridized dragons are the next step. Hybridized dragons have both special dragons abilities combined. Hybridization will be able to be done 2 ways: 1. Both dragons have a dragon egg and it hatches once it is incubated. 2. You can buy the special dragons again and fuse them together in some sort of hybridization chamber, however if you only have 1 set of the two, you give up both of them and you have to buy them again to use them. As I feel that when you buy dragons, you buy them from some sort of creation lab, idea 2 doesn\'t seem too crazy to me. I would also be excited to see the hybridized dragon\'s look. Taking another step, you can hybridize hybrids, however it could get too overpowered as you would be able to make the ultimate dragon with all abilities. Not all \'dragons\' must be actual dragons. There could be Griffins or other creatures in the game. Adding new maps is not a first priority as the existing map should still be improved on. Anyways, what I\'m trying to say is you should add features akin to Hungry Shark to help players from the other \'Hungry\' games adjust to Hungry Dragon. If you have read this, thanks for reading!',

      'Thank you for constantly improving the game. Id say at this point not to add more but to fix and adjust what you already have. Fine tuning before more additions would be great. Optimizing sounds, movements, vehicles, rendering, scoping, responses, all that good stuff would be great. Its a little laggy but thats just what you get for a giant game and 100 million+ players. Love it either way.',
       'Fun game, especially since it\'s free. But I saw that this game supports controllers so I tried to use my pro switch controller with it and so far only 2 buttons seem to work, as well as a huge delay from input to actual action. And I can\'t seem to customize the controller layout, so I\'m just stuck with the Ability to walk and crouch/lay down with said controller. Can\'t aim or shoot.',
       'honestly a great game. but dont get diamonds to buy their packs. not only are they really expensive but the chance of actually getting their special clothes is so small I bought 10 packs of the monkey king and I got the same 2 grey items from all 10 packs.... like wth???',
       'Yea sure there\'s some bugs, but pros totally outweigh the cons. The game runs beautifully on a good device. Most of the problems that people are having deals with their poor devices. Lol. New gears and new map are just awesome. Best game on mobile and very ambitious for portable. Bravo! Keep those updates coming.',
       'Hey NetEase Games, if you ever get the chance to read this I wanna tell you this is a great game and is really addicting. The problem is whenever I play the game it runs at a low fps and lags a lot especially whenever I shoot someone, do you know what is causing this and how to fix it? Reply asap :)',
       'Now its much better than before. But still not enough fps for play shooting game. I feel its really hard shoot 1person.  Becouse fps keep dropping while playing. Zenfone 2 ram 4gb. While playing i had 1 gb more and 8gb internal free space. I hope u can fix this.' ,

      'With each *regular update* this app has gotten worse. Now none of the high quality mobile servers can be played because the app can\'t fit that into itself, thus causing a disconnect. My perfectly ok phone was playing this fine until recently, but now the app can\'t even play what little it could to begin with. Just remove the app from the store already.',
       'For some reason roblox stopped working today im on chrome and usely it works but today i tried play roblox and the mouse will not work it goes in the top left corner if anyone knows whats going on tell me please and fix this roblox!!! I love roblox dont want to lose it!! Hopfully you fix this i have seen its not just me but other aswell whats happening. whatever you did inm that update ruined my gameplay',
       'I would\'ve rated this 5 stars if it didn\'t litterally ban NUMBERS, and also it\'s got A LOT of bugs... Can someone PLEASE do something about these things? It\'s still an amazing app but still, please try and fix this.',
       'OK SO IT ALWAYS PUTTING NUMBERS INTO HASHTAGS!! HASHTAGS?! WHY? YOU DON\'T NEED TO PUT EVERY SINGLE THING INTO HASHTAGS?!... The games and graphics are really nice though. Keep up the good work. My only complaint is the thing that you guys put numbers into hashtags.',
       'Some games are very laggy for mobile players, some take forever to load. Not only that some players cuss and be mean or rude and alot of hackers. The chat system is filtering everyday words such as bed is this would be a positive update for other players to not use simple language. Other than that it\'s a great game',
       'I think it is awesome. You can play with your friends. I have played this game for about a year (different accounts) and I know you don\'t have to have robux to have fun (but it\'s better with robux). If you don\'t know what robux are they are money on roblox that you buy, you can make your avatar look awesome, and you can get gamepasses. I definitely would share this with friends and family. I think if you read this then you should play it. The only bad thing is the chat. It hashtags out a lot of stuff when you type on there.' ,

       'Was good while  out lasted but like every other casino "game" your going to need to spend real money all the time. Might as well go gamble for real at least i might actually win.

      'It\'s OK I love to play the game when I\'m bored and it helps me to be settled back and have a good time. But these all happens when I\'m offline. But when I\'m connected to Wi-Fi there\'s too many ads just slapped into my face. Yes I understand that you\'ll get these ads but ketchapp seriously,will you give and ad while I\'m playing the game??!! It\'s too much for me. But still I love the game so I just play it turning my Wi-Fi off in my mobile.',
       'Nice game but became boring in just one day! 2 options of controls: Spin (Steering Wheel) and Tap. Tap option is easier than spin. You have to complete the damn missions but the coins are only available in Normal mode they aren\'t available in arena mode. For making easy highscore follow this!! 1. Switch your controls to tap mode. 2. Open Arena mode. 3. In the beginning take the U-turn. 4. Keep driving in the middle line i.e in between of lane 1 and lane 2. 5. Just keep driving on that small line dividing both lanes and you\'ll get your highscore until and unless you get tired, I\'ve made it to 3,887.  Normal mode is quite harder than the Arena but it provides coins and you\'ve to play it for getting your missions accomplished!  Thanks',
       'It\'s stupid. It\'s really boring after your first try! And, when you come to a turn, the car doesn\'t turn fast enough. When you turn before a turn, it turns too fast. This thing is hacked.',
       'I know people were asking for different controls, but the new tap contols are turning the game into something so much less original.  Why don\'t you make the steering wheel work like in real cars?',
       'I dont know why people are rating Ketchapp games below 4 stars... I agree games are difficult but one of the unique one\'s in every launch. Their creativity is awesome... Love to play each of their games. Kind of more chanlenging and unique ones',
       'This is an amazing game! But there\'s a tiny problem with the controls: they are hard to be used. In addition, there are so many advertisments and that\'s the only reason I gave 4/5 Stars' ,

      'Absolutely love all of the geometry dash games! Colors and graphics are awesome, game play is challenging but fun, and the music is perfect! Only thing I can complain about is that I wish all of the levels from these free versions were in the full version. I own the full version and would much prefer to be able to play these levels without ads and with all of the cool characters and colors I have unlocked. Other than that though, amazing work you guys, keep it up!',
       'Woah. WOAH. WWOOAAHH!!! Oh. Another Chllenging game but thhe only thing i like in it tha it has Dantdm\'s Old Intro at the press start! Wow. I am pro at Geometry Dash Games and another one oh yea and there is Sub Zero(MK) name there like i saw them quickly. And i would say for the creator: plz. Creator keep the good work! Ok!!! And make more Geometry Dash and can u make something more fun for more people to play with!!!',
       'Oh my god... This is the best geometry dash free game I have ever played,  and is almost more fun than the full version.  Robtop, you have regained full respect after what happened with meltdown. I\'m just speechless, at the amount of work that was put into these three levels, going from the camera angles to the animations. This game is not like meltdown,  which is three short amateur levels, but with three long, harder levels. This game is like a preview to 2.2, and I know it\'s going to be good.  We\'ll done, Robtop! Keep up the great work!',
       'This just blows my mind... one thing I would like to see in the future is some rob-top made tutorials on how each editing items works in the game so other players can feel more comfortable making their own levels and not be intimidated by all the other fan made levels... I am one of those players who is intimidated by the other fan made levels... This could help young and creative minds to create their own levels their friends can enjoy. Thanks 10/10',
       'I love this game so much.  Some of the effects and colours added into the game make it so fun to play and watch. Its challenging and thats what makes it fun. Its not like one of those games that are so easy you finish it in an hour. This game takes time and effort. Also the backround music is pretty cool. Especially nock em with headphones. controls are very easy to use, just tap to jump and usually hold to use the vehicles, so easy! This game is perfect and absolutely fun. I would highly recommend downloading geometry dash subzero.',
       'Don\'t get me wrong, these new levels and songs are fun and addictive and all of the new stuff is awesome... but stop making new apps? Why not just update the original? It\'s kind of frustrating to have a paid version with stuff I\'ve unlocked but have to deal with an unpaid version (aka, ads) and have to unlock skins and colors all over again because new apps keep being made.' ,

      'I think there should be option of chatting with guild members and other players not voice chatting but message ones.  There should be some research option in every guild or either there should be some Commander talent points by which we can increase some of the tactics of team & player.  Main Idea :  I think there should be some event in which 2 guilds can fight with each other & there should be option of ally & others.  I know it\'s kinda different game but it will make fun to game.   Overall this game is best and addictive,  Thanks for making this game.  Great effort by dev team.  Love you.',
       'This game is good fun but pls can u stop peoee from running u over as when 8 get in top 3 some keeps running me over. It\'s still and amazing games but when people run u over its boring and wish u could stop people from doing this   is th8nkthere u should maybe be able to drive places but when u want to fight they have to get out and shoot and have a proper gun fight . Overall this is a great game my favourite mobile game and it\'s really enjoyable. But pls can u make people not being able to do this. Thankyou',
       'great game!  i love the game, its a great game to pass time, with epic moments like a random dancing gun and etc. I have played other games like this on my phond i still prefer FF. BG, the update was also good love the addition of the grenade. 1 thing that would be good to add is a chat box when players are still in lobby. I would have given this 5 star but There are still bugs and glitches',
       'Itu a great game. But there are something you should add like more vehicle, weapon, bom, and inside the supply crate add more item. Second.,when i use medkite it dont do anything, you should make it move when using medkite. And last,  please make the grass and tree taller because it hard to hide inside small grass',
       'I love this game!! Graphics are nice and controls are awesome! but there\'s one thing I want to ask. Can you make it free when we change nickname for the first time? It so will take a long time for me to get 800 diamonds...Pls make it free for the first time...',
       'It is one of the best pubg ...as far as gameplay is concerned. But it\'s matchup(auto) is pretty messed up. It connects me with players who speak different language...hope you will fix this issue...or recommend a solution before I change this rating to 3~4 star' ,

      'You\'re game is ok at best. It kinda really sucks that it takes way too long to upgrade ships or even make any gold playing the game in order to upgrade. And when I do play the aliens are disproportionately stronger than my ships and the power up come way to far and between to make the game overly enjoyable. And I don\'t want to have to spend that much money or invest that much time for a game on my phone. It could be a way more addictive game if you made a few upgrades to power up faster or earn gold quicker.',
       'Just purchased a Galaxy Pack, thinking I would get the 4 additional ships. Surprisingly, it didn\'t and just got robbed $6. Just messaged their FB page and never got a reply.   I recommend to have this gaming company closed down for scamming and robbing people of their money.   TWO THUMBS DOWN FOR THIS GAME',
       'Game randomly places a big red "buy" button right where the big red "play" button is.    I\'ve been given a message saying "could not process payment" several times without intending to buy.  My account is locked down on purpose.  It\'s a real shame because I want to give this 5 stars but can\'t because it\'s trying to contact me out of a lot of money.',
       'Addictive, challenging game. Looks like I\'ve topped out at level 47 in Campaign mode. I play this game many times a day but may lose interest if I can\'t proceed any further.  Also, I would consider purchasing add-ons, power, etc..., if they weren\'t so outrageously overpriced.  Update: it is impossible to clear level 48 with just 2 saves, one save is 2000 coins and the other is a crystal.  If you have more than 1 crystal you should be able to use them',
       'Spend $$$ in the 100s or waste 100s of hours getting what you need to "win" and on top of that half  of your time will be wasted watching ads between ALL beginner levels.  It is addictive, does not always work properly, NO customer support and constantly finds ways for everyone to spend their money on a make believe spaceship that is gone in seconds.',
       'It\'s a great little shooter that\'s easy to pick up. Only thing I\'d like to see is a way to pick which ship you\'re always using at the start instead of the starter green ship and having to rely on getting the ship you want to switch to to drop..., other than that this game earned the 4 star rating.  Edit: Now it seems that an update has zoomed the screen in so much that on the main screen theres icons being cut off and can\'t be seen.' ,

      'This is the most ridiculous game ever. I love it but i do have one suggestion can you make at least one new free map or make other free for a month during their seasons( for example: the buck to school map is free at the staer of july or august).p.s keep up the good work',
       'The gameplay is of course billion perfect and also the graphics!!! If any 1 wanted to play any interesting game....THIS IS THE ANSWER: goat simulator!! But when I was in a house in the game, I found a hilarious thing ..... Doritos the chips, hahaha it was really funny! Also when I went to the supermarket in goat simulator I found lays, Doritos and Oreos..can u imagine??!!!?!?!? Then I hit a girl and a boy with a gas car but they didn\'t die??!!! and that\'s a little bit creepy and weird. If u r asking a question why goat simulator got all of those downloads the 500 million I will answer u, cuz it\'s perfect and no 1 can do a game better than this. The graphics and gameplay and costumes!!',
       'Most rediculous game ever and I love it! But could you at least expand goatville (put more stuff in it and make it bigger) since you can\'t play in the other levels without buying them and a lot of people can\'t?',
       'Guys it\'s a great game but when I start playing the first level the controls don\'t work plz work this out. Otherwise it\'s a really good game with great graphics! Plz fix the problem.',
       'This game is sooo cool but please can you add more maps because having one map is boring however thanks for making it free',
       'I like this game but the other place need to pay!why please make it free and the goatz too please make it free for more downloaders😊😊😊😊 and add more places and powers and can you fix the graphics even better because when you get the gravity suit and you will be big the feets is glitching please fix it' ,

      'I think it\'s a good game but sometimes the ball would go in but then it bounces out you should also add modes, one like there are walls all around and I like the game keep making these addictive games:D also all you guys stop with the adds just turn off your WiFi let them have some money after hard work on many game\'s like would you want to make a game and not get money and just get  ALL YOUR COMMENTS WITH ADDS! ohhh that would be soo annoying.',
       'Ya hate ads? Turn off wifi and play. Stupid phone/gaming noobs. Its a good game and dont hate on it for ads. The ads make the people who made the game MONEY. Give then a break. Let them have money while u watch something u might want. If u wanna turn it off, like i said, turn off wifi.',
       'Would pay for the game to remove ads. I get you can turn off WiFi/data but it shouldn\'t be necessary, and is unfair to the company itself. Please offer a paid ad-free version!',
       'I genuinely liked the game it was fun and addictive but the ads is what kills it. Ad pop up like almost everytime you lose.. other than that its a grest game. The ads make me want to delete it. I hated giving this game a 1 star..',
       'Fun simple game burdened by a slew of constant advertising. Ads while you play, full screen timed ad when you restart (99.9% of time) and an optional 1 time 30s full screen ad to resume. Simply put too many ads!',
       'Fun game but way too many advertisements, which happen to blow through data. I\'ve spent about 1 hour playing the game and have gone through 224mb of cellular data. There is a 30 second ad after every single restart. Even if you goof up and get a score of 10. It\'s horrible. I have to turn off data in order to play the game, and then I can\'t do a 2nd chance. You neeeeeeeed to cool the ads' ,

      'Love it! I play it all the time! You can play online or offline - online gives you a chance to revive. Has course like game play or continuous. No pause which is understandable but kinda sucks. Once you get the hang of the controls it becomes  addicting. Would like to see more land and background options... maybe on the next update??',
       'I paid $2.50 for "Add free" but I still have adds! Refund me or fix the problem - this is unacceptable.  Update: My issue has been fixed and now I am a happy camper. Moved my rating to 4 stars. Would be 5 stars if I didn\'t have this issue for 2-3 days after my purchase. Overall it is a great, simple, and addicting game which is what I think mobile games should be all about. Best game since flight control lol.',
       'Cool game but the ads are irritating. I paid for the ad free but I\'m still getting ads. Contacting the developer and will request refund if they don\'t do anything.  Update: Has become so glitchy that I can\'t even play very well anymore. Still have ads and haven\'t received a refund.',
       'Great game, but the ad free version is a fraud. There are so many ads that the game is unplayable. I am convinced the dev created the ad free version knowing full well that he was leaving ads in it to collect even more money. Like many others, I have attempted to obtain a refund; however, I am resined to the fact that he has willfully stolen my money. Well-played, dev. I hope you get aids.',
       'It sucks. It\'s not supposed to be an ad display app with a game thrown in every once in a while. I opened the game, it showed an ad. Played the first time, it showed an ad and asked me to rate it. Played a third time, it showed an ad and asked me to rate it so I did. 1 star since I can\'t even find out if the game is any good because of the damn ads and whining for ratings.',
       'The game looks fun. I say "looks" because I saw a friend play it and I thought I\'d try it for myself. Every time I tried opening the game, all I got was the Voodoo logo and then whatever screen I\'d been on before I\'d opened the game. I\'d love to get a chance to play the game but this crash problem seems pretty common and a reinstall doesn\'t work. When I can actually play the game, I\'ll rate better. For now, I\'m going off of what I saw from my friend: a fun arcade game with good graphics and gameplay but too many ads.' ,

      'I LOVE THIS GAMEE!! It\'s so addicting and once u get used to it, u can\'t stop playing it! It\'s a great time killer and it auto saves (not of u connected to Facebook.) Again, I love this game and I would recommend this game to EVERYONE because it\'s for all ages (unless u are a very serious person) JK LOL! :D',
       'OK, I love Idle clickers and this is a great game in this genre. Easy to get into, ads not forced on you, nice graphics.  There is one thing that is really bugging me though. You start out with your standard 9 crops and you can then unlock more for each plot. My issue is it does not tell you when you unlock a new one if it earns more than the standard one. Do they just look different but earn the same? Apart from this... Love it. Keep up good work devs',
       'AMAZING! I love this game. It is so addicting and a great way to pass time and boredom. I think though for one small improvement you could add a thing where there are like \'mini games\' and you earn coins for that. Using those coins earend in the mini games you spend it on things like watering cans, fences for live stock and more! This was only some suggestions for a bigger game if you can have or make a new game called like farm life or something like that....LOVE IT...',
       'Like so far But, 2 issues. 1- I don\'t Facebook or do any social media so needs to be a way other than ads for those bonuses. 2- daily rewards Don\'t happen. Shows that they were collected but will not activate unless I have enough diamonds. Please fix. Play offline on tablet and hotspot to get daily reward.',
       'Great and addicting game, but with one major bug. I went to collect my idle money and I watched a video too double it (46 billion total). But when I hit the button to collect it, I never got it. All the money dissapeared and I got nothing. What\'s the point of an idle game, if you don\'t get anything for being idle?',
       'I adored it at the start, very quickly got all 9 plots, but now I don\'t think I understand the point? I thought once I unlocked all 9, I would get a new plot, but instead I have to find (buy) shoeboxes to find new crops...and there doesn\'t seem to be a way of earning shoeboxes. I also completed one of the challenges (change the weather for 3 shoeboxes) but didn\'t get the reward! Very frustrating & O don\'t know what to do with it now other than uninstall it.' ,

      'Love the story lines, the graphics, all of it. Would have liked to seen something that can be done to regenerate the diamonds or do something to earn more diamonds other than finishing a new chapter earns you only one. Did experience my diamonds disappearing and the timer of keys along with the keys reach zero and not returning. Hope this issue will be resolved. Other than these issues really enjoyed the game, it\'s highly addictive.',
       'I\'ve been playing this game for a few days, so here\'s my review. I enjoy the stories even though they use a lot of archetypes, and I don\'t mind waiting for keys. The biggest issue I have is with the gems and premium choices: not only do the premium choices cost an unreasonably high amount of gems, but every time there are choice options with at least one premium choice, the premium choices are always presented as the better ones. This is less like making my own choices and more like reaffirming my assumption that the premium choices are always the better ones. I\'ve come to the conclusion that I would rather pay once to have this app installed rather than install it for free and pay money for gems just so I could pick the premium choices.',
       'I absolutely love this game. i just wish the diamonds and keys werent so expensive. Nobody has $100 to spend on a game. $10 lasted me like 1 day smh...and i have to wait 2 hours everytime i play 2 chapters so please fix that. thats soooo annoying. Id rather PAY for the game once and have unlimited diamonds or please  make the diamonds much much CHEAPER....also itd be cool to make the characters move or place them in the actual scenery in the future.',
       'After reading The Freshman and Most Wanted (which were my favorites, btw), I really couldn\'t sleep! I really loved the stories. Can\'t wait for the second books to come out. Well done, Pixelberry, well done. UPDATE: I really like some of the new books that came out... But I\'m still looking forward to Most Wanted\'s second book more than anything...',
       'Great game but it sucks you have to pay for all the decisions that will help your quest the creators of the game should allow us some good decisions without having to pay for them my story is not going the way I would have liked it cause I cannot afford 5 dollars every decision its outlandash! Give us something, I didn\'t pay the first ten times you asked I won\'t pay now give us a way to earn diamonds stop being so petty',
       'I paid for diamonds which disappeared once I used both keys I had available not happy at all. Diamonds can\'t be earned in any way either. Controls are dead easy story lines are good. Although you only release 1 chapter which takes 20 minutes to complete max per week not enough to keep me hooked and I\'ve stupidly spent over £100 buying diamonds.' ,

      'this game is a thousand times better than agar.io in my opinion! It\'s so much easier to get onto the leader board. Every time I play I get onto the leader board. It\'s just so addicting and I can\'t get enough. Everyone in my family loves it too. Creating your own skin is a great option as well. My only complaint is that the \'play online\' option is very laggy, and if you fix it would be much appreciated. Thanks for a great game, from me, ella, lauren, mollie, shane and ollie 😊😊',
       'I\'ve recently upgraded from cubot to galaxy s7 and unfortunately the game is not working properly like it did on the old cubot phone. The screen gets stopping and it\'s impossible to play. I\'ve tried uninstalling and changing Wi-Fi settings but nothing worked. Other than that the game is sick! Love it,my kids love it and it\'s fun to play.',
       'So I think just about everyone has heard of this game... Buuuuuuut there are some newbies here so I\'ll explain. Its a multiplayer game and It\'s in my opinion that It is probibly #2 best game I\'ve ever played. Great concept and I like to get creative on makeing a snake/worm thing. A+ grade. 👌👍',
       'Playing this game is total fun. But It would be more Awesome if there will be some sounds & a pause button maybe. One more thing, somebody tell me how to BOOST the Slither because everyone is boosting except me😭😌😶🙄😓😑😫🙃',
       'The controlls are pretty bad considering how simple they are.  The lag is unbearable. Fix those and you\'ve got a 5star game all day. Simple fun pick up and put down time killer. In fact the lag is such an issue however, the game is getting uninstalled. You can\'t play a reaction based game when the lag has you 6 seconds behind whats going on.',
       'I\'m highly addicted to this game. It\'s a thousand times better then agar.io in my opinion and it\'s really cool that you get to create your own skin. The only downer is that I just wish there was some music because you start to get a bit bored after a while.This game is NOT a waste of time, and everyone needs to download it to experience the awesomeness!' ,

      'First of all It\'s joyful game few notes need to address it:    1_last 3 weeks is suddenly stopped without farther notification.. And I was about to uninstall it..     2_one of the question was you can play with other users offline. This is not correct!...     3_ need to add "Edit and changing names"     4_Game rated with 5 star.. Than you all 🎱',
       '"Cusion shot on 8 ball" games are great, woukd be cool if one was created at a lower buy-in though.  I think its currently like 8 million needed to play a bank the 8ball game.  I personally like the No Guidline 9ball games,but would love a cheaper bank the 8 game.    Also, well done on adding the upgrade-able cue sticks.  That alone, i think, has made this game much much better.',
       'Likes- 1) The game is pretty addictive.  2) Graphics is good.  3) Variations are cool.  4) Game controls are awesome.  5) You need skills and timing. 6) Stats keeps you update how you       are performing.  7) You make friends while playing.  Dislikes -  1) It\'s also a game of money so....  2) When you win too many games       you get tougher opponents.  3) Despite having good Internet      connection the game disrupts in      between by disconnecting it.  4) The game starts controlling you        in winning or losing.',
       'I realize y\'all gotta get paid but why make the playing experience for those of us that don\'t pay cash money.  Not allowing a player to select a pocket when shooting the 8 ball and allowing your opponent to shoot and win. I guess I\'m pretty good because nobody has been able to get rid of me playing pool. Instead I seem to get strange lock ups or no response from game. I always seem to lose 100s of thousands. It\'s a pretty good app and I\'ve sent many people to download your app.',
       'Best pool graphic wise but the game is not fair what so ever. Game is Controlled you don\'t decide if you win the game does. Your win percentage and rank don\'t mean squat. Cues length and force controlled to games advantage even when reloaded. I had 6,991,000 and my win percentage was 61.3 and lost 1 million 5x in a row. How do I have a 61.3% chance of winning and lose so easily by these 40-50% players like nothing. If you don\'t actually buy stuff with actual money on app game will treat you poorly.',
       '8 ball i have been playing it for sometime now and I spend alot of money on the specials.. great specials.. but I noticed whenever I buy coins I don\'t win any games until those coins are over and I\'m only winning recently 2 games maximum in a row and normally my win streak used to be 7 and above... I don\'t know why this is happening but it sucks because it\'s putting me off the game.. it\'s like 8 ball is making sure I\'m losing hence the rate 3' ,

Ihope you get what I mean.. well anyway.. overall its a really great app and most of my schoolmates if ever bored uses this app its fun, and witty but would have been addicting if there was music or something.. its my honest opinion though but really its an amazing app.. 😚😅',

      'Gameplay design and illustration is perfect I think, cute character and easy to understand this game.  But ads and especially loading, it takes so long when we want to play this game, loading start screen, after ads also loading, after fame also loading, it\'s bit lazy to open this game bcos of long loading.  And last, so sad we cant play this offline or multiplayer maybe (such as visit friends buildings or make a business with any players.',
       'To many problems, but great idea behind the game. Twice now I\'ve had over 2000 fame stars but when I\'ve come back they are gone and I\'ve only got the 500+ stars I previously collect. No point playing when the game keeps loosing your saved games and you loose your fame points.',
       'I am writing a review for this game because of one problem from the settings menu. The settings menu that is on the top left corner of the screen where it gives you the option to turn off both music, sound and notification. I turned off the notification so I wouldn\'t be notified of anything coming from the game. The notification setting isn\'t doing well. I keep seeing a notification popup once in a while. Please fix this problem.',
       'Could have gotten 4-5 stars but the game CONSTANTLY keeps telling me I\'ve "lost connection", implying that I have no Internet, even though I very clearly do. Needs to be fixed as it happens very randomly, sometimes on startup, sometimes even in the middle of the game! Very annoying for someone who is just getting into it..',
       'Game requires internet connection non stop to play, thats absurd in this day and age. One star until you fix that glaring design FLAW!!! Also updating everytime that the game asks to rate.',
       'Not liking it. When u leave and come back it tell u that u can double the coins u made while gone if u watch a video but it doesn\'t add it. I am missing several trillion dollars. It just keeps the balance u had wen u left' ,

      'I think that you should win the balls all so instead of just trophies!! You pay so much money to qualify for a tournament and you got to pay a 10,000 dollar entry fee and then 1000 ever hole!! The game is coming to how much you can spend instead of how good you are you shouldn\'t be able to enter a rookie tournament if you have over a thousand trophies!! Maybe it shouldn\'t cost so much to be able to get into the tournament!!! Besides if you spend a lot of money the people who can\'t spend as much!! I enjoy this game a lot I play it all the time I believe that it should be cheaper to qualify for the tournament!! And when you lose your game that you should loose the ball your playing with!! I really appreciate your time in listening to my opinion!! Hopefully this might make it a little more fair to the people who can\'t spend the money they would like!! Sincerely a Huge fan of the game!!! Thanks Joseph',
       'This is a great game but it has it\'s draw backs. Due to a glitch in the game I had some coins and trophies taken from me in a game that never loaded. The biggest issue with this game is there is no offline solo play. A solo or practice mode would be great to allow people to get a feel for the game and be able to make tweaks in certain scenarios when playing with others. Easily worth 5+ stars if some adjustments can be made. Very addictive, very fun and suspenseful, and a great time killer.',
       'I like the game. But you repeatedly match me with players that are much better. I dont get a fair chance. You do this every time i get trophies & coins, & you keep it up till all trophies & coins are gone. All i am asking for is fair matchup. I also dont know how you can justify a person with just 12 games having 120 trophies, it has happened on several occasions.',
       'Game is based on luck. Could be so much better if it was more realistic ie club selection. How can it be fair when it is easier to chip in from off the green than it is to hole a putt? NEED TO FIX BUG THAT MAKES MY SHOT HAPPEN WITHOUT MY FINGER LEAVING TABLET SCREEN!!! HAS COST ME HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF COINS!!!',
       'Awesome game. The only thing I don\'t care for is, why am I playing people that have 80 trophies but have played 2,000 games? I mean I\'m working with starter clubs and they are playing me with so much better clubs.. I just don\'t think that\'s very fare. And is there any other way possible to receive extra gems and coins or get extra clubs higher-ranking clubs? Thank you for your time and thank you for coming out with this game it is awesome',
       'Game seems fine as long as you DO NOT BUY ANYTHING!!. Game is so rigged and its about the most obvious Ive ever seen. Just before tourney time, you will not make a shot and you will be reduced to ZERO coins, balls and trophies. I have over 10,000 matches so I know the game and support very well. DO NOT BUY BALLS, COINS HEARTS OR ANYTHING ELSE FROM PLAYDEMIC.' ,

      'I like the mobile version better than the PC version because the touch screen works better than the mouse. I also love the food machine you can get for 12 diamonds. It\'s pricey but we\'ll worth the purchase. I kinda wish the pace of customers was a little bit slower so I had more time to prepare the food. I do wish however that I didn\'t need so many gems to upgrade every little thing. Or if I do need gems then maybe they could be easier to get instead of only getting 5 every time you level up. So, decrease the pace of customers and make the gems easier to get',
       'Love this game. Easy to play. My daughter and her partner both downloaded after playing mine.  When I first downloaded the game I didn\'t need to have the internet on. Don\'t know what happened but I know have to be on the internet to start the game but can then turn the internet off. Otherwise happy with it. So many restaurants to buy. And you can get ahead with the casino and keep playing everyday to get more money and gems. Thumbs up from me.',
       'this is a very well made game with excellent graphics and challenging play. It is however very money focused. The beginning levels are structured to encourage upgrades which at first are reasonable. Each later stage requires more diamonds to complete. The so called \'challenges\' are Impossible to complete without upgrading every implement so are essentially impossible for free play. Players beware!',
       'I love the way this game plays, and it plays like a dream. The grafics are wonderful, but there is just one flaw. The diamonds. You have to either play for a long time to earn more diamonds, and you can, or buy them with real money. And the game causes you to spend more diamonds than you can earn. From the atmosphere itself, to the food, and the appliances. Unless you have a lot of time and patience, or have the money to buy diamonds, this game might grind your nerves.',
       'Very nice graphics and addictive. The best thing is that it does not force you to pay for better progress. Ads are not noticeable. It provides a very comfortable playing environment.  It could be even better if the food can be more sensitive to touch. I always fail to grab those cooking food causing them to be burnt. Nice game overall though.',
       'I love cooking fever it\'s so fun and easy! My friend disliked it so I tried the game and l love it! I think you should be able to put tomato sauce on the burgers and onion on the sausages and there should be a movie food bit were you can serve food that you would get at the cinama like popcorn and slurpies because that would be AWESOME!' ,

      'Veeery enjoyable game! I feel like it\'s advertised too much, but it\'s definitely worth playing. Especially if you love games like Bejeweled!  Some of the levels are unnecessarily difficult to get by. You have to either get lucky, or be some type of strategic genius to pass them within a good time frame. That\'s slightly disappounting. Its too much of an encouragement to use money.',
       'I really like this Game so Far. I will play for awhile to See how it Works & If I like it. Absolutely Love Your Game. Play it ALL THE TIME!!! I Must Admit that I Really Do enjoy this Game! Sometimes I find myself Having a Hard Time With Certain Levels. I Could be On that Level for Days or a Few Weeks. I think with Some Improvement that Would make People Play. This Game More. But I Must Say Hat\'s Off to The Developers',
       'The reason why I love the game is bc its very addictive An it helps me concentrate. The only thing that I would like to suggest that we pull our friends in the game an work at these harder levels together so we can move forward to help Austin an his family members out. We still  need to be able to use our coins when we desire to not have to go through 2 boards on a game.',
       'It\'s catchy and addictive. Hooks you early. Enjoy the graphics, storyline and gameplay.  However as you get further into the game you pretty much have to spend money to advance. If you get an award, say an hour of free playing time, its rare to advance during that free time so it\'s a waste of an award.  On a smaller note there are not many decorating options. This is not a deal breaker for me however.',
       'I do not want to do the garden that is why there is a gardenescape game! I want to work on the house but too many task on the garden! What is the point of having a gardenescape version if the homescape is also aboyt the garden?! Spending too much time in one room or part of the house. Taking too long to advance into one level. Unnecessary requirements or decorations for the house. Exciting at first but too long to advance it becomes boring already',
       'I enjoy the game both for the mini games and the home decorating.  My only complaint is that I\'ve spent a lot of time in the yard and I prefer to stay in the house, but there is no choice as to what rooms unlock.  I hope the game goes back to the house soon.  If I wanted to do the yard who would be playing gardenscapes, or whatever the garden version of this game is.' ,

       'Game is getting better with being fair. Free to play people can actually roll decent heroes after a while with persistence. IGG is still unbelievably money hungry for their newest released things - but I guess it\'s better to wait for everything or pay for it upfront. I chose option 1. Thank you IGG for making rolling a little more fair.',
       'I\'ve played for 3 years and this game has just gone way downhill, this is the biggest pay to win game that exists. It\'s enjoyable to see people have the ability to buy what I worked so hard during the last 3 years for a mere $10. I haven\'t enjoyed this game in months, it\'s a chore to still play. Download only if you\'re willing to drop a fortune.',
       'nice game for the others saying that this is a copy of coc it has a lot of difference this game is more easy to play than coc. coc is a hard game more time o upgrade more time on things in this in only 5 m its fast becouse it is free and you already have a hero if you start the game in coc you ned to be th lvl 7 to get it or 8 idk but dont say that coc an cc is the same becouse your wrong of saying that they are the same (^_^)',

      'I hope in the new update you can upgrade the engine and body kits as well. That would bring back the fast and the furious Season 7 track 6 nexts to be check it says three lap but you are basicly doing lap 2 twice and it says wrong way. Third lap starts when u finish three laps and doing 4th lap counts as 3rd lap. Needs to be looked at this is cheating  u guys are doing',
       'Fix the detection when you touch/hit in perfect drift mode. There\'s been hundreds of times where ive definately not hit and yet it ends. So Infuriating, love the game but that one detail could definitely be optimized better. The drift should not end unless you actually hit and it screws up your direction. 4/5',
       'I love this game and so do all my mates. It dose have a few light glitches as most games do. I would love a night track of some kind in the future but other wise great game all together. Also out of all the drifting games this is the best one at of all of them.',
       'Hey! Absolutely awesome game, dev! Ive been playing it daily now.. But id like to report some bug. On season7 career, perfect drift race on turini south, the game reads me in the wrong way when i was crossing the finish line. So the race would never finished altough the time is still decreasing. I need that 1 starr 😢 Xiaomi Redmi 3pro',
       'Please fix the Turini-south perfect drift class A track in season 7. Lap count doesn\'t work properly, thus after second lap it remains the same, making impossible to save 8 seconds on the finish',
       'Great game. Takes getting used to but overall it\'s a great game to play!  It would be great to get more cars available and at the same time additional categories to upgrade like engine, weight reduction, etc.' ,

      'Have had this app for several months and almost always have fun and the support team do their job fabulously. "UPDATE:"  May 2017, It has now been over a year I\'m still spinning, having fun. It is now mid July 2017 and I\'m still having fun and give it 6 stars but it will only let me do 5! "Update:" We\'re now into mid November and I\'m still happy and still spinning! I am now into February 18, still knocking them dead. Fabulous Fun! Come join in.',
       'I would give it a 4.5 but can\'t. It is very addictive I just wish the login bonuses were better. And when you spin the wheel don\'t get too excited. Very rarely do you get more than $2500. But I gotta say it\'s my favorite slot game. You should bring back that Tiki Slot. That was fun. I\'m really in to the Tigers slot machine now.',
       'I love this Game App! My hubby was giving me the hardest time when I first started playing it...and now he is hooked just like me! I had the best time playing the different games that Are usually locked during the Thanksgiving holiday when all games open. Only complaint would be it takes too long to open unlock games ... People would buy more coins if more games to play we\'re available instead of spending coins trying to unlock games.  I personally spent more cash on coins during the all games open.',
       'This continues to improve.The original variety was fun, but each new game just seems to get better.  The graphics were always good, but the new ones are truly impressive, and fun.  The way they are combining multiple features of earlier games offers more play options and payoffs.  Almost impossible to put down. Bad luck suddenly reverses and is FUN!',
       'I like the games but.. I would rather go to a real casino if i wanna spend and win REAL money, so buying coins with REAL money just for innocent playtime is a Big turn off for me. You lose coins fast like the real slots, unfortunately. I just start playing the game for the first time and I\'m already out of coins. I believe they start you off with a low amount because I\'m already out of coins in 30mins of play. The games and the graphics are fun though, which makes it attractive to play. My only complaint is paying for those coins..',
       'Fantastic game! Best one in Google play store! Where else would semi- intelligent dogs pay real $$ with t he chance of winning 0 in real cash back, only for the fun of it! Brilliant! That being said, Ill keep on playing!Only slot game I never get tired of playing! Games are very realistic, and the graphics are great! Be careful though, able to go through a lot of money quickly because the games are so addicting!' ,

      'Another great game from ketchapp. A very unique idea, executed well and with nice graphics. It is simple yet difficult, a good combination. I gave it 4 stars however, as sometimes the game takes a while to respond to my touch, and often doesn\'t respond at all. My phone is quite slow though, so I\'m willing to give the game the benefit of the doubt.',

I have counted and I don\'t think it is possible for me to have counted incorrectly 20+ times repeatedly. Also now whenever I boot up the game it has the beginner tutorial pop-up telling you what to do which is annoying.',

      'Great game, fair balance of ads. Only thing it needs to mix all the songs thru all levels, as the single song while does hold up to repeat play, eventually gets repetitive. Also need better dictionary because I often play real words and it doesn\'t count them which stinks.',
       'I love it. There\'s only two problems. When you\'re on a streak and you accidentally hold a letter and don\'t make a word you lose your streak, even if you don\'t try to make a word. As well as that, the WORST part of the game is the notifications that constantly pop up even if you turn them off. Seriously might be the reason I uninstall the app.',
       'This game is sooo addicting, I can\'t stop playing it. There are several games that are very much like this one but I like this one the most because when it starts off with just 4 little squares it doesn\'t go on and on. The beginning is so boring when it\'s only 4 squares. This one starts out 4 squares but only goes about 8 levels then it gets harder right away. The others go on & on & on!! WORD CROSSY IS #1 !',
       'I enjoy this game as word games go,  particularly when you finally get to the more challenging levels.  However it is very frustrating that the same word may be accepted on one level but not on another.  So when you enter the word that was previously accepted you lose the accrued points build  up.  This is particularly an issue with plurals - it is so inconsistent in accepting such words. Plus how about only using real words?  Swop on level 275 is not a real word. I do like the daily challenge.',
       'Gameplay was nothing like demo video that convinced me to download it. Just another dull how many 3 letter words can you make from o, p and t game. No thanks.',
       'Paid to remove ads but after getting up over level 1000 the words became sooo inane and obscure as to be unrecognizable. Addictive but eventualy immposible unless you pay pay pay for hints. Level 1367 and I give up.' ,

      'Unless you have 16 hrs a day to put into this game to learn the track you will never have a very high score. Sometimes your vehicle doesnt respond the same as other runs also you may land on your tail and survive and the next time you die its up and down with the control if you keep going or die. And sometimes it tries to flip when you try to take off resulting in a quick death',
       'Would and will give 5 star. But would like to see a gem counter. It gets rather tough keeping count.  Also I noticed sometimes that when come across the areas that have the 4-5 flat spiked walls that you have to time just right. When I die and revive they all seem to sync up together making it impossible to go under. I\'ll try and screenshot it next time. All in all great job and awesome game. Maybe a custom map feature for future. Possibly added to the no ads fee. Would be worth it then.',
       'This game is my favorite game ever. The graphics are amazing, the controls are great. I can\'t seem to find anything wrong with this game. Me and my brother love playing it. I also like that it is available on Google Play Store and the Appstore on iPhones. My old phone was an iPhone, and when I got my new phone I was worried that I wouldn\'t be able to play it, but thanks to Ketchapp and Google Play Store, I can still play it!! Also, I would like to suggest that you add a feature that allows you to create your own level, but it\'s not something you have to add, it\'s just something I think would make the game absolutely perfect for me. Then again, you may already have that feature and I haven\'t seen it/gotten to it yet. Anyway, it\'s an amazing game, and I hope Ketchapp keeps making amazing games like this!!! (BTW, Ketchapp games are my absolute FAV.) Thank you!! 🚘😊🚘',
       'This game would be great if it wasn\'t so laggy. Usually I would think it was an issue with phone storage or something, but I am on a new phone (note 8) and have only added a few apps in total. The game was smooth the first day or two but now the speed changes throughout play. The levels become impossible because the clock doesn\'t slow down even though the movement of the bike does.   Great concept and design. Hopefully that can be figured out if it is an issue on their side.',
       'Love it. Only thing is there is a glitch when you watch an ad for 200 thingy things you get a menu that lets you get 200 more. Than again, than again. Its better on our side than yours but it would be a good fox so you have to earn them! I love all your games, wish I had all of them but I have limited storage!',
       'Good game I figured out why I couldn\'t buy the bikes anymore😹 Anyway sometimes it gets a bit laggy but it doesn\'t last for to long. I told my friends about it and they love it it\'s fun to play when you\'re bored. All in all a good game:) Edit: Game:Score between 54 and 58 me: *scores 54* yes! *waiting* Game: doesn\'t count Me: great.' ,

      'I played Game of War for appx 3 years.  The game started out great, everyone was on a somewhat even playing field. The game advanced to quick and left thousands of players behind. Other Players and I felt we could never keep up.  I hope this game advances at much more slower rate.  We all spend money to enjoy the game!    Don\'t be gready like GOW.  Thank you in advance.  Kirk',
       'Overall great game, however to play and be competitive ait is important to spend. In fact just to unlock some features you must spend at least .99 which is fine by me since I love to spend on this game anyways. I have been playing koa from the start and when this game came out I jumped on the bandwagon in the first 50 kingdom servers. So with that said yes it is LOTS of fun, I love my GoG family and definitely addicting LOL see you on the burning war field ;)',
       'It is a fun game and is the most indepth game I\'ve ever played. That all being said, unless you have a ton of money and a lot of time there is no way this game is worth it. I\'ve spend over $100 and play multiple times per day and I still find it hard to level up my estate. Even in an alliance unless they\'re all very high level it isn\'t much help. I\'m sure they\'re are much better games in this genre then Guns of Glory. To me it seems like a game for wealthy people and made by a company to just make money.',
       'What a great game!  Need to have introductory levels for newcomers, though.  You build your kingdom up and larger kingdom\'s just rush in and destroy you.  When you recover, they come right back.  Level into the attack mode, so people will enjoy the game more.  I am uninstalling after 6 weeks of running an Alliance, because it\'s just not worth the trouble.  Great concept, fantastic graphics!',
       'Love this game! Very entertaining, never boring. My only complaint is with some of the collecting events. You have to do certain things to obtain the necessary items to put together, but for some reason with the current one you don\'t get enough of one item, and too much of another. It would be great if you could trade within your alliance for things like this.',
       'Hey good game. Having played this type of game for almost 2 years, I\'m very happy with the rollout of this game. I only wish that the in game translator was better. So many wars start because you can\'t translate Russian, Chinese and most middle eastern dialects. Those wars often result in people quitting the game. All around, a very fun game. Even if you don\'t spend money!!' ,

      'It\'s gone from a brilliant game I have played for hours to utter rubbish. The latest update makes the game unplayable. The monsters are distracting and make the game pointless. The idea of a bonus for clearing all blocks is good but get rid of the monsters. One very unhappy former Bounzy Ball player- I will now be uninstalling.  Such a shame :-(',
       'This was a great game before the monster updates, now it just sucks because it\'s adding extra numbers to the blocks and all the timers and what not. I used to play it for hours and now I can maybe deal with it for 10 minutes before I get sick of it.',
       'Super fun game! However, I don\'t know what you put in the update, but the balls hit corners wayyy more often and get excessively redirected when they do - its annoying af, please revert.',
       'Great, mindless entertainment to pass the ruins. It\'s not a difficult game, and it gets fun to see how high your score can go. However, it can become monotonous if you binge play for weeks at every break.',
       'Writing new review....do you even test the code for the new update before releasing it??? It is ridiculous the amount of bugs that exist ever "update". I have the skin with music notes. If the "free offer" to try the foot one comes up but I ignore it, my music notes still get replaced by feet. The "monster" that drops down.....what is its purpose?? Its gone before the ball can even hit the block its on, the timer on it is way too short.',
       'Massively addicted to this so much so its taken over Ps4 gaming...  Update: would be nice to have Facebook login to compete with friends and also bonus for clearing all the tiles eg extra points or ball.' ,

      'Really a great little game. One of the only issue I\'m having is that switching/removing captains is quite bothersome, a simple remove button on the map screen would be nice. And a way to see how many cargo shipments you need to fulfill a contract; it gets a bit tedious pulling the old calculator out just to be as efficient possible with the cargo management. But other than that; a really nice game and a good source of entertainment',

I have to uninstall and reinstall the app and it works a few times then the problem persists. Please help me because I really love this game. I play on a note 8. EDIT: The game is no longer playable it just opens to a black screen even after uninstalling and reinstalling, which is why I went from 3 stars to 1 star.',

       'It\'s a fun game but like most games of this genre you\'ll find many elements locked behind paywalls and LONG wait times. This, of course, "encourages" the player to buy premium items with real cash or suffer through the grind. Personally, I\'d rather pay 5$ outright for this game than have all these microtransactions and to have wait times not exceed 60 minutes but...that wouldn\'t make the devs of these games enough money, right? Because it\'s never enough...   P.S. I keep getting a reload error code 2005...not sure what\'s the issue?',

      'I love this game so much I think it\'s the best game any kid could have and whoever made this game has a very nice sense of humor because it\'s really funny and fun because when it goes to where you press the little bell  my sister likes it but I don\'t and I wish you would just not put that on your game it is so much harder for me to get back and I have to lose  my scores I would like you to please delete where  you press the screen and little white triangles pop up. I will get the scheme of five star. I should get at least a little of what I want. there so much wrong with your game. I can sue you and actually no I can\'t because I\'m a child. But if I could sue you I  wouldn\'t because listen here I\'m a nice person and I love your game did the message 4.7 do I make myself clear. Thank you. I am so sorry about the long message I ever granted real bad',
       'I love it, a great game to enjoy. If you like the older versions you will love this one just as much as I do! Plus there is an added multiplayer, now you can play against your friends or even random people if you want. Overall 5 out 5 rating from me!',
       'Are you interested in a knockoff of a much superior game? Do you want the illusion of playing the tiles to be broken when you miss a key but the music still plays on key? Do you want a subpar experience? This gane is for you!',
       'This is the best game I ever played in my life it\'s the best because it is relaxing as I would say and the song is so smooth and great hey who of you who didn\'t  download it yet do it now it\'s great and more so if it\'s not easy for you I mean it\'s fine because I just said that because I\'m really good at it so thank you. See y\'all next time again bye.',
       'I think this game is amazing i think if anyone scrown down pass this game they will reguet it it is so so fun and when you are going down pass the black things it almost makes a big bang so so so fun i love it you could sit there for hours and hours and not get bored and if ye like this one you should try the pink one so so fun as well',
       'Loved the game and even bought the ad free version but everyone  says in the comments great songs and i agree but what about  some songs that we actually know besides itsy bitsy spider? Only reason for the 4 stars rating.' ,

      'good improvements, make more tracks and some challenges to do. also remove rocket bunny cars and make just rocket bunny parts, make more parts, last exhaust is curved but flame goes straight, let us tune engine by putting different parts, like intercooler and turbo, let us change tire graphics, also let us put different wheels on front and back. this game got very big potential, try to involve some multiplayer, with ghosts and rankings, or open multiplayer room for more users live. high graphic option need very powerfull phone, my nexus5 doing 10fps, on medium i got stable 30fps. after update i had to buy last track even when i buyed it before, save file keeps my cars but no track data. let us make layouta for parking track. thanks and thumbs up for you :)',
       'Its got great potential, the physics are pretty good and the game stops lagging if you put it on low graphics. The fact there is only one option for steering is upsetting as i would prefer tilt steering to be a bit more precise but all in all its a great start to something big',
       'I know I said that this game is one of the best but I\'m not so sure now. One of the reasons for that is that the buttons need to be customisable while playing the game because I can\'t seem to press the turn button at the right time because my thumb is not where I need it to be ( plus I need it to be bigger) and you guys have retracted the CR mode for purchasing Nissan GTR r35 and Ferrari 458 Italia as well as the Mercedes AMG c63 and the BMW M4 rocket. Bring back the CR mode for purchase of these vehicles. At least for the Nissan GTR r35 please',
       'Well... Ive bought all the cars that you can without gold... All you have to do is get to 50x and you will have around 120,000cr and thats enough to buy all the cars... And put what you want on it... Add more cars and add tuning, also remove the god damm machine gun exhaust not all drift cars do that... Fix it because its annoying and it also over powers the sound of the car...',
       'I love the game but there\'s a few things I don\'t like. The pause button doesn\'t actually pause the game. It\'s just brings up the menu to continue or go back to the menu. In first person view the textures are broken inside the car (blue grids everywhere) and some times the controls for going left and right become unresponsive for a split second. Not enough to do any damage but enough where I felt I should put it in my review. Once those things are fixed I will definitely give it a 5/5',
       'I love the game it\'s decent just the money that\'s hard to get... And there can be alot of improvements  Sounds of the cars Tracks  And I can\'t select my car that I have in my garage please fix this  Thank you 👌' ,

      'In my humble opinion, this game is truly a work of art and talent. This game can be used by people of all skill levels, due to the variations of complexity and difficulty within each pixel art piece. And it\'s just bursting and overflowing with hundreds, maybe even thousands of art pieces. There are hours of fun and relaxation awaiting you, and what a way it is to pass the time. Even better, it is appropriate for ages of all kind, including small children.Overall, I recommend this to anyone willing, for this is truly glorious.',
       'I love this game! There are so many pictures to color! This game will keep me occupied for hours! I just love how creative they are! But one question...Why do more pictures come by and take the place of my new colored ones? Like, why do more pictures come by everyday? It\'s kind of frustrating to color the new ones and then more appear the next day. Please fix, or stop the glitch. Overall, great game.☺',
       'Awesome app, its oddly satisfying and can either be really challenging ir really easy. Its constantly update with new pictures to do, and already contains probably hundreds lol, if dont 75+ and in saving the really detailed ones for last. If there even is such a thing. But, i think a counter for how many blocks of each color are left would be a really awesome alteration. There are many strategies to use when you do a color by number. So a counter for how many blocks of the selected number are left, it would be such a life save.this game has taken enough of my life already as is lmao',
       'Way to many ads, was hard to enjoy. Would have been more bearable If the ads weren\'t 30 seconds each, and played everytime I open/close a drawing. And, to prevent any ads you have to pay. I just want an easy, accessible, relaxing game. And by either making one pay, or making them suffer is not really my idea of "Relaxing". Thank you for your consideration.',
       'Good but £4 is a lot to not quite remove all the add. Some pictures are still locked behind and walls. Easy enough to unlock but for the price id expected all add to be removed. Also really would like the pictures to be sortable by category with more fantasy and space stuff in the complex pictures. Also there appears to be no way to sync pictures across devices. If I\'ve paid £4 I should be able to switch between the phone and tablet at will. Both are android.',
       'This game is really fun and when u play it u won\'t even know how fast the time has gone by. This game has some really challenging photos to colour which I am still working on. The thing that is not really good about this game is that there are lots of adds that pop up every time. Please improve that. Other than that this game is fantastic and I also really love all of the images we need to colour and how there are different modes u can change image after u have completely coloured it. I would definitely recommend this app.' ,

      'The whole game is very amazing. Listening to the soundtracks can make you get motivated on playing the certain level until you pass it. The game can sometimes make you rage a little, and the colors can be little bit to neon and flashy for you. The whole point that I think about this game is that it tries to make it very challenging. The colors are beautiful in my opinion. The ads can me sometimes annoying, but you can turn on the airplane more so that they won\'t annoy you too much. Keep up the great work, RobTobGames!   Cøokie',
       'Its a legit fun game to play but...  For me I get streshed because when I need to do it over again then u  streshed by not doing it...    Its still kind of a good game though..  Also on YT thanks for...   !!!! 2 SUBSCRIBERS!!!!  I know its not alot but I am rlly happy and I\'m thankfully to who subscribed to me on YT :)  My name was galaxy DJ but now..  Its AngelPlayz I haven\'t even uploaded any videos yet 😂😂 but thanks for the support!  I might be making new videos about roleplays bloxburg builds and games to enturtain u guys to not be bored!!   I LIKE TACCCCOOOOSSSSSSSSS.....  🍍🍍🍍 .. This is so long lol...   Sorry how this is so long 😂😂😂😂 Well yeah that\'s all I got to say..!!?  Cya peace GUYS🍍🍍',
       'Well, I admit, I\'m addicted to this. The levels are SO FUN, and also quite challenging. Sometimes,yes, I rage, but it wouldn\'t be fun if it was too easy.The animation is sophisticated, the music is AMAZING (my two favorite songs are Clutterfunk and Can\'t Let Go) and they give you a TON of levels for a free trial. I LOVE THIS GAME!!!! Thank you Robtop!!! 🙌😎😍',
       'It\'s a real cool game, I do recommend playing this game because not is it only fun bit addictive as well. There are loads of levels so you never get Bored but warning ⚠ the levels do get harder as u go further on. But yeah I do recommend playing this game it\'s super fun, super addictive and i would rate it a 4 star.',
       'So rage inducing! But i am a comete noob at your amazing creations. When o first downloaded it 3 yrs ago i hated it a deleyed after failing the first level before getting halfway. Some how though my abillity for rage cam control itself and yea. So in a way you made a rage game that helped my rage. Huh. Anyways great game might buy full version. Only if i can become a good player though',
       'Addictive & Fun I think GD Lite is super awesome and addictive. I think it\'s fun because it\'s challenging and there\'s super fun things in GD except hacking because that\'s no fun. Anyways GD is addictive because everyone gets it they beat a level get super happy and boom there into the game. And I\'m super happy because I beat every single level in GD Lite! I hope there could be even more levels!                                                        Challenging levels in GD I think Clutterfunk is the hardest even though I did beat it :D! But the most toghest is       Clubstep, Theary of Everything 2, and the one and only Deadlocked the three demons in GD! GD is awesome!!!!! :D :D :D &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 I love you GD!!!!!! 😎😂' ,

      'Very fun and time killing. I play with my bf and 2 friends and we all try to beat eachothers high scores. It can be pretty competitive. Im prob gonna try to get more ppl to play with me too lol. There could be more variety in the blocks, and there should be like different modes, just an idea',
       'Its cool and all but needs some extra features.  Maybe a way to store 1 brick for later or some level advancement.  Maybe challenges or a power up system. The game is addictive but its very basic. with no real progression path,  other than beating your own high score, it becomes boring.  Still,  thanks for what it is.',
       'What they show on the preview and what it gives you in game don\'t even match. They make it look like it so easy. You cannot rotate the pieces. The pieces they give are so random, and most games you can barely get past a couple of turns before you can\'t place anymore and you lose.',
       'This is very deceiving. It looks like it\'s Tetris, but it\'s not. The pieces don\'t come down like the pictures show. I hate apps like this who deceive people to believe its a certain game when it\'s not just to get people to download. Will never download a game from this developer again.',
       'This app would score a lot better if there was an option to get rid of the adds. If gladly pay to have them gone but that isn\'t an option for some reason. They\'re so intrusive and far too frequent even for a free game. Uninstalling and won\'t be coming back',
       'This game says it has all different types of shapes but it has the same ones from another puzzle game. I think this game was very boring and that you should not download it' ,

      'Fun, graphics are nice. Free money goes quickly and some of the games bonuses and free spins some have decent ones but infrequent.. They want you to spend real money like most online slots but if you don\'t play for a couple days and just collect the daily free coins you can play for a little while every few days. Unfortunately there isn\'t a lot of opportunity to get free coins. The wins don\'t out weigh the losses but that is usually like it is in real casinos so  at least you don\'t lose real money :) If your patient and don\'t continue to buy the "sale" packages but rather build up the free daily spins.  I just play other slot games  until the free coins build up a little on this one so I can play for awhile. I do like the game though, lots of game choices .',
       'What a waste of time, had free spins twice but i  all the time never once did I get 6 HEARTS. HOW MEAN CAN YOU BE.If you buy coi s good luck all they want you to do is BUY BUY BUY. Once again why did I bother.  THIS IS THE WORST SITE EVER',
       'I was playing a tournament u have going for Valentine\'s day. I get to a game where I have 65 million and I won over the 20 million that was a quest. I lost over 100 million trying to get a free game quest. If I want this kind of feeling I can go to a real casino and drop real money there and get the same result.',
       'I\'m uninstalling due to excessive notifications.  While listening to one song on YouTube, I got 6 notifications each one chiming over my music. No thank you!  Ridiculous',
       'Bought 14 million credits & they were gone within minutes. Out of all the slot machines I have played, this one is the worst by far. Very boring dull game.',
       'Firstly I think if you are going to advertise 20m free coins then deliver on it and my game continues to freeze and/or kick me out if this issue is not resolved soon I will not continue to use it' ,

      'It was good but then this happened. I was playing just like any other day. My phone had died while I was playing, so I charged it and left it untouched for about an hour or two. When I signed in, all off my progress was erased! Please respond and tell me what happened.',
       'The game was great than EA got to it with there sticky fingers and put adds everywhere, it isn\'t the same game I enjoyed ages ago. It\'s just another add infested game now, even if you do pay for it l. The charm is gone',
       'Irritating. At first it gives you an option of playing a video to receive additional help. Which works only for the first time. Next time onwards no way to cancel the video in case you don\'t want to install it. It is so frustrating. Either allows to cancel or tell the users what to do next. Worst way of promoting other apps.',
       'Why ask people to pay to have ads removed and still have so many features that you need to watch ads for? It just seems like a rip off to me very disappointed in this purchase',
       'I had to update it so I did and when I wanted to play after that, it says "watch video to get extra seed slot" WHICH I ALREADY PAID FOR WITH THE COINS I COLLECTED ALL THESE TIMES. Even before the update, it has so many ads but this is much worse. Definitely not happy with the update.',
       'Well this game is one of the first ones I\'ve played and it\'s very good idea inspire you to play this all because it\'s mad and sick I think you\'ll love it maybe not all of you but definitely more than the people who will hate it which is rare for people to hate this app so I think you should install it trust me it\'ll be good.

      'InstaII \'VEARN\' App Enterr (TVCD) to Start Earning So far so good.Fun way to get money. Won\'t make you rich but the extra cash is helpful. It\'s also the best exchange rate on points. VEarn points equals vac instead of like some of the others where it takes Toyo points to reach mac etc...Also, InstaII \'TOYOCASH\' App Enterr (TVCD) very reliable in paying you when you redeem to Bankk. You can choose assorted giftcards as payment or transfer to WaIet for cash. Your choice. I love these guys thanks for addingsome fun to my day.',
       'I just started playing this game and I don\'t think it\'s live matches. The opponents have ai style movements. I\'d like to play against other players in the matches. I\'ve been crushing the ai and want to try real people. But all in all it is very fun. Best badminton game I\'ve played yet. And most realistic too. I\'ve played badminton for about 15 years so it\'s nice to finally find a good badminton game.',
       'decent minimalist animation, so game is smooth since u are against ai/bot. pretty much wont lose, when u have unlock all item and stats. need an update for tournament against real player. and additional moves or trick to create a bit complexity and thrill to the game. if u like something easy and relaxing this is the game.',
       'All of all the badminton game i\'ve played, this is the best. I love the graphic, the gameplay and all. But the rank, -50 when we lose is just too much. And the price of the equipment and ability is just too expensive. Especially because we only got like 12xp and 82$ when we win a game, its doesnt match with the those expensive things. So i hope you\'ll change something about this whole rank decreasing, the xp and the coins that we get if we win a game. Thank you :)',
       'This game gives me life lol...just pure fun overall, please fix the multiplayer mode. It freezes every time we try to connect and play each other..and we cant connect through Bluetooth either',
       'Really addictive game. Can I give some idea?? 1. Player can choose a flag avatar from where come from 2. Just put some story campaign  Thats my idea. Hope can be better and better again. The last words is... really recommended game.  Regards from Probolinggo, indonesia.' ,

      'So I played it on my iPhone e and loved it. Recently o got a new phone and it\'s am android. I connected to my Nintendo account and loaded it up. My world seem to be it good shape everything there like in my IPhone but when I went to tour only world one was available. I\'m not going to spend another ten dollars to unlock what I already beat so please fix it I wanna keep enjoying this gamr',
       'I have had a very long conversation with someone at the hq and I was talking about the worlds. I bought the worlds on my iPad and downloaded Mario run on this device Android. I ask why my worlds that I purchased on my iPad aren\'t here. They don\'t connect that purchase with Nintendo account. When they connect everything else. I told them I am not paying twice so that brings down the rating for me for this game. But great fun and very enjoyable, but get the linking fixed. Seems a bit of a design flaw',
       'Like a big lugger spit in your eye if your a Mario fan. Iv played since the first Mario. For one I very very much hate how u can not control Mario really u just run forward very very annoying. I\'d be OK with this if not for the insane price they ask to move on after the 1st world! Highly disappointed in this. Make it like Mario or get rid of it personally',
       'Super Mario Run is a good game all tho you might get confused on some parts it helps you back out so thats good. The graphics great motion great then only thing i would like is if they could let us place the house or plant whatever and look at it before buying it other than that it\'s a great game to play',
       'It\'s not worth the $10 for the full game. The online versus mode is irritating at best. The controls are conveniently simple, but eventually become overly repetitive. The rewarding/punishment system for Toad Rally is a double-edged sword,  encouraging players to better themselves in order to compete, but also creates an environment where beginning or casual players may become discouraged from trying to compete amongst more adept players.',
       'Mediocre. Sometimes you can\'t perform well because you don\'t know where the multicolored coins are ahead of time. Also, the level design is not up to par for a standard mario game. I\'d suggest you save your money or if you do get it use the google rewards credits to purchase.' ,

      'Only given a 1 star so the devs hurry up and get the game working again or else it would be a 5 star. This is the best game on play store currently and square Enix have done a brilliant job. No complaints... No p2w... and the graphics if you set them to full are just phenomenal!!! Keep it up guys!! But fix the loading issue so we can get back to akademia!!',
       'Great game so far. Not sure if there is a community forum or something somewhere which would be nice. I had a character on some other server and it seemed to be erased when the new server opened? Its fine though, previous character did not have too much progression. Music is not the greatest though, would be good if you could include more classic FF music in the game.   Dailys seem a bit overwhelming. There are so many quests to complete each day to get all the chests.   Other than that im quite enjoying it. If you can\'t load the game after update clear data and dl again',
       'Support is incredibly slow, they will happily take your money and not let you have access to the items you payed for. Will update this review if they ever actually resolve my issue. It has been 5 days since I submitted a support issue with no useful responses made by them. Update: over 48 hours since last response still not any closer to having my issue resolved',
       'I was hooked up playing this game as you can still get stronger without spending. Unfortunately looks like something broke during the update and was stucked in the FF splash screen. Hoping that the devs are on top of this and release an official announcement to players.',
       'Characters repeat the same thing over and over and it gets really irritating. And now the game doesn\'t even start, i love the final fantasy franchise and you have a really great game, and i like that you have to interact with the game to stay alive and it\'s not just automatic bullcrap, please keep updating the game.',
       'Considering how poorly designed this game looks, I wasn\'t expecting it to be over 1GB in size. I have more than enough space to download it, but apparently your installer says otherwise. And whenever I exited out to uninstall something, it jumped back 10% and gave me the exact same error 10% forwards in time.' ,

      'Amazing game... Loved it...😍 The tunes are AWESOME!!!  And Bryan swag zone At first even I thought that But... It is a maze so it\'ll obviously be twisted... (No Hate) It is actually that you should click maybe after the third or fourth turn to get it right... Even I took time to understand that So it\'s okay 😊',
       'I really wish you guys didn\'t update it. It truthfully bugs me that I can\'t listen to the full song on the menu anymore. The songs are absolutely amazing and the game is very addictive. I hope you will update the game again so that we can just sit and listen to these master pieces if we wanted. Thanks for an awesome game!',
       'It\'s an amazing game. Sure I run around my bedroom screening every time I fail next to the end.... but there is something about this game that makes you happy. Is it the music? Maybe. Is it the back ground and the way it moves?possibly. It\'s all of those things plus more   In a nut shell I really really really really really really really really really love this game :p',
       'Good songs. That\'s about it. The hitbox detection and lag spikes are horrific, the checkpoint system is a blatant cash grab, and what annoys the most is that the timing of music+taps (the core mechanic of the game) is completely broken. It is significantly easier to play the game with audio off, so that you don\'t get distracted by the miss timed turns. Doesn\'t even fulfill it\'s most basic selling point. Atrocious.',
       'The new system with hearts to get to continue from checkpoints is atrocious. People paid 5 euros or even more to eliminate these ads, and now what do we get? 4 measly hearts (i. e. 4 chances to continue from checkpoints) for watching 30-60 second commercials? If I would have known it would become like this I obviously wouldn\'t have paid for it. Shameful.',
       'This is by far my favourite mobile game to date. Loads of fun and not covered with ads like every other game out there (while there is a few this one isn\'t as bad). My only complaint is the new continuation thing. That wasn\'t there but now it\'s forced me to watch ads even though I played to remove ads.' ,

Overall great game when they game out with the sequel it addressed the main problem with this one mainly no other maps and you have to pay to get the female character',
       'I think this  game is so interesting  that I play it all day , and somtimes  it tell you that you  should  never ever  steal any thing  from a dangerous  place where nobody  is there, it is really  difficult.  Good luck  and be  safe',

      'The heroes should be for all players from the lower level. They can make their own choice to choose the hero or switch them. If you provide the better or strongest hero for the strong one, it means the stronger is still the better and even the best. The weaker will have no choice,  but accepting the unfair attack from those strong ones. Please think about it again. Be fair for all players. Otherwise, the stronger or the best ones are still the stronger and the best ones. How about the weak ones? Do they have a chance to use their strategy? It\'s the strategy game, not for only the big or strong players. Thanks!!...',
       'Awesome strategic game, love it. But I have one request to Clash of clans creators that pls update clan castle of coc village that there would be an option that how much treasury do you want to Transfer to your storage. I think all coc players would be love this option and it would be great idea because you can transfer required amount of treasury to your storage and the rest of it will remains safe in clan Castel. If you like this idea and will work on it then pls reply me. I would be thankful to all Coc creators if that happens.. 😊',
       'NICE GAME, NICE GRAPHICS,NICE GAMEPLAY.. Been Playing Since 2015 and I See A Lot Of Changes..  I Wish new content would Be Added More Frequently and I HOPE The Village must Have Village Houses! Cause A Village Is Not A Village Wihout Houses SUPERCELL. There should be houses that has different colors and traits, some which raises stats of barbs and valks, or reduces time to produce troops and spells like in Builder Base,there should be houses which raises defense or offense and houses which reduces building production. This May Give Clash Of Clans A New Spark and Would Be More Strategic than usual. Thanks For Reading Devs Godbless.',
       'it\'s a good game and challenging. Strategy is needed on going through battles, Arranging your defenses is very tough to manage lol..... You want to keep away the enemies from your lawn though........ and I love the "Builder hall" when I\'m done on my "Town hall" I manage the second camp.... although the loot in Builder hall is limited it\'s fun and addictive a real time killer........ keep up the good work developers........ have a good day.... ^_¤',
       '1. Make us know how many players are online and who are the players online                    2. Make us know how many hours ago the player is not online                                                          3. Add more plants or obstacle for extra gems  4.Add more clan banners of flags which can help ofcourse many clans or make your own clan banners or flags. ofcourse when making own it needs to be payed with gems                                 That would be all pls let me know if you agree pls reply I would Appreciate if You,SUPERCELL Agree or not. HAVE A GREAT DAY SUPERCELL! ADVANCE HAPPY HALLOWEEN🎃🎃💯🗺🗺🎃🎃 ITS REALLY AN AWSOME GAMEPLAY AND ITS VERRY ADDICTIVE! JUST 💪💪💪CLASH ON GUYS!!!',
       'The game is wonderful. Love the control and everything but I personally think troop shouldn\'t be expended after a battle. It makes the game kinda frustrating. Loosing all your troops, not everyone can build troop up so fast. But aside from that. You guys did a great job😉' ,

      'I really love this game. I love voting and seeing what other have also come up with. I love that it is really world design where you can actually shop for pieces and not cartoon rubbish. However, I have had a number of issues where the game has had to restart and have even lost diamonds and cash after trying to collecting daily rewards when it re starts, watching endless adds and not receiving rewards for them or downloading other useless games I have no interest in and actually playing them to generate rewards and not receiving them either. These are my only issues with the game. Other than these it would be five stars.',
       'I love this game!! "it helps a lot" with my shopping addiction because I feel like I\'m buying real merchandise. I really enjoy the updates and how you guys added more room to be designed!!!! Also the 2d & 3d option to view products is awesome!! and if your  studying for interior design this is the app for you! I love the voting of others designs, you get to view everyone creativity. I really love how you guys never ask for an rating....like some apps by the 1st go you get popups please rate our app you guys never asked for an rating I choose to. Thanks for getting me addicted :))',
       'I thoroughly enjoy playing this game.  It\'s well made and no technical issues. 2 problems I have is 1) you can\'t sort the items by price and 2) and this one is a big one you can only use an item you purchase 5 times.  That\'s it.  I bought more diamonds so I could purchase more inventory so if you\'re taking my real cash you should let me keep the item in my inventory.  That really turned me off so I definitely will not be purchasing any more diamonds until that changes.',
       'It absolutely amazes me. You can\'t play this game without spending money, but the whole thing is an ad for furniture companies. They get to showcase there new items (with of course brand name and "price" attached) everytime you play. They are double dipping on there profits and it\'s unfair to thier players',
       'Love this game.  It doesn\'t pressure you to rate but after playing about 6 months I still enjoy designing.  A couple tech issues with diamond offers but I\'m still playing everyday and love every second of it.  I wish their were more rooms but i think it is a good amount (about 6/day) to keep you engaged throughout the day and discover new ideas.  Thanks, truely a 5 star game.',
       'I love this game, though I agree with previous reviews regarding rooms that don\'t include the aspects requested for the design challenge. The voting also seems flawed when rooms that are similar to top voted rooms get really low votes and winning rooms include those previously mentioned that have little of the challenge in their design or are really similar. There\'s little information about how the voting works in terms of who\'s designs are up against another players. The daily rewards could maybe reflect more reasonable amounts considering how much everything costs.' ,

      'This game is great. It helps out with working in my focus and concentration issues I have do to TBI. I have to ask though, whats the point of collecting coins if I can only use them to pay fot hints. Also, maybe add a feature where you can use coins to change the background like on some card games. Or maybe just add a free feature to be avle to change backgrounds to a users own pictures in the gallery. Maybe add a few bonus rounds here and there where you have to find words in a time limit. That would be an exciting way to use your brain more. Just some thoughts. This game has some great potential!!! Keep up the good work!!!',
       'This is a wonderful way to end my day. I am addicted. When I taught school, I would give my students a word. They were to find all the words they could out of the letters in the word. They loved to compete with others (kept them from exchanging words). Now I know why I had them do that. I love it, too!',
       'I like the game because it help keep your mind sharp. Also it good for memory. The words are repeated and I like that.  It helps with concentration and focus. It can be used as a teachable tool also. So many little words I didn\'t know was word\'s.  So it also educate you',
       'I really like this game. It\'s challenging, but not too, too much to where you lose interest. Though, sometimes I do have to use hints. I love that it\'s not timed. It\'s relaxing, and I love the music for some reason! Every once in a while it becomes difficult to form words, because the letters want to stick together/controls don\'t work right. That is frustrating, and I usually quit and come back after a while. Overall, a really cool game.',
       'Game is really good, every level brings us more excitement. One thing I would suggest please show us the extra words created so that we can find meaning of those. Rest I can say👍😊',
       'Twice now I have got to level 1234, & the game has frozen. As advised below, I uninstalled and reinstalled. First time, it took me back to level 600. Thus time it took me to level 1. NOT IMPRESSED.   Thanks for info that reinstalling won\'t lose the games that I have already played.   All working now. Quick response.   I got to about level 350 (think now that it was above 400 as I saw a later review about DIGNES at level 399, and had the same issue) and now it has stuck with a screen that says collect and invite or collect. It\'s been that way for 3 days. Tried rebooting phone, no effect. There isn\'t an update so can\'t try that. Had enjoyed game up to that point.  I have emailed help, as I can\'t do anything with the app, short of reinstalling and losing all progress' ,

Even if you don\'t mind to wait 200 days, you will not able to afford it (lvl 10 military Def, Atk, Health cost 100m gold each). DO NOT GO FOR HIGH MILITARY AND T4 WITHOUT FULLY UNDERSTANDING THE GAME.',
       'This game is fun but be prepared for the mother of all Pay2win games.  These folks at IGG are experts at crafting new and exciting ways at fleecing their customers of every cent they can.  You CANNOT compete if u dont pay and pay often.  Players here ...just regular people... dump hundreds of rl $$$ regularly.  You have been warned.',
       'If you like spending mad money to be an Internet tough guy this is the game for you.  Of you have tons of time to kill to be a punching bag for pay to play Internet tough guys it may also be the game for you.  If the computer random stuff kills off your troops don\'t expect to get tech support, it will always be reviewed in 1-3 days, even the next time you ask, another 1-3 days.',
       'Game Sucks! Super high levels can come in wipe you out, seems like if they had a level limit, let\'s say 5 levels above you they can\'t attack, but O NO!!  Every day I come in to find I have been attack by a level 25 and I\'m only a level 14. It takes days to rebuild, so yeah everyday same thing, about to uninstall this game not worth it to me...',
       'Misleading sale information! ! Current Fortune Ticket sale is misleading and horribly overpriced.  "Give your guildmates 10 Fortune Tickets!" for $19.99 should give ALL guildmates 10 tickets EACH. Instead it gives 10 tickets TOTAL for the guild to fight over!! Since MOST of the guild is left out, how can I give them a Fortune ticket as stated?? There is a comparable  $4.99 offer that gives 50 Fortune chest, 2000 gems, and resources. Each Fortune ticket is equivalent to a Fortune chest.... DO THE MATH! ! I submitted the error to online help and was DENIED!',
       'Coloseum is BS. I think one reason is because you cant control who you can attack. I mean come on, auto battle sux really. You can be defeated by a low level and low rank with same type of heroes seriously? I would rate this zero if i could but bad luck for me i couldnt. Its getting worst everday. Ever since i rated this game, i never won a single battle in colo. Really? I wish i can rate this zero. This game is BS. No improvement ever since. I think i have edited this 3 or 4x already and nothing has changed. I gave up colo is BS.' ,

      'I\'ll keep this short, this game was way better when players were able to buy things like the hearts (lives), small and large boosts 750m and 1500m, and other items like this. I have since started to play this again after getting a new phone and this game has changed a lot. Although I like the new power-ups, it wouldn\'t hurt to bring back the old ones as well, and by that I mean allow players to buy more lives, boosts etc.   I hope the developers can make this happen, although I\'m only one person so they will not listen and probably couldn\'t care less what I think, but listening to the customer (or player of your game in this case) would probably work out quite well.',
       'I love this game. It\'s pretty old, but amazingly, still one of the best games on a mobile device. It\'s unbelievably addicting, which is quite a problem.. 😂 But I love this game so much, and I play it everyday. Keep it up, Halfbrick Studios! I\'ve been playing this game since I was about 5, so sorry for the late rate. 😄',
       'I love this game. It could be improved though, I think that during missions where you have to do a certain amount of something in one game (for example, ride 500m on the hog in one run, or collect 4 tokens in one game) there should something that tells you how much of that thing you have done during gameplay. This would be super helpful so you don\'t have to count yourself. Also to those who are complaining about ads, I simply turn off my WiFi when I am playing (this prevents ads) and I turn it back on to do the S.A.M challenge.',
       'Pretty good game. It\'s a really fun game to play, and a great killer time. But it has way too many ads. It also tells you to spend a lot of real life money, to the point that is ridiculous. Like, having to pay to be able to use a third slot. Really???',
       'This game has gone downhill since the last update! I\'m getting more and more "error occured" screens whenever I use the coin multiplier, the 3 chances to get 750 coins, and the 3 free spins. Plus, the game suffers from lag during gameplay. Not satisfied overall',
       'I remember when the game was new, you did not have to pay for as many things. Greedy developers, that\'s right milk it for all it\'s worth.' ,

      'I truly enjoy this game. There is a learning curve at the beginning if you\'re going to have a successful mission. However, soon enough you\'ll be traveling the Stars. This game is challenging enough to keep you interested. You are solely in control of all of your missions, which I like because I don\'t feel like I\'m forced to jump through hoops to get to the next level. Very well designed. Now for the real reason why I\'m sending this review... Designers, please move the engine ignition button away from the acceleration bar. Too many accidental engine ignitions while trying to adjust engine power.',
       'Awesome work with this new updates.  I have an idea. Maybe you\'ve already thought of it.  Multiple engines under the same fuel tank.  For instance, I\'m trying to reenact the Falcon Heavy, but because you can only put one engine under each fuel tank, I had to put several boosters to reach the required thrust/weight ratio.  If we could put multiple engines under a single fuel tank, I wouldn\'t need more boosters.  Maybe, something for the future.',
       'I replayed the game, and also thanks for replying on my other review, but I noticed a lack of, understanding. As I said, it\'s very realistic and challenging, and also that I would really like to be able to send pieces of a space station into space and connect them there, which I\'m happy with now that it\'s possible now. One thing I would really, really, really love and that would help many many people is a hands on tutorial. Like a demo mission(or multiple missions) that teaches how to play the game properly. It may be difficult, but it would just be awesome because me and many other people are hands on learners rather than visual learners. Keep up the good work!',
       'Seriously one of the best games I\'ve ever played. It\'s just so addictive.  However, I am currently working on trying to land a rocket on a platform in the earth\'s orbit and I find it almost impossible. Can you make something that let us target another rocket and calculates the transfer window for us (much like the target system for a planet that you currently have).  Would be nice if that can happen. Anyway, here\'s a five star for the great work!',
       'O.M.G. This is the most beautiful, awe inspiring app I have ever used. I feel like I am living out the history of space exploration! I did two sub-orbital shots, then orbital. I did the three orbits of Col Glenn... ran out of fuel! Aerobraked home after a total of 8 orbits. The coolest game ever! (One thing, I think there\'s a scale factor error somewhere. Orbit periods are about ten times to quick, given your stated velocity. Also mission report says you went to 15km when you went to 150km.)',
       'The creators could really make some improvements. For example i\'ve made a space station that can latch onto other ships, however I can\'t get any other ships close enough to latch on. We should be able to set other ships as targets so we can latch on or whatever. Also perhaps add wheels so people can build rovers that can land and travel on different planets. The gameplay is not too hard but not easy all you need to do is look at the tutorials and you are set and the graphics are good.' ,

      'It\'s a really fun game, but sometimes you\'ll play a video to revive your shark and the video will play but you don\'t get another life afterwards. It\'s hard to believe that it is a WiFi problem because if it was an ad wouldn\'t be able to load at all. Also, I have paused the game before and come back minutes later and the game had kicked me out and not saved any coins/gems gained from that round. They clearly have a few bugs to work out.',
       'OMG! I love the gameplay in this arcade game I love everything about it. It is very cool that you can evolve sharks that can eat more stuff. Keep the updates coming it would be better if you added more sharks in this game . I recommend downloading this game if you want something to do in a long amount of time. This is so addictive I can\'t stop playing it!',
       'My apologies for the negative review lately. But to be honest, I have to use VPN just to log-in in Google Play and enable cloud sync or else, I wouldn\'t be able to sync my progress. Just a little request, can you make the gameplay smoother for lower end devices, such as devices with 1GB RAM? It lags frequently during gameplay. Thanks a lot!',
       'Really fun , good graphics, funny screaming when we eat the humans. The big sharks health will drain too fast after 10 - 20 mins. Overall really good game when ur offline',
       'Amazing game. I completed this game in 48 minutes Hahaha! Because I used luckypatcher :) I downloaded the luckypatcher in Googlechrome But it can harm your Device..... And the last shark is Moby dick His baby is as big as Megalodon.',

      'Such a Blast to Play. App never seems to grow boring like some other games. Also the apps not constantly hounding you to spend on Upgrades and Advances which is nice. Your character jumps higher, flips and twirls faster as U advance further. I play it once or twice a day at least. All in All a great/fun app....ENJOY !!',
       'Ads ads and more ads. And really pushy ads that you can\'t just close straight away too. You spend more time watching ads than playing the game, and honestly you can\'t advance in the game without watching ads for coins anyway, so it\'s basically an advertisement with a mini game in between. Scummy sell out app.',
       'Since the last update, being able to double up on coins from hourly balloons is impossible.  Also watching videos for coins isn\'t working.  This game is great when everything works right.  However, it is getting frustrating not being able to view videos for coins.  I\'m game ad breaks are still working, so what\'s the deal?  The # 1 thing that keeps me in a game is not having to spend real money.  I a star simply because of this.  Fix it please.',
       'In this game once you have all of the flips it gets really boring. Also there are way to many ad breaks. This game was really fun but now that it\'s newer it\'s boring. It lags to much and kicks me out. I give this 1 star',
       'This game is great but I would only rate it a five if there were less adds. Every game I play, as soon as I finished it said "add break". This is very annoying as the adds are up to 30 seconds long. Please get rid of them.',
       'The game desparately needs to offer more coins as skill level increases.  The frequency of coins remains the same while the skill level demands more and more coins (in the thousands).  Watching ads helps, but the player finds themselves doing that exclusively, which defeats the purpose of the game.  Physics, graphics and gameplay are good.' ,

      'Great game, fun to play.  Only things I don\'t like are the fact there are so many ads and not just short ads long videos which is really annoying, and second and probable the biggest issue I found is that there is no single player option! I have to have like 10+ games going to enjoy playing if my partners arent online or play often. Would be much better if there was single player option',
       'Ads are too long and frequent but other than that, it\'s good.  It could do with more English stuff though. I have no idea what gym chains are in the U.S or discount stores or supermarkets for that matter but I do know England. Some rounds I can\'t take part in and end up losing the game because if it. Also, a lot of English synonyms aren\'t recognised either. I\'d enjoy the game even more if I could relate to all of it.',
       'Kind Of Likke Family Fued! U Can Play Aqainst Facebook Friends Or Randon Players & Go On A Streakk! Messaqeinq & Help Buttons, Earn Extra Tiime & Fill iN Answers For 30 COINS 🤗 Poll If The Questiion iS Fun Or Nott & Suqqest New Answers! Adds Afzer Rounds Butt Most U Can Skip After A Few Sec. Lovee It!',
       'This is an awesome game. A few suggestions though: Think it will be more fun if players play at the same time. Also why is fight list 2 not on the Play Store? I also think you should consider more international answers for questions that have a broader scope like  the one about Coca-Cola brands. All the ones available in my country were not recognized as answers. Great game !!!',
       'Update:  now the game won\'t let me start a new game.   Original post: Buggy to say the least. Paid to remove ads since it was only .99. And now the game randomly quits, and erases any games I\'ve started when I exit from the game for any period of time. Was find until I removed the ads. Great way to treat the people paying your bills.',
       'This game is very addicting and so fun to play. Some are challenging and can be hard if you don\'t spell the word correctly. I only wish we got 60 seconds. Some of the categories consist of longer words and some people can\'t type that fast. But I do love this game, just not an ad after every round.' ,

      'Okay heres the thing,every f game is with money and this game was so much better without those money,i was 1000 lvl and my tom is gone why? Cuz u didnt made that feature back in the days,also u made this stupid diamonds alll for money,and not coins like it was...its not all about money get it? This game was so popularbback in the days and now is trash with all those videos to watch all those money you need to spend on clothes for tom...its ridiculus...sry for my english im just disapointed cuz u turned this game in real money not coins where you can be able to buy everything by playing like i did....',
       'Not good for little ones. Too many buttons leading ads or in app purchases. Might be good for kids 6+ who would know a little better but my 3 year old just clicks everything shiny which of course is ads or in app purchases',
       'Imagine someone\'s cat in real life is starving to death because you won\'t feed him/her, while your  taking care of a cat on your phone. Weird.',
       'I like this game very much. I have played this game from 2,3 years but I don\'t the recent update of this game in which the premium galactic and royal fittings beddings, clothings are brought by diamonds which I don\'t like. Before this update these things are brought by coins and now these are brought by diamonds which I hate it and give it 4 stars.',
       'This game used to be fun not no more, it restarts my whole phone and then I go to play it, and it freezes my phone up, or it shuts off and it goes back to the home screen, fix it and might redown load it. If not then I\'ll never play this game again.',

       'Superb game. Graphics and gameplay both are quite good. But i feel problem in few controls like, trying to watch videos for coins or freeing up slots in chest. Those are not working. Some adventures can be added, like storms, attack by other players, able to see islands and can steer the raft towards it, going to an unknown island, etc. Sometimes, it becomes a bit boring after certain level. Adding new adventures may help players to remain in the game. Thanks.' ,

      'What a good little game. Nothing special in the graphics department but it delivers on everything it says and shows. After playing for a little while I couldn\'t help but feel like I was waiting for a little bald guy to want to eat me if I got an answer wrong, "cans we eats it precious". Jokes and riddles. Very good game. Well done.',
       'Game is really good specially for kids . Makes them think. Only bad part of this game is the list in answers.. they are already displayed. This makes the game very easy. It would make an awesome game if user had to enter the answers.. hope the developers fix this!',
       'Great gane, it\'s got good riddles, but level 3 is a little messed up. It has repeated riddles, riddles with multiple answers (what time is it) and some that are two easy. If you could go over that level and maybe go through a couple others/the rest, that would be nice. Great game overall though!',
       'The concept is cool and the riddles are fun but I dislike that it gives you four options to choose from and most of the time, it makes it very obvious what the right answer is. I would love this if it let you type in your answer or give you a section similar to hangman and you can fill in the letters for your guess. That way it actually makes you think and figure out the riddles instead of picking the word you think or know fits best. I also can\'t stand how many ads pop up during a game so simple like this. If they limited the ads and changed the layout and used a different font style I think it would highly imporove the game. But that\'s just my opinion so don\'t let this review stop you from trying it for yourself. I just think a little more time and effort could\'ve gone a long way for this app.',
       'I found "500 Riddles" to be somewhat misleading.  After the first few levels the riddles started to repeat. (Either the exact same riddle or the same riddle worded differently) Also grammar and punctuation errors in the riddles started to get annoying. But overall I did enjoy the program.',
       'It\'s fun.... But way too many adds. Still love playing it....but it\'s just annoying... Ok so to add to this: im on level 19 now and a LOT of the riddles are repetitive...again, still a good game and good time waster but I\'d prefer new and harder riddles as the levels go up ... Just some advice to the maker of this game!' ,

      'This game is the definition of a really bad freemium game. You get to play one game an hour. If you want more you have to pay a ridiculous amount. Full of bugs and the game freezes constantly and if it crashes mid game you wont be reimbursed your wager or energy. The old family feud was great. This is just garbage. Uninstalled and moving on.',
       'This game would be alright if you removed the chat. I came here to play the game, not talk to randoms who want to know where I live and if I\'m single. I don\'t enjoy being harassed. If I wanted to meet people I\'d download a dating app FFS.',
       'Not a bad game but it\'s a bit silly with how specific they expect answers to be. Example- reasons kids throw tantrums, I answered lollies and toys both incorrect then once the reveal came it was wants a toy and wants lollies were the answers....like c\'mon now are you fkn serious. Think this is sadly be another game to be deleted. Also HATE the FB log in, no good for people without FB',
       'Geared only for Americans, takes an hour to get another ticket, answers like "go for a run "are incorrect only to find the actual answer is "running" are a few reasons why I have not enjoyed the game. Room for lots of improvement. If they fixed these plus the glitches I\'ve just read in the comments section, then it would be a great game indeed!',
       'Fun game,  but the answers are American so it doesn\'t make sense if you don\'t come from there.  For instance,  they reference american food snacks and sports which I\'ve never been familiar with.',
       'IM IN LOVE WITH THIS GAME! I definitley reccomend family fued to be played. The only low is that you have to wait an amount of time to get more tickets. But thats where you patient. Hope you guys download it and have fun!!!' ,

A few bugs and connection issues which can be frustrating at times especially when your team depends on you for points. Though I believe they\'ll eventually fix these issues as this is the BEST racing game out there and it\'s only getting BETTER!',
       'Best onlin3 mobile racing EVER!! IM A VETERAN GAMER AND THIS GAME IS HANDS DOWN TOP OF THE MOBILE RACING GAME. Great detail and graphics. Precision tuning. REALISTIC CARS IN ALL ASPECTS. PLUS an added Bonus is it features FAST AND FURIOUS AND CARS FROM THE SERIES. I need access to more cars. Its so hard to get more silver or gold to get newer cars updated.',
       'Customer support has won me over. They have literally provided the best resolution can think of for the game removing all my fusion parts. Hopefully I don\'t have many issues in the future but this one time moment has definitely filled me with confidence that in future, zynga will fairly sort things out.',
       'Excellent graphics and easy to upgrade but the live races leave something to be desired,  you start off the same way you do on single player mode against the story line but in live race it makes me sit at starting line for almost 2 full seconds before I can take off. I have unlimited data and full bars with my service, defiantly not worth the effort on live races.',
       'Great single player. Fun gameplay thats simple but entertaining. Decent customization and great upgrades. A little pushy on spending money but it\'s ignorable. My issue is with multiplayer. I can never connect with anyone which I don\'t have any interest in. But two out of three of my goals are for beating other players. One wants to me to beat thirty people. That\'s ridiculous.',
       'If you have a problem with this game, do not expect help from support. They quite simply do not care. They give copy and paste responses to all requests for assistance. Special 1 off vehicles are far too expensive and give little return.  The longer l play it, the less l like it.  Connection issues have continued for 6 months with no solution in sight. SUPPORT NOW REFUSES TO ANSWER MY QUESTIONS. THIS GAME IS A RORT!' ,

      'Is game could be so much more than it is! After a few weeks, PVP becomes a joke when you are up against paying users who have one shot kill guns and a barrage of armour.  Then single player is just rinse and repeat over and over again.',
       'Good graphics but the character movements are clunky.  I\'m a hardcore FPS gamer and I like to test the limitations of a game.  So tried shooting a shoulder and the bullet went for a headshot instead whereas I clearly know my aim would miss. Glitchy.  Clunky and not so realistic unfortunately.  So not sure why the high ratings.',

       'Could be a fun game if it wasn\'t for the constant pushing of buying premium packages ridiculous cost involved in doing anything. When will these companies realise. I will pay a few pounds for a good game but I dont want overpriced micro transactions and constant adds',
       'R U B B I S H.  Allowed 3 shots then I was being forced to spend some real cash. I felt I was being tricked so I uninstalled it and found a game I could play & evaluate prior to any cash spend.

      'Great timewaster! There are a lot of characters to earn and you don\'t need to spend real money to get them, so that\'s a plus. However, rated it a 3 cuz there are sooooo many ads. I get that ads generate the revenue to keep a good game free but an ad populates for literally every action. Win a game=ad, lose a game=ad, go to the settings=ad, change the volume=ad... ok the last one is fictitious but it really seems like that\'s how it works',
       'Love the game, its fun, addictive, and challenging. It makes you actually think before you do anything. The ads really are a bit much, being that after every single round in a tournament there is one. Also, one major thing, keep up with the updates. IOS users seems to have gotten an update with new characters and pvp mode even but not android',
       'The game is simple to immediately start playing and fun. I shouldn\'t rate a game based off of this but, these pop up adds are tremendously common. Adds are essential so that the app can support itself but to have an add after every single play and then have an add to open a chest? Really? That\'s a bit much, especially, when the adds are not easily skippable and even force you to the download screen of the add. The game is simple, fun, and has witty, silly, and quirky characters. But the adds are a bit much.',
       'Me and my son have had fun with this game and made an attempt to collect all characters. The game is set up so you can not earn all of the characters but have to buy the last couple in a cash grab. It would be fine if they we\'re only available for real money but the game gives the illusion that you can win them in a chest. One that we have spun over 50 times without success',
       'The game itself is enjoyable and the controls are quite simple. Very intuitive. But Jesus Christ on a frosty log, the ads are way to much. After every round, ad, want your prize? Ad. Wanna do anything in the game? Enjoy the ad. Jesus guys, I don\'t mind ads and I understand that\'s how you make money, but you shouldn\'t have to watch an ad to get your prize for winning... Come on.',
       'Everything else is great, EXCEPT the amount of ads... I love the game, but I don\'t want to keep turning on and off airplane mode so I can actually enjoy it.  Edit: there are ads after I go into settings and more information, which doesn\'t leave the app!? Seriously? And the "messages" are all more ads for other apps too, lol. Bro calm down with the ads. This is why I\'m now uninstalling.' ,

       'Although the game is really  good in every aspect, but when it comes to limited time events  i have to play day and night to win a car. It really gives you a bad effect on mind which ruins the fun of playing the game. They should be made a little easy which keeps the fun of playing. After the new update there is a problem. Whenever i see an advertisement to reduce waiting time for tickets, the time won\'t reduce and this happens like 10 to 20 times in a day.',
       'When I started playing this game I really enjoyed it. But now I realise that in order to progress, you MUST spend REAL money. I am a family man, with a wife and 6 children, I just wanted a game that I could play when kids are in bed and wife is in bath, I don\'t have cash to spend on games, the worst thing is the 7 Day events, you cannot beat them without spending money. Very disappointed. Good game but don\'t expect to progress very far if you don\'t want to spend money.',
       'The game is undoubtedly based on a pay-to-play foundation. Car Series is virtually impossible without spending money. Even with pulling all nighters, spending over 1000 gold, and not wasting a single ticket, I couldn\'t make the PR requirement for the final race of blackridge rumble. 7 days of suffering to get 40 blueprints.',
       'Its a good game but its too much of a "money making game" than a fun one. I feel like ive to race 5 races and put a few euro in.. now after new update u can get less free fuel, gold, i dont see free cash from watching ads.. im slowly dislikeing it and might delete it soon!',
       'I give the game 0 stars and EA 0 stars.  Very very slow to load.  Cheats all the time in black ridge rivals, more so now you have more cars to get passed pointless trying to win even against cars you should be able to win against.  And the points for winning or losing make no sense.  Can not see any point in playing this so called game any more.  Update 31st Jan 2018, black ridge is bad as it is but now I lose points and go from Icon 2 to Icon 1 after change from season 12 to season 13.' ,

      'This game can fit almost ANY personality type, keeping you entertained for hours!  Don\'t worry about getting low scores, because the game starts out slow and gets faster, so you\'ll always be prepared for faster tiles.  There are challenges where you challenge other people in the world!  I never want to give up on this game, its really addicting!',
       'This game has no WORLD\'S favourite song  DESPACITO  SO i m hating it tooooo much  when i see this then i think that let\'s download it bcoz it contains despacito song also but when i see all album of this app then i started hated it. So i would request from CHEETAH GAMES that plezz add DESPACITO SONG also in it This is my humble request from CHEETAH GAMES.',
       'This game is honestly a great time-killer and even has it\'s challenging parts, but from what I\'ve noticed as you get to the higher tier songs they just get slower and slower and are just flat with barely any challenge. I expected more of a challenge with a higher level but now this game is getting horribly boring.',
       'It\'s been 4 months since my report that the game has such a major glitch, still NO improvement. I lost so many lives just because the song suddenly slowed down and then as suddenly fast forwarding itself, there\'s no rhythm at all. Why don\'t you just fix the glitch first rather than add more songs.. Now, at 2018, it\'s only getting worse..',
       'Great game. Played to level 120 and have over 500 gems but then I switched devices. This requires a Facebook account which I did not have. It worked for a little bit until Facebook disabled my account for doing nothing. They need to fix the method they use to sync progress. Now I am level 3 with 17 gems.',
       'You should add a way to transfer progress. Not copy but transfer so i (and probably many others) transfer to a new account. That would be helpful. And I don\'t know what that freaking "slow down redirection" thing is but it screwed me up!!' ,

      'Thx for updating Frozen Shadows. Blazing Sands still needs work. Too much water, not enough Sand. Needs a "slide," I recommend sand surfing. The canyons also get boring. The variations between it and the other levels don\'t compare, especially for the gem cost to play it. Still, fun and relaxing, and stays fun. 4/5.',
       'I have been.playing this game and won valentine and Chinese new year run but main problem is same glitches as in old temple run the score 24,000 suddenly becomes 4000 and then to open new map destinations you need 500 diamonds so it\'s quite glitchy and unrealistic',
       'This is worse than worst whenever I want to play this game it says that I have to download the content and it starts downloading this really takes too much time I really hate this app and I suggest you to not download it because downloading it is really a waste of time and your Ram because it is of too much storage which can harm your Ram and maybe hang your mobile',

      'This is by far the best chess "trainer" for me.  It\'s got a nice flow and the game isn\'t "stupid" like most other chess apps/games I\'ve played.  I plat at least a few games every night and I feel like it give me a nice challenge and makes me really think about the moves I\'m making.  Especially at the higher difficulty levels.  Overall a great chess app with no glitches and a good brain inside of it.  A must for a chess player with any real skill at the game.',
       'I love this game and the best brain exerciser game ever in the history.  The cool 3d view makes the game as if I am playing on the real board, very good graphics. However, it doesn\'t show the list of killed chessman during game play the only drawback. I am expecting this upgradation and this will be the perfect Android chess.',
       'For the non experts, let me tell you that 5his game cheats. I sat with a real chessboard to analyse why wasn\'t I  able to crack master level.   And what i observed was it didn\'t allow you to make actual moves when you show high levels of intell8gence. Sometimes it makes moves which are faulty. I think there is some mistakes in coding, perhaps deliberately made.  So not a fair play but a foul play.',
       'So far it\'s o.k. I like the fact that it is simply a chess game with no fancy sound effects or graphics. I see no real reason to have the higher difficulty levels locked out until they are beaten but they are. I got it to practice with. It is useful for that. It\'s not bad...Just a simple down to earth chess game',
       'The game has been drawn because the other player has no legal move and is not in check. If they can ot move then I win because they cannot move to a legal position. The computer ends the games too early because they cannot be bothered to chase you around the board. You cannot unlock the higher difficulty games because it just says draw.',
       'Not 100% sure how that works but the other person has their king and it\'s a stale mate and I have practically most of my pieces but to unlock harder levels I have to win. Does stalemate not count? I think its pretty stupid' ,

      'Yes this is addictive, yes it\'s fun, and it\'s great because you can spend 12 seconds or 12 minutes on it and still get the same amount of enjoyment. BUT, and this is a very big but, this game is a HUGE drain on your battery. And no, I don\'t have an iPhone - I have a proper phone - a Sony XZ Pro. So it\'s not the weedy battery. No game I have ever played drains the battery away as fast as this game does, so it\'s clearly an issue that I wish they could fix.',
       'Everyone I know plays Cookie Clicker (CC), definitely too much. I absolutely refuse to play Cookie Clicker myself. I am not one to compete over single-player games, so I was looking for something similar, a game that none of my friends play. AdVenture Capitalist (AVC) fit the profile and is a simplified version of CC. I\'m not saying that AVC is more rewarding than CC, but it isn\'t nearly as convoluted. It\'s a simple game for those of us who want to minimize our time spent on phone games.',
       'Not having to have the screen open 24/7 is really good. Can check in on it when I have 2 minutes free and know I am still progressing. My only minus is that there isn\'t much information on how the Valentine\'s day event works',
       'IRRITATING!! Dont waste your money. Game is glitchy. You don\'t get the rewards you earn in events or their so called offer wall. Go ahead and try to contact them. They will blow smoke until you get frustrated enough to uninstall. Developers need some customer service skills.',
       'Nice idle game. The amusing special events are an interesting touch. Sadly the use of supersonicads for free premium currency spoils it greatly as supersonic ads far too frequently incorrectly claim "offer not completed" and then demand an impossible standard of evidence from you when you complain or sometimes just say the gold is awarded but it never appears and you have no recourse.',

      'Annoying vibrations !! The vibrations wen \'being phoned\' is annoying especially if u are as addicted as me and play it at night. They are so loud and I have to stop playing at night and in the day because of the vibrations can u add in a feature in the settings that enables u to turn them off!! Except from that this is the best game ever and I ADORE it!!',
       'Why do u have to pay just to see the picture and the videos? What\'s the point to that? U want us to be addicted to it but some of us can\'t buy it for a reason. Please update this and think about it. I know it\'s a low payment. It u want more people to install it. Please consider this thank u!!',
       'Personally I think the stories are a bit cheesy and there\'s very limited interactivity. Some of the stories I played had no interactivity at all. You have to pay to see photos or videos in the game, which is fair enough, but I wish the game had a set price or charged a small amount for each story. A weekly subscription fee is  too much for me. There is a free 3 day trial though.',
       'Love all of the stories on there, loads of mysteries and some good plot twists. Annoying that you have to pay to see pictures or listen to audio stuff but I just imagine what it\'s like but amazing work',
       'This game is fun, but I did not pay for  the pics because I have no money and plus i do not want to see it as it may be scary. I also did not answer the video calls and the calls because no money and scared to answer it...',
       'First off, unless you want to pay, don\'t play. If you don\'t pay monthly, you will not be able to watch videos, answer calls or video chats, or look at pictures. 😒 You also can\'t skip the fifteen minute wait that pops up every 15 texts or so 😵, and you won\'t be able to get coins. Coins allow you to make certain choices, usually the smarter ones that help you win the game. And while we\'re on the topic of choices, you only make about 2-3 per chapter for each story. Sometimes, you can\'t even make a choice. For more than half the stories, you just read and wait for the people to die. I mean, the concept of the game is great, but ℹ bet that some mediocre app designer could make a new app that is twice as good. 😊 I would try it, but paying probably isn\'t worth it. It\'s a great idea(the concept of a choose your own adventure text story, that is), but the app itself is pretty trashy. Its still fun, just not worth the money. 😋 I know that most of the reviews say that this app is great, but it\'s not really that amazing.' ,

      'Really fun and challenging game nice music and graphics. There is one thing that would be cool if there was a fix for it. I like to listen to audio books when I play and it always turns it off. Is there a work around or fix you can do on that? It does it both on the Samsung 5 and 8 note phones. The music is fun to play with but when I\'m working through a board it\'s fun to play other content through my phone. Thanks.',
       'THIS GAME IS THE BAST!! Usually i dont download games but i saw the ad for this game many times so i just though oh why not. Now that im playing it its sooo awesome! Totally recommend it ppl😊',
       'I really want to love this game but I could barely play a little. I can\'t stand the controls. It\'s really bad. I\'m pretty sure it\'s fine on a phone but it\'s really inconvenient on a 7" device. I\'m disappointed there is no way to choose from other control schemes because the game itself looks fun!  Great visuals, nice music, lively, dynamic levels. Kinda like a 3D Geometry Dash.  I would definitely play it but it\'s so frustrating this way. Dying because of controls again and again...',
       'I love the game, so I bought the unlimited balls upgrade. However, after the most recent update it took away that purchase. Could you either revert this or refund me or something?',
       'This challenges my ability.This is why I love this game. It also has sweet tunes.To improve I think that the different ones need to get harder as you go along. This is what I think:😍😀😚',
       'I think it\'s a good game!👍🏻 A little stressful don\'t you think? My favorite is Hoop Dream level 1. Great job making this. Little on the stressful and hard side but that\'s OK.👍🏻 great graphics. I had 100% NO LAGG! Awsome game. I Love it that means ☆☆☆☆☆ star rating. Best... Game... EVER!!!!!!! 👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻👍🏻☆☆☆☆☆' ,

I hope my tears will help u guys. :)',
       'Maybe some new vehicles? Taxi. Limo. Tow truck. Hearse.... maybe some new stages too? Under water. Race track. Bridges. Derby. Graveyard.  I originally posted this way back in 2015 and yet you said you are constantly improving the game??? We try and give you the developer new ideas but it seems that no one bothers to read our comments? I guess it\'s just a lack of interest. Hopefully this time someone will read it............',
       'Best game ever. I play it all the time even at work but people look at me stupid because im trying to keep from dying and tilting my phone like a moron.. Please make my efforts not be in vain!',
       'Plez put some changes in upgrading options..... Like..when we upgrade our vehicles...... Vehicles should look different...and..some added things like....nitros.,new wheels and etc.... By this changes this game will be liked and can be played by more and more people',
       'At first I wasn\'t sure how good the game was but after playing it several times on Android and Windows 8.1 phone, I like it.  It doesn\'t weigh down on the phone\'s processing power. A very addictive game!! Give it go.',
       'Was good but each new change detracts from the gameplay. Kept hoping it would focus more on adding features to the game play. Multiple paths, more challenging sections, etc. But recent additions just seem to be focused on selling more upgrade packs. Sad.' ,

      'Once you start you can\'t stop. Edit. After 3 years am still addicted to it. But the feb 2018 update is asking too many questions and end of game. Retry button should come back. The hard levels are really hard. Can\'t get through even after 20 attempts',
       'After the last update I have been stuck on a hard level for to days. I like a challenge but this is ridiculous.     I notice that now the game blocks and will not allow you to use the special powers that you earned at the bottom. Also I tried to use my chocolate bars to get more chances it directed me to the store to buy more even thou I already had 46 bars which was enough to buy more moves. Until this is fixed I am going to play other games. I will not buy more bars.',
       'It cost to much money to just keep playing and then you earn stars but have to pay to break open the bank... not a fan of that it\'s kinda really crappy to give hope that you can eat stuff but then it\'s hope gotta fork over hard earned money still even though you earned stars',
       'It\'s a great game to pass time, but I hate the fact that when you loose a level it makes you confirm that you want to give up. When you accidentally hit continue, it automatically take your gold bars. You should have to confirm that aslo....',
       'This is by far my favourite in the Candy Crush series.  But one thing I still despise... the way my gold bars are held hostage in that piggy bank.  I won them fair and square in game.  I don\'t see why I have to buy with real money, something I earned in the game. If y\'all could just quit with that dang piggy bank, you\'d have one mega happy player. Just sayin.  That piggy annoys me.  Just sayin.',
       'I guess you don\'t read what your players write about your game. The update is BAD. Time consuming and unfriendly.  You still han not addressed the issues of players using foul language as their playing name.   I am thinking about getting deleting this app. If you didn\'t want it to be free why offer it as if it was?  There are issues I wish to address.  One issue is that you have allowed players to you swear words as their player name. Please remove this player from my online list that appears on my phone. I find this totally inappropriate. I am supprised you allow this. I play to get away from people who do this type of thing.  Second issue is that you have not fixed my off line play option.  I still have to go on line to open and play the game. This is my second request. Please fix this. Maybe this is my mistake in thinking it had the off line play option.   Thank you for the game play.' ,

      'Game just made to make money. Well of course, all games are like that but other games you can enjoy. I\'m getting offer to buy special packs of gold all the time and that is annoying. Of course Ill buy sone stuff and spend sone money but first I want to make sure game is type of game I want to play for longer time. I also received card to move my base for free. Cool, great thing. So I decided to move my base and there is interesting thing happening. When I choose where I want to teleport I need to pay in gold. When I choose to use free move card I cant choose location. So I ended up using card for nothing and now only option is to earn or buy gold. Is it a bug or made on purpose so that players must buy gold I don\'t know, but I know I\'m deleting game because I want game that I can enjoy more. If you fix this problem let me know and Ill maybe give second chance to game. Anyway its too sad for such a cool game.',
       'Pretty good game with a couple glaring problems.  1) chat in game is toxic, to a point I want to turn it off, sexual harrasment is in full swing  2) way to many clans at the start , this does not promote long term growth or even loyalty.  Needs to be hard set rules you need to be lvl 5 or 6 to even join a clan.',
       'Newbie dont play this game. It\'s was fun at first then you follow the instructions as normal. But at the end of the day you will get stuck and you will run out of supplies.. Their idea is to make you buy.',
       'I notice that there are people who criticised the game for being too violent. Well it\'s a game and that\'s how it is, not everyone enjoys things that are the same. My opinion, good game, a really good game. Few bug issues tho but i love it.',
       'After a week of play , I am getting to attack smaller cities , KILL KILL,  grate time filler,  some sexier clothing options for the (ladies) would be nice,  lots to do and manage, clans mates are important, so chose wisely. I am enjoying this immensely.  Edit after (time seems like forever,)  I am really enjoying this,  Negotiated a couple of Peace Treaties, built my crew and strength, I am getting to be a force to reckon with... But there are still bigger fish, frustrating  Would love a feature to hunt the attacker, but then that would backfire too,   Great game...lots of challenges and opportunities for growth,  Highly recommended   *****',
       'Be a lot better if you didn\'t have to pay so much money to be a contender, if your playing for fun it\'s ok but if you want to be worth a damn be prepared to spend 100s if not 1000s' ,

      'I don\'t think I need to \'review\' much here. There are some points I definitely don\'t like about the game. Such as the matchmaking... You get matched with the same deck type in a row. Other than that and some minor flaws it\'s a great game. I love the competitive aspect about it.  Finally I would suggest some 2v2 with different game modes, such as ramp up 2v2. Also, add the rematch button in 2v2 challenges with random mates.  Hope I hit the 4,3k this season. Good luck to all clashers!',
       'I think Clash Royale is a great game to play and is very well put together for all ages, it is a fast paced game and at the same time can be played with an individual pace of your own to a degree being that there is a clock ticking, also new characters are released at a well balanced rate, so that the game doesn\'t become boring and the regular balance of the characters strengths and weaknesses are balanced to make the game more competitive. I recommend this game for all ages and abilities. It\'s great for a few minutes or an hour or so and this game also has several different tournaments you can enjoy yourself or with a friend or a teammate. See you soon on Clash Royale. A.K.A. Dad.',
       'Supercell, I think your best game is hay day. Clash royale on the other hand isn\'t one of your better games. Android is better than apple. Why would you ever support apple instead of android. You released Brawl Stars only for apple. You should have less medieval/fantasy games unless you make the knights, princes etc. More realistic. In my opinion I think you\'re better at making farm and army games. Please make more of those😖',
       'This is the only game of its kind. Many companies try to copy, but this is the original and the best. There are  endless possibilities of card combos and decks that you could use making the game always entertaining. My only complaint is that the trainer is way too easy to beat. It is one of few games that you could get competitive without using your own 💰. I also like how the stuff that u unlock in the beginning does not go to waste later in the game.',
       'What do we do?  I have been playing this game from 9 months now. In these 9 months i got 3 Legendary Cards 2 from chest and 1 from Clan Chest. But the thing is that all of them were Ice Wizard. I\'m in Arena 9 from 2 months now Because i dont have the cards to win. I check the tv royale every time i open the Game for a good deck But. So Supercell tell me what do i do? I can\'t push to Hog Mountain then what do i do in this game? Please do something',
       'Really a awsome  addictive  game.. but its not a fair play..  It  offered me only one  legendary card as I am playing from the beginning.  In the other hand one of my friend started playing just 4 months ago but he owned 5 legendary cards. one from the crown chest, another from the legendary chest and recently he got another one in the super magical chest. Now you decide. Is it a fair play?.  Really Disappointed 👎. And on the other hand it is pay to win game.. In some cases skill doesn\'t work .' ,

      'So I thought it was a good game to play pretty fun in the down time, but then I purchased the simple 40 gems pack and didn\'t receive my gems at all. I purchased a little person for the same price and it worked instantly. So I went to repurchase the gems in case it didn\'t process right ya know? And it said I couldn\'t purchase this item because I already own it. Like no I don\'t I don\'t have my gems at all. If you want future purchases I suggest this be fixed as soon as possible.',
       'It\'s a great game and a good time waster. The only problems that I have is that it takes forever to do any missions because you have and extreme limited food supply and money supply. To get either or you have to spend either actual money or it takes many hours to collect enough money to do even one part of a mission or enough food to do part of the mission. Other than that I enjoy the game it keeps me entertained for short periods of time',
       'Very fun game. Takes really long to accumulate coins coz they limit the buildings that produce them. Also DO NOT like how it\'s so Facebook oriented. For someone like me who doesn\'t have FB a lot of the bonuses and extras aren\'t available to me and I can\'t use my own picture or name.',
       'I  like this game, but it requires A LOT of purchases of the gem packages in order to progress. It takes a long time to make headway and the rewards are not enough to motivate the player. If you are impatient this is NOT a great game choice. If you are on a budget, also not a great choice! You can legitimately spend hundreds of dollars buying gems to make a tiny amout of progress. Warning, it is addictive and you will be tempted to buy the gems!!!',
       'While the game is fun, it\'s also a game to avoid. The developers are out to make money. If you spend real money to buy gems, you waste them because no prompt comes up before using them. Second, pop ups come up wanting you to spend $$ in buying packs and there is no prompts to warn you if you click on an pop up by accident and the developers refuse to give any refund. Beware if playing this game!!',
       'I downloaded this game because in the previews it showed different puzzles. (Ex. Coloring, actual puzzles)  but when i opened it up turns out it was just another click and wait game which I absolutely hate. I\'ve been playing it for a while now hoping the puzzle aspect of the game would show up later but nope have yet to find it. All I can say is false advertisement . Will update if anything changes. But that won\'t be for long time seeing as its a fricken click and wait game-,-' ,

      'I love this game.  It\'s very simple, just go without getting hit by glass or running out of balls, but it is a lot harder than it sounds.  I am forever telling myself I have time for just one more attempt, it is very addicting.  The 3d design on this is amazing and creative.  Up at the top it says to write a SHORT review, so this will end here.',
       'Excellent game. Really superb game. Engaging play and the music works well. Plus fantastic breaking sounds. This game is both addictive and relaxing. Reminds me of the original wipeout. Another cool element is that each level adds interesting new elements. Only thing that would make it better is if my acheivements would track. Im on a galaxy s 7, and they don\'t track. At least my checkpoints save.',
       'I came across this app while I was browsing for more games. Looks very well designed and I\'ve decided to make room for this app. The very first time I played this game my mind was literally blown. Awesome music, fantastic design/graphics and very creative gameplay. It gave me a very good first impression that within 30 minutes into the game I\'ve upgraded to premium. The different game modes accomodate various type of players. The challenges are reasonable. Literally every aspect of this game is a success. The premium upgrade is worth every cent. Who need ads if you can give a very good first impression. A simple yet sophisticated game. Very well done indeed, a must for time killer!',
       'Really fun and addicting! The first time i saw this app was when my dad told me about this game, he said that it was very good. Literally the first 10 minutes i played this game my mind was blown and i beacame addicted. Around 2 years later(now) i found this game again and instantly installed it. I love this game and I have played it for a long time. The graphics and music are amazing. This a really good game and you should install it! Who could think that glass could be so fun. However I think this game would be better if some of the thing you have to pay for would be for free.',
       'So fun Great graphics and its super fun and addictive especially if you like beating your own score. I gave 4 stars because I paid the 2 dollars for the full version but I find that it doesn\'t save where I\'m at very well... Like if I leave the game and come back to it the last level I completed won\'t be saved. Other than that its really awesome and challenging. Hope I can get past level 8!',
       'It\'s very addictive, one thing I am pod about is that right from the get-go they\'re trying to get you to pay for it . It would have been nice if they didn\'t try to sell the premium version so quick. If anybody could have tried any other levels without being intimidated to pay for premium maybe I would have been sold to buy a premium. As of right now I\'m okay with playing classic. Maybe I\'ll think about premium ..' ,

      'So I\'m changing my review. After the past few updates I have won more special dice!! They lowered the level from extra impossible to meduim on the dice Masters, so it\'s a tad bit more fair! The only problem need, is the daily challenge is too much for the app to stay open. It force closes due to over processing or something, and I\'d rather not have the daily challenge and the game work lol. But definitely gaining more stars each update from me!!',
       'Too many ads, basically requires you to buy dice. Literally the only way to ensure a win is to have dice for re-rolls. This wouldn\'t be a problem except you\'ll hardly ever win dice with the scratchers, and when you do it\'ll be one.  It\'s all a cash grab, and the ads every 3 or 4 rolls are intrusive, frequently locked in, and always very annoying. Gameplay itself is simple but just way too many ads.',
       'The rating would be higher if I didn\'t have an app stopping every throw of the dice for a solid week.  My score suffered drastically,  so be yours....',
       'I have been playing both . I am playing old version. I like better .I will go back to the new version to play challenges ..roll a few dice ...it seems to have slower game play .  .new versions gets  glitches . Keeps crashing .. that\'s annoying ??..! ? Time to keep playing on the old version..if you want to try new version just install separate .  New version you push to roll and then there is a 1 or 2. Second delay . To slow',
       'I would totally give this game 5 stars it is a great game and i love playing. But it keeps crashing. It crashes and restarts in the middle of my roll!!! Its very irritating and if it keeps doing it i will uninstall the game.',
       'Honestly, I adore Yahtzee, but this app has FAR too many ads.  These ads cause the game to severely lag, making for very unenjoyable gameplay.  I understand that app-makers get their money out of free apps only because of the ads, but this is just beyond ridiculous and completely ruins the fun of the game.' ,

      'Hello I\'ve been playing this game for months, so much so that I began to pay to play it. In October of 2017 I had a late payment that resulted in me loosing my VIP status. However; My bank account reflected withdrawals of 9.99 for game plays from October 2017 until January 2018. Google was able to give my money back for January but I have to now contact the Administration of this game in order to be reimbursed for previous months. I love playing this game but I will no longer pay to play anymore.  I will keep you all posted on my outcome.',
       'the game does too many resets, all on its own. i can be in the middle of a game, and the game will stop in mid-stream, then start a new game, and causing me to lose not only what i have "won", but will set me all the way back to the bronze box, or, in the case of special games, such as the winter sports 2018, back to the red box, when i actually finished and won the silver medal. the game can be veeerrrrryyyy slooooooooow, and often is. i enjoy the show when i get a chance to watch it, but am not so sure about the game. it would also be nice if there were instructions on how to play the features that are *not* in the tv show...',
       'Used to love this game!! Never purchased anything just did the free play. I received a Google play card for Christmas and decided to buy 400 diamonds. An ad popped up asking me if I wanted to buy a mystery Santa box for 1 diamond I did and it took my 400 diamonds!! I then was given 40 diamonds on the lifetime list for winning a certain amount of shows... when the game refreshed my 40 diamonds were gone?! Fix the bugs!!!!',
       'THEY OFFERED A FREE TRIAL FOR 7 DAYS IN WHICH THEY GIVE YOU DOUBLE COINS AND A FEW OTHER PERKS. I CANCELED WITHIN THE 7 DAY PERIOD SO I WOULD NOT BE CHARGED AND THEY STILL CHARGED MY CARD.  I HAVE BEEN REQUESTING A REFUND FOR ALMOST A WEEK ALREADY AND THEY ARE GIVING THE RUN AROUND.  I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED AND WOULD NOT RECOMMEND THIS UNLESS YOU HAVE FREE MONEY TO GIVE AWAY.',
       'Extremely laggy, ads do not always close, and the game freezes or closes itself very often. It almost exclusively does that while in a game, so you automatically lose. The inbox always says there\'s 1 more message than there actually is. And sometimes hitting "play" closes the app instead of starting a game. Complete waste of time.',
       'UPDATED: Big shoutout and thanks to the Google Support Team for doing an awesome job refunding my in-app purchases in a timely fashion. Scopely could learn from those folks.  Overall? This game does not work as intended or advertised. I am honestly disappointed by this product, as I enjoy other Scopely titles. Post-match, the game does not connect to Scopely\'s servers and that makes game progress impossible. Further, Scopely\'s support team closed my help ticket less than 24 hours after submission without giving any actual support at all. I am strongly considering going completely free-to-play on other titles by this publisher, and have requested refunds on my in-app purchases from Google.' ,

      'Game is fun. Dont even mind spending money in gens every now and again. But seriously to get the outcome you want, this app is charging waaaaaaay too many gems. Like 50 for one simple choice. And its goes up higher depending on the amount of gems you have. If I pay $5.99 for like 60 gems.. that should get me through and entire story. Not just one chapter. Will delete app if they dont change it. Not gonna spend $40 to finish a story.. Sorry but I think thats outrageous.',
       'The stories seem great so far, the app is really nice. But the limiting of how much you can "read" is way over the top. Two short chapters and then a 4 hour wait to get another two. Or buying more chapter tickets. All the actually fun choices are also gated behind premium currency. If it was even a bit less limiting, it would be great. As it is, its fun but annoying.',
       'This game is really fun! I wish there was a way to restart a story that you are in the middle of or that you could change your appearance or other people\'s appearence at any time. Also when you decide what your character is wearing, sometimes you can\'t see it because dialog is in the way. Also when you choose what you look like. I would prefer it to be against a white background. It\'s hard to see what the darker colors look like.',
       'Really fun, the animation style is adorable but the waiting time is killer! Two short chapters, then you have to wait a ridiculously long amount of time to be able to play more unless you pay. Also the best story options are only available through micro transactions to get more gems to unlock the ability to make certain choices',
       'I think this game is awesome, I would recommend it but not if you don\'t like waiting for tickets to be able to play it. Personally, I don\'t mind waiting and think the stories are totally worth it. I would like to have more free tickets and I think we shouldn\'t have to use diamonds. It\'s unfair to make us pay for the outcome we want- it\'s episode, we want to actually choose how the story goes! Also, you should be able to put glasses on characters without them looking like geeks. Overall tho, great game',
       'Enjoying this games app but the weaknesses is WAITING TIME for the passes to refill again. Not to forget, it require a lot of gems to choose fabulous dialogue i want. Last, If it does not include a REAL money, it will be more pleasure. I really enjoy this game to fill my freetime & looking forward to finish the story, so i really hope on later update, the passes will refill more quickly & there is no need for money maybe.' ,

      'This game is very fun.  My only concern is when I level up my character I am supposed to receive my level up gift.  Multiple times it says I have received $1,000 cash or 5+ rockets, but when I look at my collected items it was not put into my collection.  This rating can easily be a 5 star but the fact that I am not receiving my level up rewards makes it a 3 star.  I hope it is just a flaw in the system, and that it is not a technique you are using to force me to buy gold bars.',
       'It\'s a great game. Easy to learn but hard to master. Obviously no money is needed but it definitely helps you move through the game faster. If you don\'t want to spend money, quit complaining and stop sucking. Just "fine tune your skills". Honestly my only complaint is consistency with the pumps and the speed it gives you and the up arrow sometimes seems like it didn\'t register but that could just be the calibration on my phone. But overall fun and challenging game. Download this for sure.',
       'It\'s a fun game, physics are good, but my good does it get hard. I have progressed only a few levels over the last week. Some levels you have to hit everything perfect. One little mistake and the whole race is lost.   Aside from that it seems very difficult to aquire gold which is required for some upgrades. This worries me that they are trying to force you to purchase gold, otherwise why would they even have that separate currency?  Both Mad Skills Motocross games are great, this game makes me concerned that Mad Skills Motocross 3 will be more pay to win.',
       'Good game in concept.. the problem I found is that you need to be quite exceptional with the controls to beat the computer opponents.. 1 mistake and you will have to start over as your opponent will just glide through the course with great speed! Needs to be more user friendly in my opinion.',
       'Ok so i see a reply from turborilla saying that they dont limit your play and can unlock everything for free but how are u supposed to get more gold which is used to upgrade speed for bikes which is the purchased currency? Other than that it\'s fun . Also if you say that watching trailers earns you free gold I wouldn\'t know because it gave me the wait for 4 hours to be able to get what you need to progress in the game.',
       'Awesome game to play, but bring back the SWIPE controls from the first game (atleast as an controls option). As it is frustrating when your idiotic manuals but you only want him to pump. MAKE THE MANUAL BUTTON SEPARATE TO THE PUMP.' ,

      'The ghosts costumes. They become turkeys  when Pacman eats an energizer.  Getting buggy. Constantly ignores commands.. No matter what difficulty rating.  Game should be harder, not hard to control. Ghosts could be faster or  not turn blue so long... The controls kinda suck.',
       'This game is great, but the controls suck. It always gets stuck and goes the opposite direction. Also, I expected ads but it\'s ridiculous that they automatically pause my game and pop up. Most of the time, I accidentally click the ads and it exits the app because the ads are so unexpected.',
       'controls keep laggin its hard to change directions and the ads make the game intolerable!!! Also I win sometimes in challenges like today the love maze but I didn\'t get any coins! i was supposed to get the highest reward but no! why? coz game is shite',
       'They have added so much junk to this arcade classic, that it\'s virtually unplayable. I just wanted to play some classic pac-man, not do daily missions and challenges. This is not Pac-Man, this is like Pac-Man Reborn or something.',
       'It is a great distraction. I play knowing that I can be completely taken away from me having to deal with boredom or anxiety. In life it really plays a big role in the scheme of things. People probably think that I am texting someone. Makes it kind of like a very good thing to appreciate.',
       'In think this game is still pretty good. Yeah, sure its got those daily challenges and stuff, but you know its fine with me. You still get to play the classic mode, and still get a better variety of maps to play on! Also, BANDAI NAMCO Entertainment America Inc. I love your game! I really do! Would you give me a special response please! I\'m a big fan my whole family is! Well good job on the game! Live Long, Love the Classics!' ,

       'After I posted my recent comment, there were some angry comments pointed out at me. I apologise for that. I mean, this game in great! There are some outfits that are locked and you have to wait too long, and that is why I rated it 4 stars. For someone who says "too many notifications", go to the settings and turn off that notifications button. Thank you for those hate critics you guys made. It really teached me a lesson.',
       'It\'s been more than a year that you haven\'t added any mini game in any update. You\'ve written on "What\'s New" section that "We\'re working on something big" but you .haven\'t shown that big work yet😅..At least add more mini games...And I\'ll rate 5.',
       'This game is so much fun!!! I laugh so hard,  who knew playing with your pooh can be so fun and hilarious,  who ever has a GOOD sense of humor had to download this APP!!! Lots of laughs,  p.s. talk into the Mic and he talks back to you,  who ever created this is a genius, kid at heart 😁😊🤗',
       'Literally everything about this game is AMAZING. The game is bright and colorful and simple too use. The little mini games are cute and fun to do when I have extra time. I love how it takes really long for the Pou to grow up, its fun to see him grow up!! Honestly, my favorite simulation game out there. Would recommended to anyone and everyone!!! Thanks for making this awesome game!!!  ^-^ ❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤❤^-^ (Btw anyone who reads this, its pronounced "Pow" not Poo)' ,

      'Am I missing something? It says relaxed game of 8 ball but all I get are table after table of balls laid out in patterns. I\'d really like to play a game of 8 ball and not just practice shots. The pics shown with the numbered balls with a POV perspective do not exist in the game. View is straight down on unnumbered balls.',
       'It\'s not horrible by any means but it\'s basically the children\'s version of what the game should be. Way to basic way too easy and no points and buying system or any sort of upgrades every level just diffs with amount of balls and placement not difficulty Thanks',
       'I played without sound for a long time. After Upgrading my tablet, the sound won\'t turn OFF!   I have it off in the settings but am still getting sound after sinking a shot and at the end of a game.  I am very dissappointed that i wont be able to play this app anymore.',
       'I enjoy playing this game. I already reach level 400 but i don\'t know how many levels this game have. Do you increase the levels every time you update this game until it reach to never ending levels so that no one will stop playing this game because of the never ending levels. This game is fun and challenging.',
       '1st there are ads in between each play which is ridiculous.. I dont know how high the game goes up but there are NO hints or instructions on what exactly the goal is besides potting balls.. it\'s ADDICTIVE and fun BUT if this is all there is to it I won\'t keep game long',
       'I REALLY REALLY 💋💝💋💝🎉🎉 LUV THIS GAME!!  I\'M A 64YR. YOUNG GMAMA (SMILE).  I COULD PLAY A WICKED GAME BACK IN THE DAY!!!! I BEAT MANY A BRAGGING DUDE,. LOL!!!  THX 4 GAME!!  KUDOS TO ALL OF U!!!' ,

The other games are good and addictive but the problem is only it that game... Pls fix it and it the games often hangs up and after 2 or 3 secs it recovers back... Pls help it and make the games better and fun',
       'Used to be fun, at least for the variety.  But now it\'s so worthless and laggy that it\'s unplayable. Its Not my phone, not my connection. It\'s your garbage app. make 7 is the only good game on here and the stand alone version on Google play is lame and worthless. Good job sucking' ,

      'I love the game. the game play itself is very self explanatory, quick and very good fps however, they have scammed me. I spent 12.99 on gbucks, the purchase was confirmed, and right after they asked me if i had liked to submit another card number for another purchase. I recall having credentials on a different prepaid visa card in my notes, so I go look, unfortunately I didn\'t have the CVS code for it. I go back to the game, it had reloaded but I didn\'t get my gbucks. I was a little confused as the purchase had been confirmed, and the money was taken off my card. I tried contacting them 3 separate times about it but obviously they aren\'t vigilant of their customers and don\'t take them as a priority. I recommend playing the game but avoid spending money on it. If I could get some help and get a refund on my card, or the gbucks I originally paid for, I will give it 5 stars, as I would like to.',
       'I REALY LOVE this game but the only thing is that I\'m on level 10 and when ever I play in a battle and win I only get 200 gun bucks. PLZ can I have money transported to my account.My name is PRO_ADMIN.I would REALY HAPPY if you do😕.By the way this is also for my FAMILY and they would love it if you do ):  . I am only 10 and I know I\'m asking for you to do a big thing but my family would really be happy😊.My brother\'s acount is PROGAMER and he is only 6. PLZ if you don\'t reply or do something then it\'s ok ):  .',
       'I was loving it and have spent alot of money but this update made it to where i can\'t even open it back up. Please fix because i loved this game and have invested time and money and if i don\'t get to play it anymore sometime soon I\'m not coming today back. Please fix very soon i was trying earn a special gun but I\'m not sure if that\'ll be an option if an when it gets fixed',
       'After the Pro Play update, the game is a massacre. Unbalanced matchmaking rules the system. Players from better league confront newbies matches. I should have fight with players in my league. But the Pro Play update changes it to an unbalanced match. Now you lose two stars from my review. Please remove the Pro Play or replaced it as a ranked match. That would be better. Because ranked matches takes you against players in your league. Please fix this issue immediately so I\'ll change my reviews to 5.',
       'After level 30 the game is pay to win and after that level at least 90% of the battles the teams are unbalance. Pay vs free to play player. It is like if you don\'t use real money the game is punishing you with a handicap. Your armor and gun become less effective. If you are not planning to spend money on this game do NOT waste ur time.👎',
       'Lunar festivals guns are a betrayal. You keep collecting cards to try your luck at the rulette but guess what... The card with the 300 pieces comes at last!!! I even bought cards with real money to confirm that and now i know. I am going to continue playing this game but you guys are not getting a cent from me anymore...;) Cheers...' ,

For whatever reason, I can open to play for a little while, but when I go back in a short time later it won\'t load past the initial "loading" screen. It\'s not my connection nor my phone which is a Note 8.   Not sure if anyone else is having the same issue or not. If they are, please fix it quickly.',
       'This game is great! There are so many opportunities to get big wins, the time bonuses are huge, and you are able and climb the level faster than other games. It will be able the keep you interest for a long time.',
       'I love this game. It\'s addicting and all the slots are fun to play with amazing payouts... my only issue is that I run out of chips so fast and it takes so long before you get the free chips',
       'Buyer beware. Bought $19.99 coin pack during "guaranteed 3x wheel event" only received 2x on wheel, currently have a ticket open with support, if not rectified will be reporting to google. And the raking over the coals continues, since last update most of my lucky spin levels have been downgraded to silver, such great value for sapphire vip tier. Buy coins watch them get sucked away, rinse and repeat. You\'ll be lucky to get 2 spins from your bonus at sapphire level.',

      'The whole concept of the game is very interesting. But the game has way too many glitches due to ads and maybe the new update. This game can literally give someone cardiac arrest because you could be about to get a goal and then the game just freezes. Lol.',
       'This game beats the whole purpose of dumb ways to die. It\'s meant to be a game with mini games after mini games. Not ads and points and avatars and money and everything complicated! Deleting and getting the original.',
       'The adverts ruin this game, so many pop ups. Also the availability to watch adverts for digital item.. need to watch 30 of the 20sec ads.. who even had this spare time to do this? The game itself is great though but I\'m uninstalling because of what I mentioned above.',
       'The game is great. But a lot of annoying ads are ruining it. I understand the ads, where you receive coins or where you speed up things, but ads every 3 times when you die are just ruining the app. Hope to update this policy, so one can see ads only when it will give you credits or anything else!',
       'THE ADDS ARENT THAT BAD, STOP PINING! THEY GIVE U FREE STUFF THAT HELP U INGAME! And most adds are likt 15 seconds. I quite enjoy this game.I cant help but laugh every time my beanpeople die. I feel kinda baf, but then i cant contain myself. This game is a great time killer! Its hilarously addictive. Its not too easy but not overwhelmingly hard, its like just the right amount of difficult.  I hope they keep adding new characters!',
       'I think the game is amazing. I love the style of the game, the graphics are amazing and a great time killer. My only problem is on the minigame Pyramid Dash, I fall of nearly straight away when I lay a foot off the edge. Overall great game.  😊 Creators, you did a great job. 😋🙂' ,

      'Keeps interrupting for ratings. Some games crash regularly during bonuses or do not start. Also, unless you\'re spending billions, it\'s nearly impossible to finish quests because the games are way too tight and seem to be getting tighter. Too many free spins where you win nothing or less than your bet. Slot games are only fun if there is a good balance between winning and losing. Slotomania seems to have lost that balance.',
       'Everything works wonderfully on this app. Wish the payouts were a little better , run out of coins quite frequently and can\'t play til bonus coins are available. If you like spending money on these type of games this app would be perfect. Like the extra content that goes along with the games! Thanks Creator\'s !',
       'Ok since you keep interrupting​ games to beg for a rating, here is one. Trading in cards to try to get coins to play I got a whopping 13 mil after 25 cards. BS. As is the fact I can blow thu literally billions and barely get a jackpot... Liked a lot better when you could at least hit something. Way to tight.',
       'I just reinstalled this game the thinking I was getting the free 120 free spins.  I haven\'t played in a long time so I thought if I installed it on my phone it would be there, but apparently I never got them. So there are some catches one of them being a totally new account.... Go figure 😒',
       'For a while i could not figure out why this app was number 1.    I know why now. Lol 5 stars that shine brighter than the rest. Playing for months and i wish i could have good luck long enough to finish a quest. Losing one right now that would have had benifits the rest of the year. *sigh* i am level 1197 and still i get shut down every quest and event?',
       'If you are into paying a lot of money to play a just for fun game then this is for you. Once you purchase once they literally hold hostage to spend more or you don\'t have any fun. I used to play everyday but I found a different game that\'s way less expensive to occupy my time.' ,

       'The ads are ever increasing, I don\'t pay for games and being forced more and more is a deterrent to continue playing. Turn it down a notch.... edit to developer reply...that doesn\'t explain why more and more ads are popping up. What was wrong with it before?  Getting greedy with get you nowhere.',
       'It\'s a fun game, great for passing the time. That being said it suffers some very problematic connection issues, if I tab away for even half a second it disconnects me and causes and auto loss',
       'I thought it was a really good game and very addictive. I wish that instead of you losing when you\'re connection is down the game should carry on until you join again. I\'ve lost loads of battle\'s that where going really well then lose connection and it won\'t reconnect so I get a loss. Also there are loads of ads.',
       'Ranking system is horrible,  to many game options make matching a hassle.  Defence mode is to hard to play even though its made to be like single player, very discouraging.  Then when you get into it the game it crashes.  This happens frequently, very upsetting I don\'t know how this game has a 4.4 star rating.  It also throws ads at you randomly as well as has pay to win with  the ability to buy metals.  One or the other please.  Not made for the player at all.' ,

      'I love the game. From its cute and addictive style to its unique and original dress up gameplay, it turned me from a dress up hater to lover. But I feel like there\'s a Paywall especially during events, and diamonds are forced to be bought, but they can be earned, which is good. But so far, you seem to have listened to feedback, from the skin tones to the bug fixes. But I love it still.',
       'In depth in both gameplay and attention to details of awarded items. Continuous hours not required but with once a day of incentive activities. Controls are  sometimes unstable. If a glitch does happen, its fixed fast and your also awarded for time spent. Very happy customer. Enjoyed the best dress up game I\'ve played so far. Thank you makers!',
       'I had seen many ads for it and was kind of interested, but I didn\'t think a dress-up game could be that fun. One day I couldn\'t find any games I wanted to play, so I decided to give it a shot. To my surprise, I am really enjoying it! So if you\'ve had any inkling of interest in this game, give it a shot. You might enjoying as much as I have.',
       'I love this game. I don\'t really like these types of games but to my surprise I like this one. I have a suggestion, may you please allow the hairstyle double pony tails to be dyed into a dark purple (like the reddish purple colour you can dye the ace hairstyle)',
       'I love it... I know I\'m not the age range who gets into dress up but God I love this... also can you make the the events a little easier I know you want paying people but I don\'t  A. Have money B. Or a credit card  So in all its kind of hard for me to get anything as my parents think it\'s a waste of time... and it probably is but you know it just is so fun and the stories cute to...',
       '*LOVE IT!*  Awesome game. Just one question though. Why did you change some of the names? \'Bobo\' was \'Yoko\'. \'Haru\' is now \'Bai Jinjin\' , and her boyfriend is now \'Zhong Lizi\' . To be honest, I just don\'t understand. I absolutely love this game, though. Please note. However, I did uninstall it because AVG told me that it had malware?' ,

      'The game has been majorly revamped and has benefited from it. It\'s so much better to see that content and events are happening more often. Hopefully we\'ll see the first wave of gen 4 by April or May and a nice egg event will happen to get a higher chance of a baby Pokemon from gen 4. Keep up the great work only downside is legendaries. I can\'t get them as not enough people in my area play Pokemon go and I\'m not travelling for a Pokemon. Can we have a legendary event for one week you can get 3* legendary raids? That would make it easier.',
       'I like the game, I was a bit worried to get it when it came out at first, but after installing it and learning how it generally works I like it a lot. I would love to see more pokemon added and maybe even some PvP/ being able to challenge other people around you some day. So far it\'s been great, I\'m not really sure why so many people have been so upset about it, but it\'s definitely a 5/5 for me so far.',
       'Constantly saying GPS not found (11). She jumps to random places and takes forever to even move. Its basically useless.. I was going to get a new phone to play this thinking it would work better but even after the update it hasn\'t changed. Waste all my data trying to play. Not happy. Disappointed.',
       'It is a fine game to play, if you want to waste time. Obviously, it is different from main pokemon game series. However, if you can\'t get the main series game(even through emulator), this is a alright game in my opinion to replace it. The raid boss is a pretty interesting concept and with the new wave of pokemons coming in, I would say the game has made progress for the better over the months. With raids, new generation of pokemons introduces and events.  However, there are some bugs in the newest update(with some from the lld update getting fixed). For instances, I did not receive any pokecoins from the gym despite my pokemon being there for more than 8 hours. And even when it said my pokemon have return with pokecoins, the pokecoins were not added to my balance of pokecois. So there is that.  Overall, the game is decent. Definitely better than it was before. However, there are many things it could improve on. So I am hoping for such improvements in the future.',
       'Tried it...Loved It! It\'s a game I can enjoy with my 8 yr old. More addicting than I thought it\'d be & I\'m 48 yrs old. I love the part where you walk & get rewarded while you do it. It can be disappointing when  eggs hatch and its a repeat monster but the candy you need to maximize it works itself out in the long run.',
       'Requires constantly lookong at the screen(unsafe while walking on street). Doesn\'t count steps traveled unless application is actively in use. No rural support. Not enough pokestops or gyms in my area parks or other public areas that are safe to access. No player vs player combat. No trading. Doesn\'t really seem like a Pokemon game, more of a gimmick.' ,

      'This is the best game in the world. srsly if this was the only game on my ipad then i will be happy. As soon as you get onto the game you just cant put it down. The only down side is that the spins cost alot of coins and those coins can be hard to earn. So 4.5 stars i would rate it is that was a option but its not so i rate it a a big fat 5',
       'this game is the bomb. it is stupid that they asked you is this game beautiful, of course not, people die, and crack their necks, backs, and shoulder blades. This game all in all soooooooo fun and you should totally get it. just say no if you want to write a reaport on this game because it will ask you is this game is beautiful which it is not. GOOD LUCK, good  night, new york city. at late night talk show with stephen colebert......jk',
       'Whatever they did last update broke the game for me, this is why I never buy anything in these games. No way to contact anyone to resolve any problems.  Game gets boring anyway',
       'I love this game a lot. The only problem is that when you do the Dailey spin, you only get like coins. And then with the coins you can buy another spin which is what I do. And I get even more coins. It\'s really rare to get  locations or characters.    Please change that so we get Moore chances to get good prizes  But this is a very fun game and',
       'It\'s a really good game and works really well. The only thing I don\'t like is how the cost of the daily spin goes up every time. It is quite annoying. Other than that I really enjoy playing this game. Great job guys😀',
       'Great game! I just hate that there\'s loads of ads on there and you have to pay to get rid of them. It\'s not fair that I am a kid either cause I don\'t have my own money. That\'s the only downside. But anyway, yeah, great game!' ,

      'This game was great until the most recent update now I dont play as much. Only being able to save 25 cupcakes when before tgere was no limit IS terrible! I\'ve purchased boost to pass a level & several times when I\'ve used them the game freezes so I lose the boost. I contacted customer service got a generic response & no refund but they want me to rate their service 🤔 no thanks! I loved the game before but not so much now!!',
       'Would of gave full marks but on a few cooking appliances when I tap on it doesn\'t work. Second I think it would help if you could carry money over from one country to another and convert currency. Some of the levels are hard to achieve and you don\'t earn enough power ups and spoons to help you through the levels plus restore lives take ages. Customer waiting is to quick.',
       'Was a great,  fun game,  but now with the new Update things will not download.  I\'ve sent emails to them and nothing has change.  I did receive an email back asking to rate their and of course I told them you don\'t want me to rate something I never received!!  Can\'t open game,  this issue has gotten worse!!😡',
       'I LOVE IT!!  Very addictive & challenging. My only problem is that I accidentally uninstalled it while removing games from my tablet that I no longer play. I had just reached level 50 so now I have to start all over again. Fortunately this is one game I don\'t mind doing that with!!',
       'Great for passing time and the graphics are pretty. Only thing I wish is that you would give us something to do with our coins. For example I\'ve maxed out all levels in New York, I have 71k coins there and nothing to do with them since everything is fully upgraded. Thoughts?',
       'I have one major issue. I cannot get Big Fish customer support to use the email I was to use. I have a second email that I don\'t use anymore but they insist on using it. On the second email, I am almost done with Bangkok. On my chosen email I have to restart in New York with nothing! None of my purchases, coins, levels, or achievements are synchronized, which are into the hundreds of thousands coins, almost all levels available, all achievements available, and a amount of money in each city! So very frustrating! Other than that it is a terrific game.' ,

      'I really lived thus game because it isn\'t just tapping something but it\'s actually training your brand and improving your attention, memory, logic and your mind in general. If you need help in any of those subjects (or you just like a bit of fun ) I would dwfinately say this is the game for you.',
       'Very great game, I can pic some logic questions here and ask it on my friends ang classmates. It really gives me a brain exercise. Wheneve I feel bored, this game takes my bored away',
       'Simple but fun. These games are challenging and do make you use your brain without taking much time. You can play a few levels in just a few minutes easily. Ads are not too bad either, not too obtrusive and are sporadic enough.',
       'Cool game, but it has a few bugs. The one where items go through some thing and one of them gets lost - it doesn\'t show me the items going into the thing so all I can do is guess.',
       'Grrrrrrrreat for ppl who use their brain for the right reason. Theres To many idiots around nowadys it\'s like being stuck in that movie idiocracy I swear.',
       'Too many ads plus its deaigned to get you invested with easier puzzles and then make them next to impossible unless you use gems.  Guess how you get gems: by watching more ads or spending money.  Otherwise good game.  Haha.' ,

      'This is actually quite addictive & enjoyable. Definitely distracts you & helps kill time or zone out when your brain is too busy. My daughters, (16 yrs & 5 yrs) along w my son (12 yrs) play w me, and we try to race each other thru the levels. I would give this wee game 5 stars if it weren\'t for the amount of ads & the length of time the ads play. If the ads were adjusted a wee bit it would be easier to do the side by side races. Hope y\'all 👍 it.',
       'I abseloutly love this game. The controls are amazing the games are great and it is so stress relieving and I would play this in every second of my spare time. I would totally reccomend this for kids and adults!!! Go and get this free app that I am addicted to 😀😍',
       'Only play it offline. Otherwise the only thing it\'s good for is helping you test out what kind of games you\'d like most, so you can find other apps with the puzzles you like that have less annoying ads!!! Never had an app give so many pop ups',
       'Proper sick, proper sound, having dreams about half the puzzles it\'s THAT addictive, had quite a quality one where I was in NJ and I was the PuzzleDon because I could just do all the puzzles proper well and am not even American, 10/10 would recommend just for the dreams tbh',
       'GREEDY DEVELOPERS!😤 I loved it! But... All the good games, have point pay-walls! Not to mention that there are ads. ADS EVERYWHERE!!! SO ANNOYING!!! I KNOW THIS IS HOW YOU MAKE 🤑, BUT NEVER FROM ME AGAIN!',
       'This game is full of great little brain teasers. Not too difficult, not too easy. All in all, a great way to kill some time, without mindlessly gunning down zombies.' ,

      'LOVE the things you\'ve added! I\'m over level 1000 so I expect the levels to kind of be repeated but it was getting boring. Now it\'s fun again! If there\'s not a match, we don\'t have to use the toy we chose for that game now (rocket, bomb etc) that is awesome! New toy chest with good prizes, not just rockets, when you get to 20. Thanks a lot! Maybe I\'ll even finish lol!',
       'This is one of the best games ever. It also has some adorable scenes and graphics. I only wish for one thing to be fixed. That would be that you could push on the map on the screen and scroll through all the levels and see the different scene titles. The map option isn\'t there now so you can still scroll through levels but you don\'t know what the names of each episode is.',
       'This could be a good game if there wasn\'t so much cheating during competitions within the game. Go up 900 levels in a few days the highest levels? The developers see nothing wrong with this. I think it\'s used by them to get us to spend $$$$. Oh well....too bad.',
       'Too much cheating going on in tournaments. I can\'t see how first place got over 400 stars in 4 hours and right when the tournament is about to end. And I\'m at level 748 That\'s not possible to move up that quickly. At this level it very difficult to move up so quickly even with coins and boosters.',
       'I wish i could give 0 star. I used to love this game more then anything else i am on level 868 and all my power ups/ boosters are gone ? What the hell. I save alot of them and you took all of them i hate it now i hate it soo much. Cheaters',
       'So much fun! I love thos game. My only gripe with the latest update is that I can no longer see the names of each area. Other than that, the game is magic! Can\'t wait to reach max level!' ,

      'At long last, the game is now working and the text is now intact. Now I love the game, with its graphics and frame rate are fluid, the combat is likely the same as the first one on the PSP while inheriting the turn-based battle system of the past, and all of my favorite characters from the SNES games up to the latest are here! Great game SQUARE! But it\'s a shame that there is no English voice over to the characters though. I\'ll love this one even more if you\'ve thought about it SQUARE.',
       'So close to perfect. The game is beautiful and plays like a good mix of old Final Fantasy and the Dissiadia games. The only problem is that the pricing in game is insanely high. You can\'t even buy one single weapon $1. If they dropped the prices then I would probably have already given them money. At least all the characters are free.',
       'Absolutely amazing. I can safely call this an actual game that you can play. There is no energy that stupidly limits play time, you can unlock all available characters by playing the game, and it actually FEELS like a true Final Fantasy game! I love this game and I am definitely going to spend money in the future to show my support for this amazing game.   However, since this game is fairly new, there isn\'t much to do. You definitely need to add more quests, more characters, more events, and PvP. Real-time PvP would be amazing. This is truely an spectacular game, and I highly recommend it for any Final Fantasy fan. Also, Cloud is available near the start of the game! Big thumbs up. Please don\'t screw around with energy Square Enix, please as it is a plague in the mobile gaming business.  EDIT: Please increase the level cap to 99 please. Lv 50 cap doesn\'t feel right at all.',
       'This is a great game. I like how you don\'t use energy like most games. Some things you have a limited amount of times you can play the quests but the story has no limits on how much you can play. A fun game with an interesting story. The characters i.e. cloud and squall have similar personalities as they did in the previous games. Overall they did a great job with the game.',
       'Great for now. Unfortunately can see this being ruined by in app purchases in future. They can\'t make a free game and not get in app purchases revenue. But at the moment the pricing is way off. You can earn around six of the 5 star weapons in the first couple of days. But if you want to buy an extra one it costs about £70. No body is going to pay that it\'s silly money. If the were £5 each would buy a few in support of devs. But as it stands can\'t see how they will make any money. They will obviously need to change something. Just hope it doesn\'t ruin it.',
       'Well thats good. But is it really going be more good if theres a boss raids,guilds and something we can compete in other player. And please update it asap, and plss add more main characters like noctis,lightning,shantoto etc. And i hope that in the future update, we can use our fav. Enemy char. Like sephirot. Overall super good!' ,

      'When I first started playing this game I thought it was great. Big wins but the further you go the more impossible the challenges to beat and no where enough credits to beat them unless you buy and way to expensive to buy for the amount of credits you get. The daily bonus only comes 1 or 2 times a week, funny I thought there was only 24 hours in a day. It\'s fun until you get to the higher levels.',

       'It\'s a great game but I think you guys should open the classic Sonic event again and add classic eggman as his boss and maybe add more classic zones for classic Sonic (like Angel Island or something) plus make classic Sonics running style like his in generations his running style makes no sense... Classic isn\'t worth the 6 dollars the way it is...',
       'Omg that is the best game ever I love it like how u can revive and u can get different people than the same person keep up the good work guys maybe you will have the whole  world playing it soon I live ut😘😘😘',
       'What can I say? It\'s an infinite runner with a Sonic aesthetic and some mechanics from the game. Nothing particularly unpleasant, but nothing really special either.',

    description: '2DEGREES DATA HUNT 2degrees Data Hunt is back, its game on! There is 200 million megabytes of free data all over New Zealand, all you have to do is find it between 13/11/17 and 06/02/18 and it’s yours.  Using the interactive map as your guide, find 2degrees Data Pins throughout the country. When you’re in a Data Spot you’ll be able to collect data by spinning the Data Pin to find out how much free mobile data you’ve scored! All the data you collect will be loaded to your 2degrees mobile account. You could win up to 10GB – how much free data can you hunt down? Not a 2degrees mobile customer? Don’t worry you can still join the hunt, just sign up to 2degrees mobile before the 06/02/18 and any data you’ve found will be added to your account. Please note that only 2degrees Prepay, Pay Monthly, Business Choice and Business Connect customers are eligible to redeem the prize data. INTERACTIVE MAP AND DATA SPOTS The Data Hunt interactive map will guide you through the gaming experience. Make sure you have location services turned “on” then you can use the interactive map to locate the many Data Spots throughout New Zealand. When you’re in a Data Spot you’ll be able to ​switch to live view mode, this will allow you to spin and collect Data Pins. DATA PINS Every Data Spot has its own Data Pin, loaded with a range of free data values. When logged in you’ll be able to keep track of your Data Hunt progress, with live updates telling you how many Data Pins you’ve collected and their value. You can only collect data from a Data Pin once, but don’t panic, there are over 1,500 Data Pins to find and there’s up to 10,000MB to be won per 2degrees customer. GOLDEN PINS If you are a 2degrees customer, keep a look out for elusive Golden Pins. Golden Pins will pop up for a limited time every once in a while, track them down and give them a spin to score massive data amounts. It pays to get to these fast, because they don’t stick around for long. SNAP AND SHARE WITH YOUR FRIENDS Whenever you collect free data you’ll be able to show it off by snapping and sharing a pic with the Data Pin. We’ll be keeping an eye out and getting in touch with the people who post our favourites, so make sure we can see your post by tagging your photo with #2degreesdatahunt.If you think your friends will want to join the hunt, you can send them your unique invite code to score double data if they start playing.  Continued use of GPS running in the background can dramatically decrease battery life.

      'Was working great untill todays update error 15 cant find my location. 4th attemt it loaded. Used to be first attemt. Been a couple of weeks still taking half an hour to get app running. Same location problem. Samsung j. Still same problem but loads in about 15min under error screen. Does eventually work',
       'I have never used such a clumsy and slow app. The idea is great. The execution (23 Dec) is atrocious. This seems to be common regardless of phone or other apps running.  Definitely a poor advertisement for a network provider.  Love the data though.',
       'My family is starting to hate me. Whenever I stop to hunt some data they know it\'s going to take me at least half an hour with the numerous restart attempts to get the app going and the long wait every time it almost successfully loads. Your app is wasting their time and mine, don\'t know why I even bother anymore! Oh, the things we\'ll do to get a bit of free stuff, but no more, I\'ve had enough for now. Maybe I\'ll try again next time, if there is a next time, just to see if you\'ve sorted the app out.',
       'TRY THIS FIX... On install, I had same error 15 message, unable to find location, etc (I have a Xiaomi Redmi 3). Here\'s where I found buried permission setting not activated by default on my phone: Privacy/Location/Location Access/Permissions/Data Hunt - set "get location info" to "Accept". Also make sure location method set to "high accuracy". Hopefully this helps someone, app now seems to be working fine for me',
       'Since the update app takes even longer to open. It crashes constantly and sometimes just won\'t bring up a map at all. I don\'t understand why they needed to update something that worked fine and now simply doesn\'t,  as you can see from numerous reviews below.',
       'Very poorly coded app. Very slow at loading, however haven\'t had any issues as of yet, however it is day 1. The Google Maps app is less than half the size of this app and much more feature rich!' ,

       'HTC U11. Like the App for the most part. Would like to have option to drive on grand prix circuit. Most troubling issue is that after I spent $119.99 for 200,000 points I believed I would be able to purchase all vehicles and packs in this App and developer\'s other iterations of this same type of App. Turns out I wasn\'t able to purchase all vehicles in this App but couldn\'t use my points across developer\'s other racing App\'s. Now I\'m stuck with 185,000 points and pretty much out $100.00 does not make me happy at all. I would like this developer to contact me somehow as I don\'t have contact info. Thanks',

      'I really like (love) this game, but 7 energy per level (out of 20 total) means I play 2 levels and then close the game. Sorry Tapps, wish I could like MORE and play MORE but you literally aren\'t letting me. Make level energy 3*-5* and I will give a 5 star rating. Till then, I\'ll stare at this app and click around to others that actually give me play time.',
       'Crashes on post game adverts. Developers only allow you 2 games per session. 7 energy per game but a max of 20 = 2 games. On, so you don\'t want me to play. I won\'t. You\'ll make more cash allowing gamers to get addicted than hoping they\'ll buy after 2 games. THEN you have to pay gold to refuse an offer in your shop! In what world would that work? Finally, once the bidding gets past 2k the bids jump up a ridiculous amount meaning bargains are impossible. 1k jumps make profit impossible.',
       'It was really fun at first  but not so much anymore  after you unlock everything and upgrade your pawn shop fully it gets stale. Christmas theme was Very fun would like to see that kind of thing every month depending on holiday of the month like Valentines day themed for February and a Independence day theme for July could be Awesome',
       'This game is rigged. It starts you off really strong but after the first bit it\'s almost impossible to make money. My game will even skip letting me collect items and it\'ll only say I broke even but I never get my money back for that storage unit.',
       'You need more cities or rooms. I cleared all in a couple of weeks and now for over a month nothing new to play. Is coming soon ever going to happen.  Love the game but lets keep adding to it or I am gone along with many of my friends who love this game also.',
       'Regardless of what some people say, this isn\'t even close to being realistic!   I\'ve been waiting for 2 months for level 28 and I\'m getting pretty annoyed with it. If they don\'t add new ones soon, I\'m going to quit playing.' ,

      'I Would Give It Five Stars...but...you should make it customizable for the colors you want to cycle through as you stack higher. THIS GAME IS NOT COLOR BLIND FRIENDLY. Great Idea Though, Nice Hand Eye Coordination Exercise. (I see Black and White, so a monochrome setting would be nice. Other people see colors differently as well) Needs A Color Cycle Customizer, or a set of different options for each type of Color Blind. Thanks in advance',
       'A Great Game For When You\'re Dumpin\'. I decided to install it because I ran out of YouTube videos while droppin\' a duce. I really enjoy and will be using it the next time I\'m in here as well. The ads are there, but they aren\'t too bad and there is an option to remove them for a small fee as well (which I plan to do.) My time in the bathroom has flew by because of the game and I\'m happy to say that. I don\'t like to stay too long. Great game!',
       'So,  basically it\'s a pretty fun app to play when you\'re bored. It\'s a great time killer, and is very challenging, but at the same time easy! It\'s a perfect app! I remember I downloaded this, and then I uninstalled it because I needed other apps on my phone. And now I installed it again, so then I have a fun game to play. I don\'t really have any games on my phone, so this is the perfect one. The inventors are genius! Five stars!!',
       'Good, with a major flaw I\'ve ran into an issue that occurs about 1 out of every 3 rounds, where I\'ll tap, and the game won\'t register the trap until well after the position I wanted. For a game based on timing and your ability to stack moving blocks, when you tap is important, and needs to be 100% reliable. I\'m on a Nexus 6P, very new phone with excellent hardware. I\'ve closed all background apps, to try and troubleshoot. It\'s an issue I\'d like to see fixed.',
       'Some faults Overall a simple yet addictive game. Too many ads. The game ends and instantly an ad appears and your still hitting the screen so you automatically click an ad. I\'m sure advertisers don\'t want to pay for a click that was purely a mistake. Also the leader board has people on 5000 points. I can\'t get past 78 after a lot of playing so I can\'t see 5000 points is scored without a hack.',
       'A good game, love this company This game is very good. I have only been playing it for about a week, but I truly enjoy it. I have one problem though, and I don\'t know if it is just my phone or what since it is new still. I cannot purchase any new block textures and I would really love to see the jelly or money textures. Other than that it is fine.' ,
    recentChanges: 
      '◉ NEW: You can unlock new kinds of blocks (Art, Money $$$...). Unlock them all!',

      'I started this game when it first came out. There were hardly any game advantages and everyone was having fun and on the same playing field. As more and more packages got released into the game it became a pay to win situation. I personally do not think spending $100+ on a phone game is a wise investment. Thus I enjoyed the game by taking advantage of their events and the prizes within the game. However, it has become dominated by people who payed to be the big guy and the little people get absolutely demolished. It has taken the fun out of playing, which really dissapoints me as it was a fun game to play.',
       'This game has potential to be fun but it\'s completely ruined because IT\'S COMPLETELY PAY-TO-WIN which sucked the fun out of the game that I quit. Don\'t get me wrong, Final Fantasy is highly respected RPG franchise because it\'s full of great games in the series. But no this one.  However, I might come back if the game developers make it not as pay-to-win as it is now. Right now, it\'s a complete money bucket!',
       'This game is great and fun, I love spending my time playing this game. One problem though, what is going on with the packages? Why is it every time a package is bought all the packages go from 20 to 100 dollars ? We should be able to buy the 20 dollar packages more than once! Is that fixable? Please cuz i do want to keep playing but 100 dollars is too much.',
       'The game is very addictive and fun to play. Some of the people playing the game are wonderful and fun to game with. Graphics are very good for a on line game played on phone, tablet or computer. The quests are challenging at best. BUT!!! BE WARNED... This game is not for young children as there is explicit language and cut throat people playing the game. After all it is a war game and nothing more. Now down to the nitty-gritty of the game. Yes it\'s free, but that only get you so far before you will need to buy packs in the game to advance and unlock the two new characters. The game quests are designed for people to spend if you want to get ahead fast. Large amounts of  $$$$$$ Cash are needed to play this game. $$$$$$ Personal note, I know people who have spent thousands on this game. Over all the game is great for young adults on up. PG-15',
       'This game is great and will make you feel tho go all out. It challenges you in a healthy way and keeps you on your toes. Join a guild, trust me. You can do a lot by yourself but joining a guild in this game is actually fun. I haven\'t experienced anything toxic, yet. I\'ve been playing for about a week and it\'s really great',
       'All the advanced features (such as the mythic forge or oracle) cost $100 each just to unlock and even more to upgrade. Pay to win players are nearly impossible to beat. And the strong always prey on newer weaker players. Being successful in this game is more about the size of your wallet than your skill. It is easy to learn, the controls are simple and it does have good graphics. If you play passed level 20 it is key to guard your hero at all costs.' ,

      'Game is fun until you get so far and can no longer upgrade to compete.  I have all stars in amateur league, yet on achievement rewards it shows I only have 1 star.  This is a problem to try to earn stars to purchase higher end cars, you can\'t without spending money.  Should be anle to earn all cars if you play regularly withput spending money.',
       'Good time waster. Especially well made in the beginning levels, but quickly becomes pay to win, as diamonds are not easily attainable and neither are coins, not to mention that later cars are very high prices and require much dedication to acquire. Controls are nice, but like with money, get worse with time. Maps are not optimized for later leveled cars, making some corners physically impossible to make even when drifting at full tilt, forcing the player to adapt to a combination of drifting, boosting and then braking to get around a bend without crashing. Otherwise, it is a very nice game for being free, although there are many ads, but that\'s excusable as it is a free game. I would recommend it, just not as a long term type of game.',
       'Update: so I\'ve been playing for several weeks now. You cannot win with maxed out mods, racing the same level cars. They\'re twice as fast and you can only knock off 3 cars at the beginning of the race and you\'re unable to catch with others. Even if you spend money, you will not get 1st place in a lot of the races. Very unbalanced game. Whoever programmed the ai should be fired  Fun game, but the intrusive ads are ridiculous. It pops up in the middle of a race, before and after the race, finished off by asking you to pay to remove ads.',
       'Nice game at first, my gf got angry at some point because I played it the whole time. However, I soon started playing less and less, because winning just became impossible. I respect the developers, but I wont pay to max out a cars modifications just to race that same car which is twice as fast. How does that work? Are the AI cars getting modifications from a different game?',
       'The controls is very floaty like your car is late responding when tilted and i really like that this game is very fun and time wasting but it lacks car selection very small but i know it will add soon. And i thought the pic is real but it is not even the same on the game for its originality that all thanks',
       'So many ad\'s, there back to back ad\'s. When I am finally able to select a race, guess what...another ad pops up and takes me to the play store to download it. I go back to the game and I gotta start all over again from the first screen. Ad\'s ad\'s ad\'s I was only able to play on the first day I downloaded it, after that..... Ad\'s ad\'s ad\'s                    "AD\'S!!!".... But i did like the game when I played it' ,

      'I like this game. I purchased it because it deserves, also I want to remove ads. 3,50 € and ads are not removed completely. I\'m disappointed, expecially for the "restore purchase" button that not works. Despite this I think that as a game is fun but monotonous in the long run, defect of 90% of apps of this kind. I hope developers will add something with updates that are not other challenges that ofter go to luck (and waiting time should e removed also). Sometimes there are some bugs but irrilevant for gameplay. The development house has made other interesting apps too. Sorry for errors, is not my first language.',

       'Is there a way to get rid of ads? I\'d even pay a couple dollars to rid of them. I\'d give this app a 5 if it had a way to get rid of all the ads. They are very annoying and you don\'t enjoy the game that much then.',

      'What Fun! I want to go to Vegas, circumstances won\'t allow rite now. I get to play slots at Cesar\'s Palace everyday now! Getting familiar counting big amounts. Expect it to come in handy when I become a hotshot high roller in Las Vegas. Graphics are up and above super. Play Elvis with real scenes/tunes of Elvis. I\'m walkin\' down the isles now with a beautiful lady luck in each arm. Eat your heart out Hugh Hefner',
       'I had Caesar\'s slots a few years ago didn\'t like it, I downloaded it for my mate on his new tablet seeing the diffence made me get it again. Haven\'t had it since 2014 since having this app back it\'s the 1/12 slot apps I play Daily. I feel a slots machine games or any game should give the player incentive to keep playing with out paying $. On a another note it seemed like there was a pattern, The bet rates are more frequent and easy to follow but as real slots are it could change at any second. 👏👏👏👏',
       'Well came back but nothing has CHANGED.  Started with 8million, great then once again only got 6 money credits once  no feature at all and now credits nearly gone again. I sometimes why do you ask to RATE cos you never take much notice really. Bye once more will not bother anymore. SAD REALLY.',
       'I\'ve played slot apps before. This game is only slightly better, provided you are playing it on a computer via Facebook. For the last 6 minutes, the phone app version has been refusing to let me play any of the slots, saying that the "assets" are still downloading. No slot app should take this long to download assets on the main menu, when it should\'ve done this on the loading screen.',
       'Took the new pink panther machines out! Only had 1 more spot to go to get the mega bonus.  The day before it said they were under 🚧.  Give me a break 4 real this is a true pos app',
       'I used to love this game but have not been able to play on my phone now for two weeks.  I contacted customer support and was told to wait for game update.  A week later and many updates later I contacted them again and got the exact same "form e-mail" response.' ,

      'Amazing game, great time-killer. I discovered a game breaker: if you go into the settings after you die, the number of coins you got in that level, the number in the brackets becomes equal to the total number of coins. Keep going back and forth into the settings, and the game will eventually ask if you want to triple the coins by watching a video. Instead of tripling the number of coins you got in that level, the number of total coins you have gets tripled.  Instantly triple your wallet every run.  I want the devs to see this and see if they can patch it because I really like this game and I want the coins I earn to be legit.  Thanks for your time, Mike C.',
       'It has a progression system, but it\'s completely worthless. The only reason to try to win belts is to get weapons that serve no purpose. You can win most of them by paying 200 coins and getting a random one, but you can, for some odd reason, get duplicates. Not to mention the fact that coin combos actually do nothing, not even useless cosmetic items, nothing. I think adding function to the weapons (e.g. Making long swords slightly longer range or making small weapons quicker) could add more depth and more of a reason to play the game. Overall: It\'s a good timekiller.',
       'Great game. Best for killing time. Great concept. Need to add a  counter for counting the number of people killed, otherwise awesome. Also there is not much incentive to play to win belts. Make playing with boss again free. Add new opponents (not bosses but the minions) . Make the game a little less challenging. Also remove the brief stun completely',
       'Really fun game. Nice graphics and simple controls. More depth to combat system would be nice. There is no point in achieving coin combos. It does not affect the amount of coins won. Add a multiplier for coin combos, as well as a score multiplier for chaining combos together without missing enemies or coins. Don\'t allow duplicate items to be won. Very annoying to grind and grind for coins, only to get a duplicate you can\'t do anything with. Lastly, an option to pay to disable ads would be nice.',
       'First of all its a simple game all u have to do is tap left or right to kill people closing in on u.. No proper tutorial or hints on how to win each stage, weapons are awesome but u\'ll start to feel bored after sometime.. No way to skip the story line, worst game... But can definitely be improved if included more buttons n skills other than this left or right tap',
       'The game mechanics are exactly the same as many games out there ... so what\'s different ? There\'s a progression system, problem with that is there is no incentive to progress. Purple belt requirements include a certain amount of twohanded sword kills. Everyday for the last 2 weeks I\'ve purchased items, not 1 is what I need ... broken' ,

      'On level 19 I scored three stars bit it shows only two. Aside from that, no other complaints... YET. I will say thank you, though, for not aggressively pushing ads, pushing to pay to extend the aim line. So far, its amusing😁',
       'This is a really fun game but my  my concerns are that when I have no balls left, for me it doesn\'t have the option to play a video to earn more but for my brother it does therefore it makes me start all over again. The other concern is that when I use a bomb for the chest it takes away a ball for example I have 12 balls when I use the bomb from the chest, I get 11 balls left which it doesn\'t do that for my brother. I hope you can fix this.',
       'It\'s the best! But there are a bit too many ads, but the thing I like about the ads that they are shorter than most ads.',
       'So far it\'s great. Could use some improvements in the video and audio effects to differentiate the amount of bubbles you bring down, otherwise, great.',
       'Good game but I don\'t like the mini game of having to find the moving close button twice before each round.... oh wait those are ads !!',

      'Looked up plagiarism in the dictionary and it led me to this game. This guy clearly saw the success of Devolver Digital and REIGNS and figured he could make a quick buck. Don\'t fall for this guy\'s scam, reward creators who put effort into creating an original product, unlike this hack',
       'This game is so simple but also addictive. All you have to do is keep swiping like you do on tinder;) It\'s not an easy game and the story line is great! I\'ve just finish 1/3 of the story~ absolutely gonna end all of them',
       'Nice minimalist design. The choices are meaningful... but I can\'t wrap my head around why some choices decrease and increase certain resources. Some seem incorrect. I also think Oracle prices are way, way too high. Other than that, I\'m thoroughly enjoying the game.',
       'Nice to spend sometime thinking how to manage things based on logic desicions. It could have more case scenarios, more weird ones. Don\'t be afraid to put some creative things that sometimes will be hard to happen in the real world.',
       'Some choices are complicated and you have to die for the duration of the game. Thats the concept actually you are in a limbo of some kind and you need to die in order to go on forward kind of thing. I would give a solid 7/10 minimum.',
       'This game has a great idea and a even better way of showing it beliefs. I love the fact that the game breaks the 4th wall over time and the many secrets and ways the game can end which always wants me to continue playing' ,

Good job square enix hope you guys do more a game like this on phone. Not all player hv time to play at home.',
       'waited a long time for this release and my 2 month old premium android device is not supported. Why can I play any other game in the app store except this one? Come on square, please make your resolution adaptable or whatever the issue is like you did with all your other games',
       'Genuinely a solid Final Fantasy Experience for mobile. Don\'t think this as a cheaped out on, cut down version of FFXV on the console! The Voice Acting and story remain perfectly recreated and the combat is genuinely (for me anyway) way more fun than in the console version itself. Love everything about this game, well done to Square Enix and the FF team!',
       'I\'m late to the world of Final Fantasy, I\'ve always know about it but I am not a fan of turn based action. Then Finial Fantasy XV comes out for XBOX ONE X and I still ignore it. I noticed that it came out for mobile and as I just purchased a Razer Phone I decided to give it a try and I loved it. Then I just finished watching Kingsglave on Netflix and I\'m hooked. So because of a Android game I have now watched a movie and pre ordered the Windows edition to through my top spec gaming rig at it in all its glory. Love it.',
       'Oh WOW Square Enix you have nailed this. It is so easy to play, so fun and the gameplay is just perfect for mobile. Those who are complaining just need faster phones. 10 minutes into this game and all I can say is this is amazing!! It is definately a much better launch than ff15 on ps4. 10/10!  PS. Game is now stuck on loading screen when I try to load game. Needs to be fixed!',
       'Love what you have done with this game, the gameplay is incredible and it feels just like the ps4 version. After waiting so long for this to come out, it is better than I could have imagined. The the only thing that i would change would be to add the option to chose to use a joy stick. I don\'t mind using touch for everything else, but would love to at least have the option to use a joy stick for moving around. Other than that though, very impressed with the game.' ,

      'I really enjoy the action this game brings along with good looks and simple controls.

Thank you for making this game a joy to play every time I turn it on.',

       'My issue... and i dont think im the only one whos mentioned this one. Its the pvp. Freezes like anything and is unplayable. My other issue is during campaign that sometimes you cant even attack the opposition because they\'re not there. Only their life bar is so you run out of time. Because of that you waste stamina and its completely unfair.',

      'I think that we should get more  coins for winning the levels. I find that the game can cost me money that I don\'t have, so I will spend less time playing your game. I love this game alot but why play if you are not getting enjoyment because it costs to much to play. (Otherwise I love the game) I also never got my horse, please give me my horse, I really need that horse btw. I already had a name for her to. I was going to call her daisy. The name goes great with the garden theme. (If you hadnt realized thst already) Please please send me daisy, I love her already. Peace.',
       'It was a lot of fun the first few "days" but got very hard very fast. Don\'t bother with power-ups as it doesn\'t really make a difference. The only way to win is to get lucky with a big bomb. That\'s it. It\'s a shame because the game is nice, I just progress way too slowly now for it to be worth playing.',
       'I enjoy playing this game but I think 900 coins is crazy for 5 extra lives. There are other games I play that offer less coins and a boost for a smaller price. On one game I play it\'s 65 coins for 10 extra moves and a boost, on a different one it\'s 25 coins for 5 extra moves. I also think that stars for each level should vary too. For harder levels it should be 3 stars, for medium levels it should be 2 stars, and for easy levels 1 star. I\'ll continue to play no matter what, it\'s fun, challenging and strategical!',
       'The first thing that comes to mind is that you guys have gone above and beyond on this one!! It\'s so much fun!! From the interactions of restoring the grounds, to decorating them (custom, might I add !!)    To the actual sounds the game makes while playing.. I can\'t stay off of it. And yes I\'m constantly tempted to purchase coins when I can\'t beat a level, for like the 7th time!!  Haha 😂 Great game guys!! We would ALL appreciate more gifts than currently available. Especially for your daily addicts, 😁 Forever a gamer.     Xx',
       'I rly enjoy this game the only 2 dwn falls it has.. is it only let\'s u spin the wheel every other day and when you get a free life.. it won\'t let you use it. It says ur lives are full. so you never get it also i wish it gave u more than 5 lives im on level 244',
       'Loving it.  Reached level 370, and am really enjoying the game. Fun, good graphics, good story. Nice balance of challenging levels and easier ones, but so far no levels that look impossible. On the negative side, 900 hard won coins for 5 extra moves is ridiculous. When replaying a level it would be nice if you could go straight to the game play without the screen telling you what you need, we already know.' ,

      'Just downloaded this less than an hour ago.I think its a great game to relax to. It\'s also reat for passing time if you\'re bored, or playing while waiting for something. So far I think it\'s a pretty good game. I haven\'t ran into many ads so far but we\'ll see the longer i play. But so far it\'s pretty fun',
       'This is a wonderful word game and it helps with spelling if you are not that great it.  One of the best I\'ve tried to date.  4/12/17 - Just an update to my previous review.   I still love this game!  I actually went all the way to the end, finishing the app and feeling really down that it was done.  I waited a week and down loaded again and I\'ve started all over.  I am SOOOOO addicted.  2/8/18 - Just still love this game!  You can now choose your own theme in the settings.  Game helps me to relax before going to sleep!',
       'Should be able to pass on every game so ur not locked into finishing any game. Often the swipe part malfunctions. Should be able to hv unlimited hints w/o having to earn points to get them. Where\'s the dog? I\'m uninstalling bec the dog and jar isn\'t there.',
       'It works really great on my phone and I would recommend it. There are ads but you could ignore them. It is fun to use and there are videos to watch to get more coins if you don\'t have enough. Etc.',
       'Fun way to pass time. I have only been playing a couple days, so I\'m not sure how challenging it will end up being. Right now its very easy,but still fun. Would recommend.',
       'Love playing the game . been freezing up on me with this new Valentine app on it though. Had too reload on my tablet because it just wasn\'t working right. Now it didnt save any that I\'ve completed. I was pretty far into with evening spending alot for coins for hints too. Can you see what went wrong please my leve on my iphone was at the papaya level on one area of that.. Pls let me know. This makes me mad too.. Do enjoy this one..' ,

      'Great game. You should definitely earn at least 10 coins when you solve a puzzle instead of 2 though! I know you can watch an ad but even that isn\'t enough I don\'t think.The game seems Americanised (I\'m British)  and  I didn\'t recognise some of the words (webmail?). Very fun though!',
       'After the puzzle is won, a page pops up telling you what the word is. Obviously we know the word or we wouldn\'t be moving on. That extra page is pointless. And the cost of coins for help is a little much since each puzzle is only worth 2 coins. I think bringing down the cost of the help choices or making the puzzle worth more than 2 coins would be better. But a fun game tho.',
       'This game gave me PTSD and I accidentally murdered my wife after she woke me up from a night terror. Overall its a good time waster while I await sentencing.',
       'I love it! Sure, the controls don\'t work good but it is very challenging to the brain! Me and my grandmal plays it! You need to get it right away! Because if you don\'t you will be missing out on a lot of things!',
       '30 second LOUD ADS pop up willy-nilly. The only way to silence them is ditch the phone in a padded pocket, or restart the phone. I opted for 2, then uninstalled.',
       'I did a picture with lips and a hard drive well guess what.        That word hardrive ment stick your pictures are not accurate at all please fix this.   This is a horrible game and it takes you points away NO WAY' ,

      'Great game, Love it! Very creative, fantastic graphics. Not so difficult or loss of life\'s to where you can\'t even play.  Yet still challenging.  Only negative is lots of ads. Would gladly pay nominal fee to get rid of them.',
       'I really like this game but newer version I have updated to after 3 months and I see the Hooray Sound in the end and some more sounds in between has been changed to Ticking kind of sound.   I seriously and kindly request to the developer to restore those sounds which were there in old versions because I seriously loved it. I wish those sounds can come back which makes the game more amazing.   And ofcourse I still continue to play this and have hope for those sounds to be back.',
       'A truly fun, interesting & free game. A good game for any age. If you need to do something relaxing, this is a good way. You\'ll get hooked!!! I\'m in the 500\'s & it\'s still fun! The ads only require 1 more touch on the screen than you have been doing. Well worth it.',
       'Game is fine, ads are fine and can be avoided by not opening chests (not really needed to beat the levels) I\'m really hoping they increase in difficulty though, on level 50+ and that all seem to be fairly easy.',
       'Why played stressing games? I highly recommend this games for more relaxing & fun for resting your stress mind. Maybe developer can reduce the advert? It\'s kind a "too often".',
       'I\'m convinced the sole purpose of this game is to show you ads. After 40 levels, I find it almost impossible to lose. Keep playing if you love ads, and love to win.' ,

      '**UPDATE** Was an awesome game. Could use a few more perks (ie. Weapons and hard to get items) in drop boxes and yellow zones.Now the down side is if you die in a level your last position is no longer there to try and recoup some of your items. Players killing you as you open trunks in inventory screen. With that I think I am done with this game. Oh ya and the free spin box...give random prizes instead of coins and rope. People will get really into it if perks are awesome.',
       'Honestly ive been waiting for close to 2 months. This game was like crack for me until the update left me no nice place, no hard earned stuff. I dont mind starting from the bottom again but at least give me some perks. This game is worth every cent and time. But until i get my account back or my stuff back im leaving 2 stars when really this game should be 5 stars all the time. I wont be playing this game til then. Thanks for the good times.',
       'I love the game. It\'s awesome. But I do have a few questions. Why are the bunker cards so extremely difficult to find? I\'ve been looking for days killing every zombie possible and looking through every crate without finding the cards. Also. Why isn\'t there a disclaimer that says if you die in the game, everything you purchased will be lost? I think that would be extremely necessary so no one over spends their money. Other than that, absolutely smooth running, fantastic graphics, and realistic deaths. I love every aspect except I can\'t find these darn bunker key cards.',
       'Great, addictive game! However, real fast, I was wondering how the free box worked. I always hope for something real good but ALWAYS end up with either raw materials or ONE coin. Now don\'t get me wrong, I LOVE getting free stuff, it just seems like the "spinner" purposefully chooses raw materials. Like, it\'s not random like it seems; it never chooses anything close to a weapon! In any case, I cannot play this game enough, very very fun!',
       'Absolute love the game and would\'ve gave a better review but version 1.7.6 and 1.7.7 won\'t work. It keeps saying "connection lost... It seems you lost connection to one of our game servers. Restart the game to proceed" over and over again ever since the 1.7.6 game update. If they fix it I will be updating my review to 5 stars because it is one of my favorite games',
       'FINALLY , I was able to complete my chopper. All the updates are very awesome. Well done Kefir! Just want to REPORT A BUG OR SOMETHING - when I went to a rest stop after the latest update. I can\'t seem to transfer the items from my chopper back to my inventory and to my surprise it all disappeared (bottles full of gasoline, 1 red ticket, 1 glock and a rifle) please fix this. Too bad i got 29 red tickets at the bunker. hahah but thats okay. Hope there will be some kind of reward to those non paying players. been with LDOE for 6months now.  THANKS!' ,

      'They have fine a great job with this game. The dynamics, the playability, the graphics, and it feels as if you could never stop growing. Every bot is beast with a certain load out and play style.  Update! After playing for over 3 years, and over many different platforms this game rocks. It\'s definitely not the mech its the pilot kinda game. The balance is good so if you spend money and level quickly you\'ll be placed on your mechs rating(mech level + weapon level) so take your time and learn some tactics. Every gun has its purpose but it takes a good pilot to make them work.',
       'Game is designed to milk money out of its players. Fun to play. But $200 for a pretend robot or $100 for a single gun. Lower prices. You might be shocked more people can afford 20 than 200......reply- you think giving someone 15 pieces of a random bot that takes 2 games to earn if you place first out of the 10000 you need. Only real option they give is purchas. Don\'t be fooled. This is a pay to win game.',
       'I like how the game has gotten better over past year in many ways.. But could you guys quit making the puzzle peice stuff to get newest goodies? I get you added lots of cool ways to get extras that\'s cool and all.. But who wants 7 puzzle pieces out of 7,000? Not worth the effort. Keep it gold and silver guys!!',
       'I totally like the game and all but there must be balance between different robots especially..... some robots have a big advantage like the haechi with 3 medium slots and its dash ability.. its like u cant even aim at it......  Also please remove the components so that everyone is able to buy newer robots... u can make them available in gold or silver or even workshop points',
       'Huge pay to win. Takes patience with a DNA lab which is a nice feature. Save up enough and you can use that purchase some good robots. Very fun game, expect a lot of losses to better bots and weapons unless you want to spend like 60$ per robot and weapon. Only downfall.',
       'This game was great until about 5 days ago, that is when it started to take 4 to 5 minutes loading time for each game mode to start. Now my attention span prevents me from waiting that long to play one game. What happened game developers?.... !!UPDATE!! Okay it must have just been the servers. Because they\'re back up and running at 32 seconds loading time for a war. This game is great. I can dig it can you dig it' ,

      'It\'s nice game - very nice graphic, very smooth moving - it would be 5 stars. BUT - I payed for levels 13 and 14 , and the game does not allow me to play in random order - it\'s not possible to play no. 23 without finishing all numbers before. If you are stuck in some number, you cannot go to another one - you MUST BUY hint!!! It means - you PAID for the game, but you MUST PAY again for hint - or you are blocked in PAID  game. It\'s just not fair.',
       'I loved flow free from a young age. I\'ve played until 9×9 pack but when I reached a certain level,  the game stopped working after that and I\'ve tried over and over again to go in but the game just keeps bring me back to the home screen and keeps stopping. Please fix it. I really want to play the remaining levels and packs',
       'Great game. Keep coming back to it. I find it relaxing solving the puzzles, though it has become super easy! All versions are great. All in all, awesome job! One of my favourites, and works in any situation. Quick break at work, something productive ? Play. Something to do before sleep? Play. Got a few extra mins? Play! Wanna challenge yourself on timed? Play! Haha.',
       'Was a great game until about 48 hours ago. I didn\'t mind the ads but now after every level I complete there\'s a video ad. Even then I would deal with it but it closes my music player. So after the ad I have to go to the music player and start it again but then when I switch back to the game I have to relaunch and reselect the level. Gets annoying to have to do after every level',
       'Fantastic game. Real addiction game I\'d say. It\'s an awesome time killer. Different types of levels never make the game boring. Graphics is okay. Number of ads for a free to play game is less compared to other games out in the market which is a relief.Overall I would give 4.5/5',
       'Love this app! I prefer the original version over the walls, hex, etc. and have solved every single one of them. Need more puzzles. Although I\'m sure I can solve them all again as it\'s impossible to remember these. Either way, I cannot get enough of them.' ,

      'Hey RobTop, the game is ok, but there is one issue. im used to playing geometry dash with my samsung chromebook 3 (it doesn\'t have touchscreen) and when i press the spacebar on my computer (this is the same issue on geometry dash lite and subzero) it doesn\'t let me jump. And can you let geometry dash world players create and play user created levels. Fix and add this and I will give you 5 stars. Gameplay and graphics are nice.',
       'Got all the way to the end,  and an as popped up accidentally clicked on it cuz it was being slow,  and ended up having to restart all of the levels,  fix this,  it doesn\'t happen with the other geometry dash games,  just this one every time I exit my data gets deleted...  Fix then 5 stars',
       'When I heard that this was out, I rushed to the Play Store, freed up my storage and installed this app. This is fantastic, as I had been craving for 2.1. I finally have a little sneak peek, although…                                           A) No Spider in main levels (Challenge excused) B) Ads…ugh                                                        C) No Account Loading (2.1 fixed)                                      D) Levels too easy and short                               It’s still great!',
       'This is really hard. I can\'t buy the full game as I am only 9, but I think I am missing out on a lot. Please add check points to normal mode as some levels are basically impossible',
       'This game stress me out but the next day when I play it I beat the lv in one go and fills my heart up with joy! So what if the control\'s are sensitive? I know they are.. but if you take a day and give it another go you know what happens and you do great!',
       'I love this game just...can you fix one glitch? On the final level final area the wave is bugged ...when I tap it goes down by itself! Can you please fix it? I was trying over 3 hours to make it but I can\' t because of the glitch :( Please fix it.' ,

      'Good game however, once you\'ve taken control of all the islands there is little else to keep you interested. I would look at adding more world\'s and making the trading a real economy by having the ability to buy items and sell them for a profit in different ports. Potentially even have your ports taken over again or mutiny so you need to recapture them.',
       'Overall the game is great. Gameplay is smooth but slow (hey, old ships), making the gameplay calming. Graphics are pleasing to the eyes, though it could still need improvements. Sounds are calming too.   You guys should change the image for the gold coins since it resembles a symbol in One Piece. And also the whale movement could be smoother and slower. You could add more creatures in the ocean in addition to the whale since its just blank at times.',
       'Very simple. Gives me a lot of nostalgia. Two things though, it seriously needs music maybe some Celtic tunes or shanties. And secondly it needs more stuff to do. When I first saw a whale I was excited about doing some whaling but nope. The whales do absolutely nothing. Maybe even some treasure hunting puzzles or something. Good game just needs a little more content.',
       'Awesome game! Two things: please do something about the controls, they feel very poor quality. Even addig a left and a right arrow would be more comfortable for me.. Second is content. This game is huuuuge. But I\'m so addicted I managed to conquer all the islands by now, so I really want more challenges. Thanks for the awesome game, keep up the good work!',
       'Amazing game, graphics, and animations. My one wish is for an actual circle pad for movement because I have quite large fingers and I can\'t see what I\'m doing/ what\'s going on. Also would like maybe different routes to go on with boats: better damage but lower turning, faster but less health etc...',
       'This game together with Clash Of Clans are the best games I have ever played. It\'s addictive and fun but there\'s a lack of content. I completed the game and I don\'t know what to do now. I would really love it have my progress saved in the cloud and have more content added to the game. This game has perennial!' ,

      'Between ads completely over running gameplay and the new requirement of having to earn stars to proceed, Rovio continues to run this once great game into the ground. **Update** game now freezes randomly requiring a force close. This is beyond ridiculous. I HATE what this franchise has become. Rovio should be ashamed.',

      'This game was worth 5 stars until the updates... More than half the time i try to connect to a race its doesn\'t work and doesn\'t give me back the 20 energy it requires to race. Also, I watched 50 videos to get the new car BLADE and i received absolutely NOTHING!!!! Until they fix this issue its getting a 1 star from me.',
       'So first of all way too many ads... When you click race you get Frozen and then sent to home screen and you lose your fuel... When you\'re "waiting on players" and they don\'t show up you lose fuel.. out of 10 attempts to start a race I play one',
       'I reinstalled the game because the game has no sound what so ever, and now it has put me down to level 3 and I lost all my progression. Hours just down the drain. And to top it off, there still is no sound.',
       'The lunar deal lets you watch 50 videos to get a new car. I watched 50 and it didnt do anything it went back to 50!!! Dumb adds!',
       'Lots of adds, which is fine. But it freezes all the time and I don\'t get my gas back. Sometimes not enough people to fill a race. But other then that great game',
       'The new car, blade will glitch through the map and doesnt have a driver animation when you buy it.  Waste of time if you watch all the ads and waste of money if you just buy it' ,

       'YAY! FINALLY A GAME LIKE MINECRAFT!!!!!!! Except it doesn\'t have stuff like the animals, buckets, iron doors eg. But what is the Nether react core? It is just a made up block. But please add stuff like levers, iron doors, animals, Redstone, Buttons, iron trapdoors, texture packs, adventure mode,  Redstone torch\'s, Hoppers, Ripeters, dimensions like the Nether and The End, And other stuff from the game, "Minecraft". Also, add skin packs and make it like people can see there hand, and add mobs like dogs, cats, birds, rabbits, and foxes. Dogs, Man\'s best friend. Cats, Always cute. Birds, Watch them well you build. Rabbits, See them jump. Foxes. See one on an adventure. Please Also pay for Minecraft if you want it for stuff like Creepers. Also, add farm animals like chickens, sheep, cows, And other stuff like that. But plz do it. Also, add all paintings, pictures from Minecraft, and caves. I will Enjoy the game more if you do. Bye!',
       'Love the game! My only problem is that for some reason, when I grow wheat and try to get a cow to follow me, well they just ignore me. I haven\'t been able to find carrots for the pigs either. Frankly, I would like to be able breed animals pure and simple. Otherwise good job',
       'I really like this game. I\'ve never played Minecraft and since it cost money to download the app, this is something fun for me to play and not need to spend money. The only issue I have is in survival mode there doesn\'t seem to be enough cows, and I have only managed to make some shoe armor. But then again, there\'s a lot I haven\'t figured out yet, but it\'s been fun learning.',
       'It is a nice game but it is just shot of (some) things.. e.g animals, red stone ,pail (can contain milk ,water and lava or it can be empty) , red stone torch, paintings (diffirent sizes),mobs. Also, it would be nice if you can label the items that we picked so that it would be easier for us to pick the item that we want. I hope you can add some more items into the game.it will be more thrilling to play. Thanks' ,

      'Graphics were generic until now for x86 devices. Thanks for that update. And that moving data to sd card, it is really appreciable since now a days even 32 gb  not sufficient. Hope other game developers get inspiration from this. And downloading just updated part is also an improvement instead of downloading whole data again. 4 stars because this game just wont allow to play older version once it finds out new version is present.',
       'Best driving and racing game on the net. There is so much you can do, it not just " drive a car on a track and try to win", in this game you can choose your path on the track, perform unbelievable stunts and trick\'s, take out other players and cars.  The game play is absolutely great and the graphics are f***#&@ awesome, the only step to fallow in the graphics is realistic and their close to that now, love the game, the only thing I would change is I would make it easier to get car\'s, now the bikes and car packs instead of having to work really hard to get them or spend a lot of real money, granted the real money goes to development of the graphics and game, I would like to be able to get the car and bike packs a little bit easier. Definitely a winner, 🤩',
       'Asphalt 8 airborne is a very exciting game to play. The addition of bikes is mind blowing. Wish all time limited events could be on mobile data rather than wifi. Thumbs up gameloft for an exciting game. After the recent update of this app it keeps crashing with a pop-up message "unfortunately asphalt 8 has stopped working". Please fix this issue.',
       'Munich update completely ruined what was previously the best driving experience on mobile. EDIT: Fall Out Boy update basically makes me unable to play the game altogether, with the game constantly freezing at the Gameloft splash screen. Talk about letting the junior devs do all the work unsupervised...',
       'They fixed commercial black screen bug. Now i can play normal again. Wish longer time for events and R&D, because of work i dont have enough time to play. Money rewards sucks. You cant buy cheapest part from one 24h event. If you spend real money, you are way above evryone else. Also, slow cars are useless. There must be better way for multiplayer ranking.',
       'As racing games go, this is probably the best. The graphics, sound, gameplay are excellent. Race solo, against friends or the world. The variety of ways to race is big. The selection of cars and now bikes, keeps getting bigger. The only down side is buying something from the shop or on offer. I purchased a special offer and never got it. They got my money, I never got the goods. Trying to get in contact with them is a joke. All replies to my emails were automated responses telling me to do the same thing over and over again.' ,

      'The forced ads are louder than the audio on my phone .. before you reply and tell me ads are how you make money, I want to say I understand that, but do you review the ads before allowing them to be shown in the app? Some of these ads are sexual and offensive.... "Get ready to plow all night" is what one ad says... I\'m disgusted. I\'m done with all mobility ware apps!',
       'Used to love the game. But the adds kept getting worse and worse. Just did the update. And a sound add played in the background, and locked me from all functions, volume controls and home button. No better than viruses IMHO.',
       'The game is good, but it would be better without the ads. The biggest bummer is that phone gets rather hot. Walk outside bare feet on a mid-summer\'s day about 1/2 to 1 hour before peak-heat. That\'s about how hot.',
       'You have broken ads that need to be fixed. The game needs to be closed and reopened to clear the ad and deal a new hand. It\'s been this way for about a week.  ..edit.. Still have this issue. Am I the only one?',
       'Simple and easy. Just what solitaire is meant to be. No fancy bells and whistles. Just a relaxing simple game of solitaire like it should be. I\'ve seen people complain about the ads. What ads? I mean ONE 10 to 15 second ad before each game. I can easily live with that.',
       'This challenge of champions has been a spiritual awakening in my life. I\'ve never experienced such a euphoric rush of emotion while using a mobile device. I\'ve quit my career, divorced my life partner, and abandon my children. I\'ve been called to a greater purpose... Solitaire by MobilityWare! Thank you dear app Gods for bestowing such beauty upon us all.' ,

      'So far so good, much type of game we can played. Very kind developer give a good item free. I liked it. More costum appereances will be good (dont made weird costums). The minus is city is to small for lot of player like that. Very crowd, i cant even see other player appereances. So camera angle maybe you can make lil bit wider or higher so city can looked much bigger',
       'I cant log in to my acc. Even my friend couldnt too! Once i could and i exit the game to check on something, When i return, it doesnt do the normal reload thing. It brought me back to the main menu n tht i hav to log in again BUT i cant log in. I even uninstalled and installed it back a couple of times. It feels like im just taking chances here to be able to play. This all started in the afternoon for me. Not sure bout the rest. But please take some action about this matter and/or respond to us regarding this matter, Thru facebook or here. I really like the game. Soo please. Help. Explain whats happening. Get it fixed quickly.',
       'The support work really slow. I have top up twice and they aren\'t sent yet to my account. Have report 2 days ago but no reply yet. I only can report the first transaction because the app is not allowed me to report again before the first one is solved. I topped up for event but the event will  end today. If this is solved after goddess kiss event, I just want my money back. I wont delete this until the problem is solved fairly.',
       'Hi. I hope someone can help me. I cannot access my account in Server 141 my Character name: Penguin. Im sure about my email as this is my only email i am using on all of my accounts here at GPC. I just got logged out accidentally and when i logged back in i cannot find all my characters in both servers 131 (scru.iProOo and 141 (Penguin). Please assist. Asap. Godbless.',
       'Had so much fun and thrill in playing the game. Graphics and overall performance is great!! Though i would just like to be helped with my old account.PLEASE HELP ME RETRIEVE MY OLD ACCOUNT :( I want to continue my old progress but since ive changed phone, Id have to redownload and log in in the game. Tho unfortunately you guys updated it from the last time I played it and now, When i log in using my supposed account it kept me getting right from the start in choosing character. How can i get my old character back? Thats so unfair :( I made all effort :( My username is PetLucifer. Also, does server has to do anything in relation to that? Cause i cant remember which server i used to log in',

      'It\'s a great game in terms of versatility (as versatile a single game can be) and you can almost always play as there is a table for any amount in the start-up kitty. Like most Android poker games it gives you the option for daily free chips so you can play daily should you wish. Where it falls short is table talk and conversations are extremely limited. I mostly play in bed, at night, until sleepy so table talk isn\'t really for me most of the time but if you are wanting a social chit-chat game this isn\'t it.',
       'Look at your ledger board.. Typically the 1st names are Fake profiles, so you can\'t advance without buying chips to beat unreasonable winnings.. They all have similar stats.. no best winning hand.. no pic.. some have same name or real similar..It\'s obvious they are fake and Zynga has confirmed this, yet hasn\'t removed them.. They continue to allow it every week..',
       'Good game, but it has a major bug that a lot of people face daily, most of my poker buddies get the same issue. Joining a table will leave us on the loading screen and it gets stuck there. Back button does nothing, and you have to force exit the game. Sit and go tournaments do work every time, which is odd. I\'ve invested over 50 euros in this game, but with a game breaking bug like this, I\'m considering uninstalling it.',
       'I have to bring you down to 4 Stars bcos I think you manipulate my play. Imagine within 1 day I lost 400 million chips. Every hand I lost weirdly. Examples, I had a pair of Aces but lost to 2 pairs, I had a straight but lost to flush, I had flush but lost to house and the list goes on. Don\'t tell me that was coincidences or no luck and not my day. Then your announcements kept popping out telling me it is time to purchase chips and continue to play like a real HiRoller. This is really sickening to realise that I had been taken for a ride. Sorry I won\'t buy chips after this scam. When Iost the balance 47 millions chips I will say "Hasta La Vista" to you!',
       'What the hell zynga? I won around 20m, went back to lobby and suprise. 7m dissapeared in the dust. How can you take so much from a win? This game is so unfair and I\'m sure it\'s rigged. In real life you\'ll never see dozens of flushes and straights and a few 4 of a kinds in a day. Every day. And bots, hackers or whatever they are make it impossible to get to top xx in leagues so there\'s no way to advance unless you have a lot of chips and win a lot. I recommend you to not purchase anything because this game is broken.',
       'I think there\'s something wrong with this game, because since last night, it\'s so hard to join a room. Now, I can\'t join any room. I have no problem in entering the lobby, but I can\'t join any room because it\'s always loading. And fyi, there\'s no problem with my connection.' ,

      'This game is really good and fun but strate after you lose all 3 of your lives it goes straight onto an add. There are loads of adds and I don\'t think it needs that much adds for a game like dumb ways to die, on the other hand it\'s a grate game and it\'s a laugh and a joke, I think it\'s a really good game☺',
       'I love it and all that but it should really make some more valentine mini games because it just gets boring after a while and the thing i don\'t like about this app is that every time when you die it just goes onto an advert which are so annoying. Everything else i like and the app is actually quite good and funny aswell',

I think Dumb Ways to Die is awesome educator for kids and other things and stressed really fun to play and this review is going to get like a hundred likes so I\'m posting these for people and other stuff stuff I love you America so so much so so much scream loudly',
       'I think that there could be less ads. When I\'m trying to replay he game an ad pops up which is really annoying. What I would say is that this is an excellent game but just less of the ads',
       'Love it although can get annoying This game is really fun and I remember the oldest version and now it has more dumb ways to die which is amazing! Although some of the mini games are annoying no matter what I do I still die from them. Other than that, it\'s an amazing interactive game :)',
       'OMG BEST GAME EVERRR IT HAS SO MANY NEW GAMES IN IT & A SPECIAL VALENTINE\'S ADDITION! U CAN EVEN CREATE YOUR OWN DUMB WAY TO DIE CHARACTER!!!! PLEASE DOWNLOAD DONT MISS OUT! And about the ads there are a lot of them but if u turn of wifi and data then u won\'t have a problem with the ads cause they don\'t show up!              Please pledge to be safe aroun trains' ,

Though there are many glitches in the game, this is the second time in gonna have to download because it won\'t open. Overall, it\'s a fun game when it\'s not glitching',

      'Tekken is one of my favourite series in gaming. Previously i have some minor issues about all old getting delete but now my all data have recovered thats a minor bug in the which automatically log out your account from google play game or in facebook and then starts from beginning again but i have fixed this problem, for solving this problem just re-login in the game via play games or facebook, you get your data back. And seriously this is good game i love it, i am addicted of it.😊👍 but we need more character😅.',
       'Do u call this game management and do u guys call this a game... I just upgraded my phone software... Reinstall the game and lost all my account..everything i worked on it.. I tried reconnecting to my Google account.. It gave me the link to my previous account and asked me to restart the game...but nothing happened... I need my damn account',
       'Was excited, even pre-registered. But not happy with the cost and chances of getting characters worth paying with. And what are the pre-registration benefits. Not got any. It encourages you to buy characters worth real world money, lots of it. No. Becomes routine after some time. Only Injustice and the Batman Arkham games are the best, others are the rest.',
       'Thanks a lot for a fast reply. Game is awesome, though there might small small issues, but it\'s at an initial stage as well... I am expecting for the local challenge event to come soon... 😉',
       'Need a help from you Bandai Namco. Why i start again at level 1. Where\'s my level 36 account with more than 1K gem and 500thou+ coins. I did not clear any data on my phone. Please, fix my issue guys.',
       'I was really annoyed today... But its fixed now... Thanx guys... Hope u make this game even better.. Namco lived up to the expectations...' ,

      'I love playing slot machine games, and Pop Slots feels like the only game that does not immediately shoot me down when I get a little crazy/ ambitious with my betting. It is the ONLY game I have ever played where I\'ve hit the jackpots on multiple occasions. Now maybe it\'s all completely luck on my part, but it feels like a game that doesn\'t immediately take all of your money faster than you can collect it. It\'s very easy to level up with a good win streak, and those hourly and daily bonus grow pretty quickly. Love this game!',
       'Game is really fun to play probably my favorite, and is the best slot machine app. I\'ve been playing at least 5 years But have recently stopped because it\'s not fun if you hardly win. And I totally get that it\'s supposed to be like Vegas, Win some could lose a lot. But it\'s just a game, it\'s for entertainment and I get that you can redeem the gold chips for real rewards in Vegas, but that\'s not why I play. I play because the games and different casinos are fun along with the bonuses. I spend 11 million just to play the pirate gem bonus and only win back 5 million. I could really care less how frequent the gold chips are, you only get 1 in 4ish balloons anyway. I just want to PLAYYY. Especially the bonuses, but it takes forever sometimes for them to be triggered in some casinos. Any chance it can change?',
       'Great game at first but when you progress you pretty much play for 10 minutes wait for bonus. Started purchasing chips and then they seem to go quicker! I like that is not all win win but damn, throw a dog a bone every once in a while. Basically you throw money away paying for chips and NEVER, and I repeat, NEVER win!',
       'The way the game is set up is excellent but I give it 2 stars because you you almost never win any coins. You\'ll burn through the entire bit of your bonus coins without any winning spins. The game I play has a minimum bet of 7500 and you might win a couple payouts of 500 and a couple for 2500 and then it\'s game over after about a whole 3 minutes of play time then it\'s another 2 hours before you get more coins I mean come on loosen up a little',
       'They really trick you and rip you off with this game. For instance, the latest power up was the \'joker\' card, which is supposed to keep you streak going. The first 3 cards are free, and you are able to use them all in a row if needed. However, if you actually purchase any, suddenly you can only use one per game!! This led to nearly all of the purchased ones going unused. I wasted some of my xmas google play card on this rip off :( What a joke.',
       'This game robbed me. I had several million chips to play with on the eye of khan bonus board, and the game kicked me out! I checked my Wi-Fi signal and everything, it certainly wasn\'t a result of that. If they don\'t repay me for the lost chips, then you can bet I won\'t be playing this game again.' ,

      'I would give all 5 stars, but I have one issue. When I\'m doing surgeries, I start getting docked heartbeats because, even though my finger is moving along the screen, it\'s not fully cutting. Didn\'t have this problem when I first started playing a couple weeks ago. And when I suction, I\'m hitting every spot but it doesn\'t work well and takes forever. Or when I\'m trying to give an epinephrine shot, I keep going in the motion they say but nothing happens and I lose out. I\'m pressing the screen and moving in the right direction. Otherwise I love this game.',
       '***Update*** The game recently had an update, which is fine so far, but for the love of God I do not want to watch a 5 minute twitch video of some guy playing a game to earn a bonus reward. Sort yourselves out!  I would like this game more if while you\'re completing a surgery and an issue arises (heart attack, breathing, etc) the interphase was easier to use. The timing is way off, thus making it very difficult. There isn\'t even a tutorial with each new task.',
       'Stay clear people. After reaching level 11 and spending plenty £\'s on hearts, I had to do an update which sent me back to the start all over again. Therefore lost all my much effort and dedication to a then good game. Very frustrating and feeling cheated and conned!! 😢',
       'I love this game. But there is one problem. I have tried to upgrade reception room to level 3. I give 1 lakh and it showed me 24 hours to upgrade. Then i closed the app and after two hours it does not show any updates in progress. I lost my money and i have pending task with reception 3rd level.',
       'The game was working fine last night. Today it keeps crashing. I start the game and a minute later it crashes. When I start a surgery it crashes, so that wastes the energy. I feel like I spent my money on hearts for no reason. Please fix this issue!',
       'Is a good game to pass the time, but I have the Samsung Note8 and the stylus does not work in the game.  This is very disappointing because I believe that it would make it much better and you would have the feel of having a tool in your hand like a real surgeon.' ,

Like inside the hunger games movie... Many ways to stay alive, and to win. Overall this a great game to play single or with friend. Graphic amazing smooth, control its ok, movement is cool.

But the only problem is that I can join the servers most of the time it says that I have to select a server but when I press the button but nothing happens in the meantime my buddy\'s are already playing a game could someone please help',
       'Worst game ever. Every time I try to walk or run my character it lags soo much that he runs about 100 meters and is pushed back 100 as if I never covered that distance and this happens several time, means in stuck in a same location for really long time. Then there is this reconnecting issue where it keeps disconnecting and connecting after several secs, sometimes minutes. It\'s unbearable. Can\'t even cover the distance of 200 m. The character keeps on resetting to previous position. Worst game. Try other similar games.',
       'Really good game ,keeps getting better very update. please add a few things from survivor royal (50vs50 or zombies mode add skins for your gear like helmets and vest ) game is a 10/10 so far can\'t wait to see what you guys have planned for the next update',
       'I found a bug recently. when I updated my Android version to 8.0.0, it freezes at the loading screen. It stops at 72%. My device is Android one s2 and I tried reinstalling the game and it still freezes at the loading screen. The same thing happens in the game "survivor royale". I really love this game and I want to be able to play it again. Is there any way to fix this?' ,

      'I can\'t help but love a mobile game that doesn\'t constantly shove advertisements in your face. No silly energy system to make you wait to play, and while it has a real money store, it\'s tucked away in a corner where it belongs. Different control options and simple, accessible gameplay make this a hidden gem. 5 stars all the way. Kudos to the developer.',
       'This game would be perfect if the controls were better. They are nonsense. Doesn\'t always shoot when I tap, jumping is crazy, and the game gives you multiple ways to control, but they are all garbage. Also would have appreciated a tutorial so I knew what I was doing',
       'Excellent game, can\'t wait for a new map. There isn\'t any tutorials but it\'s quite a simple and fun game, you will catch on quick just be patient. Hope to see new maps soon don\'t make it too easy on us high levels now : )',
       'I really like the game. But there\'s one thing that annoys me: when I don\'t play this game for a few hours and then I do another battle in dungeon, the game crashes after killing last monster in that battle.  I found out that if I switch on mobile data it works. So I wanted to asked why is that. EDIT: now all works just fine. 5 stars',
       'I really love this game, it\'s super fun, the graphics are simplistic but stunning, one thing I really hope for in the future updates is an ability to save data and be able to continue a game of a different device. I can\'t wait for the next level and weapons update! Edit: the feature I was hopping off was added 5 stars!',
       'Lots of work to do on this game. It\'s very SOLID in gameplay and possibilites, but lacks a lot of content. Needs to gather gold while away from the game, as the grind is tremendous right now! There is no purpose in leveling up your mine past lvl 5 right now. It doesn\'t do anything. The game is very incomplete, but has a ton of potential.' ,

      'I play a lot of different mahjong tile games in my phone and in my opinion this is one of the better ones. I like how you can close the ads. I like how clear the tiles are. I like your selection of art on the tiles. They are a bit different from other tile sets on other games. This makes the game a bit more difficult as your eye is not adjusted to the \'standard\' (for lack of a better word) monotonous art on generic tile sets. I keep downloading and trying other games by other makers, just to delete them and try another. This is one of the mahjong games that I keep in the rotation of other mahjong games, on my phone. I have yet to be bored with it. I think I will keep it for quite a while.',
       'Easy to play and speeds up your visual and touch senses.   HATE the adverts...drives me crazy when I need to reshuffle and have to wait 30 seconds to resume play or start again. Other than that I like it',
       'I want so badly to give 5 stars fully, but I\'m not too thrilled that paying the fee to remove the ads doesn\'t remove them fully. Other than that, I love it. The ads even after paying take up too much time though, which is a deterrent for wanting to play it more frequently.',
       'I think I really like this game. It helps me remember things. And yes I enjoy playing games that will help me remember things. Great work to you and your team on creating this game. And also I really like the music compare to the other games. Keep up the good work. Please pass this to the others.',
       'It would vastly improve game play if the ads didn\'t pop up when shuffling. By the time the timed ads finish you\'ve lost the game and have to start all over. Somewhat frustrating.',
       'Why do you ask what I think? If you  mean my opinion of this app, I don\'t \'think\' anything. There\'s is no tutorial and none of the buttons I poked did anything. Besides which I don\'t know the game anyway so the thing is not only   useless  but hopeless if it did come up with any response to any of the buttons' ,

      'Pretty good design, but there is a cheater mode which tells you when one is wrong even if it\'s not apparent. So the fastest times are always really fast even for the hard ones. Also the ad bar is right below the numbers so you accidentally hit it when you play. Pretty sure that\'s intentional to get extra clicks, but super annoying.',
       'I love this game. I can play nice and easy games when I have "brain fog" or when I\'m feeling better play the hard games. Still haven\'t been able to finish an expert one in under 30 mins although I will keep on trying.  I understand the need for ads but putting them between each game is ridiculous!',
       'The ads are too frequent (after each game play) very annoying, and you have to wait too long for the option to close them.  If I wanted those other games I would have downloaded them already.  I\'ll probably uninstall because of the ads.',
       'Over all....quite nice, challenging but not throw the bloody phone difficult. I really like the colour options. So far I\'ve completed all january and most of the up to date febuary puzzle. 8/10 always room for improvement but definitely worth a few moments here and there.',
       'I NEVER thought I would like this game. As it turns out it is so much fun...so far. I\'m just a beginner. Soduku is a very addictive game and thrilling when you "get it!" This particular game is designed very simply and clearly, which I like. The only drawback (hence only 4 stars) is that the "choosing" numbers at the bottom are spaced too close to each other and I often tap the wrong one accidentally, making my choice incorrect. They need to be a larger or thicker font or be further apart from each other. Otherwise I am excited to move my levels forward.',
       'The game in itself isn\'t bad but I\'ve completed a puzzle in 10 minutes and for the past half an hour I don\'t know what to do next, does it pop up on the screen \'You have finished\' or do we just move on? I\'ve been looking for any place that I\'ve gone wrong but I haven\'t found any' ,

      'EarnFreeMoney👇 DownIoad "UNOPAY" App Enterr (ALEXA) to Start Earning So far so good. Fun way to get Money. Won\'t make you rich but the extra cash is helpful. It\'s also the best exchange rate on points. 3000 points equals $6 instead of like some of the others where it takes 3300 points to reach $1 etc....Also, TOYOCASH App is very reliable in paying you when you redeem to Paypal. You can choose assorted giftcards as payment or transfer to Paypal for cash. Your choice. I love these guys thanks for adding some fun to my day.',
       'Finally! For the the longest time I\'ve been waited, the gaming performance has been improved! No more annoying lag and the gameplay feel a lot smoother now and I am so happy about it. But the graphics still needs to be improved because it doesn\'t look too good and some minor bug needs to be fixed.',
       'Favourite Shark game in the entire world. I became obsessed because it\'s so addictive and fun. The graphics are amazing, disappointed when I got my new phone I lost my progress even when I used the smart transfer to transfer the app. I\'ve had to start all over again... but the fun continues!',
       'This game is really addictive and i love it but i own everything now so I don\'t play anymore. I occasionally get on just to check for new stuff and they do put out new stuff but it takes a long, loooonggggg time. Please put new sharks out and don\'t make us wait foreverrrr!',
       'It\'s a fun game and I\'m enjoying it. However, I\'ve come from Hungary Shark Evolution and find that the tilt controls in World are vastly inferior to Evolution. Is there a way they can be made more effective? As it stands, I actually have to bend over just to get my shark to swim to the surface. Not fun at all.',
       'Fun time waster, can get quite a lot sunk into it, and get e erything without paying up. Glad its always been grindable. Just has had trouble connecting for saves. I lost everything a couple years ago before they had cloud saves... They\'re here now and aside from a logout/in they are wonderous afaik. Good stuff!' ,

      'I\'m 11 and i love it so much.I have some Ideas for a toca kitchen 3. You can be able to make sandwiches and soups or stews. And more ingredients, more people. And you could add mustard and mayonnaise. Wait Maybe you could make tacos and weird ones. These are just  suggestions but I would love to see some of these suggestions. You would call it Toca Kitchen 3, with a nice logo. I did like toca kitchen 1 & 2. It is fun to play and food, and when we mess up to see how the people eating the food react. Bye.',

Keep up the good work! And make sure to make more today games free! Because then everyone will love you!',
       'I\'m giving a 5 star rating, not cuz I like this game but because I want you to make all your games free or at least the toca life:city or vacation. Please I always wanted that game because It looks really fun and it must be. You probably won\'t make them free but if you can, make toca life city free at least',
       'This is the best game ever it is also funny because I was giving the girl food and I gave her some strawberries and I put a lot of lemon, hot sauce, Barbiecu sauce,Manas,keckup,salt, and pepper... SO funny, it also sounds just like a kid is playing with the food, that I\'m eating grapes right now,😂😂😂😂😁😀😊☺🙂😐',
       'I want YOU to read this Toca Boca I love it! But I have to ask, Why is there bread if you can\'t make a sandwich? Also can you make there a way to make soup? I really like your games but I am only 10,how do you expect me to pay for the games. At make 5 free like this!' ,

      'Pretty cool game. Like the simple concept of taking something we have all done at one time or another and turning it into a video game.  Genius. I really like the sense of accomplishment I get when I make a trick shot like a bank shot off the boss\'s head and no rim just straight in! It\'s like he shoots he scores! The crowd goes wild! ..fake crowd roar...',
       'The game makes me feel things down in my nether region super fun to play. When I throw the paper ball I\'m like sweeeeeeeeet. I daydream about playing when I\'m at work. The second I get home I get undressed and play me some paper toss.  Thanks you guys over at paper Toss you really know how to have a great time. If you guys would like to hang out some time and toss some paper I\'d be down. hit me up some time',
       'Wow, this game is fantastic! How have I not downloaded this before?? The controls are easy to use and very responsive. So far I haven\'t run into any bugs so that\'s good. I really enjoy using different objects to throw in place of the paper ball, which is actually my favorite. The fact that each object is affected differently by the fan makes this game flavorful. Really great job with this!!',
       'Disappointing. Paper Toss Boss used to be known as Paper Toss 2, though the name isn\'t all that has changed. For one thing, there are now WAY too many ads. Every time I change a level, an ad comes up. Inexcusable. And to make it worse, the game lags more. If my old Android 2.2 phone can run Paper Toss 2 with no problem, then the same should be said with this version and my new Android phone. Considering it a classic game ruined.',
       'After the last update the game sucks so bad. Tons of add, lag, the interface moves poorly, after 5 minutes i just gave up and uninstalled it. Used to be so much fun before. Please go back to the previous versiob!',
       'It\'s ok, but the game doesn\'t shoot the ball half the time you swipe, causing you to always miss. And if you\'re playing a game where the goal is high points, losing because the game sucks is frustrating and makes it not worth playing.  Maybe they should\'ve concentrated on accuracy vs the graphics...' ,

       'Well the game is okay but its so laggy and there is no commentary, its like playing football with no commentary. Pliz add that and then the life regeneration time is too long. Make it 30mins at least. Conteols need improvement and finally the guy run like fellaini. Speed is low it neexs a fix.',
       'The adds killed the game, every time you do anything it\'s a 30s video and it kills the game. I loved the old games and it hasn\'t moved on much over the years apart from the new game modes that you have to pay for',
       'It\'s is a good and enjoyable game but more action is needed.... I\'ve played for a long time but haven\'t received a card, it also needs some commentary.....AND BUYING THE FULL GAME,,, WHAT\'S THE USE OF DOWNLOADING IT THEN',
       'Is fun for a bit but no chance of winning on pro mode. Impossible to get a turnover or regain ball in the ruck for long. Need to keep scoring off of kick off. Also more ad watching than actual playing the fame',

      'I wish I could post pictures, but the game is too easy. I beat the first 2 levels both on one attempt. Though I am an experienced geometry dash player. But if I can beat a level first try, not knowing the course at all, that\'s some easy stuff. I highly recommend geometry dash sub zero though.',
       'I love every Geometry Dash version! And this one might be the best. But my only downfall is that the music, which is freaking awesome,gets ahead of the actual gameplay and I miss my jumps. Plz fix and I\'ll rate 5 stars! But keep up the good work!',
       'Great fun but needs more levels. I laughed when I saw a review made by an idiot because he said this was a copy of the Impossible Game LOL it\'s the other way around, dumbass.',
       'Hardly worth downloading. I love the full version of the game and figured this world be similar, or at least have some interesting levels, but much to my dismay it does not. The levels are easy and somewhat boring, which is unfortunate because Geometry Dash is usually neither of those things.',
       'I think it should be more easy it\'s kind of hard and RobTop Games can you plz ohh plz add more levels to try   ok so now I\'m even more upset it keeps on not jumping when I want it tooo!!! I will and I mean I will keep lowering the stars until you fix it!!! I am fed up with this but I will keep the app',
       'This is the worst game ever but it\'s so good even I have to pull my hair out of my face for it! It\'s the worst but the best at the same time! Even my mom plays it! And she doesn\'t have any games on her phone except this.' ,

      'I love these games, really, and I was on a roll, but I can\'t get pass level 48 because my Wiko LENNY3 touch screen isn\'t responsive enough to register both fingertips at the same time. EDIT: I was too quick to judge the alternative way to be wrong. Thank you Bart, for your response. I retried what you said and had no trouble finishing the game. Can\'t wait to see the next game. You have a beautiful mind. These things you create, are a work of art.',
       'This game and yellow have single handedly improved my relationship with my niece. She loves playing these games over and over every time she comes to visit. Christmas day she didn\'t want to play with her gifts, she just wanted to sit with me and play yellow. It means so much to me. Thank you for making these games.',
       'By far one of the best puzzle creators for Android games! I was hoping for another "Yellow 2", and changing the color really surprised me, Looking forward to... Blue? (PS: after playing for a while, All I see is orange :P)',
       'Brilliant follow-up to YELLOW! ACCEPT NO SUBSTITUTES! And, there ARE games trying to pretend that they\'re the same...only Bart Bonte does it right!  I try not to let myself do too many levels at once, just so I can extend the game. I can\'t wait for the next color!',
       'Bart Bonte is a genius! If I see his name, I know I will love it. I just finished this one tonight and I loved every minute. I only needed the clues for the very last level because I\'m familiar with Bart\'s mind by now. &lt;3 I think it\'s great that clues are available though and that they don\'t give everything away right away. It\'s a big bummer when that happens on other games. Love, your die-hard fan! Please make another one soon!',
       'Thank you, thank you, thank you, Bart Bonte! I\'ve been waiting for a very, very long time for this game to come out since I first played "Yellow". Thanks a lot! But here are a few other questions I have for you: what will be the next game? How long will I have to wait until the next game comes out? Could you at least give me a hint? Thanks!' ,

      'I don\'t have any problem with the game but the problem is that I don\'t like that miniclip is adding the bot because the game is less popular or don\'t know but to win against a bot is very tough you cannot win a match against them. I am losing my many coin because of bots. To recognise bot player they will be in guest with 6 digit number and having same level or somewhat close to it.',
       'Every once in a while when I get on I try to click my free spin and it won\'t work. So it\'s like my phone froze but I can play every other app. So it\'s just this game that freezes every once and a while. I have shut my phone down and turned it back on but I\'m not going to do that for every time I want to get on the app. I do really love it. It\'s just that it freezes so I can barely play it.',
       'There is a bug in your game I went first of my league, supposingly I am entitled to 350 cash, but it wasn\'t there.  How could you make it so unfair for someone. Why bother having a prizes if not given to the right person.',
       'Uninstalled and reinstalled app because the update made it to where the game was unplayable. Went to login, using Facebook credentials. It says it failed because I would not allow them access to my friends list. Something doesn\'t seem right about that. Never had a game NOT allow me to login, after denying access to my friends list. Sorry, would prefer you not send messages to all my friends with my name tagged on it.',
       'I am in love with this game.. But the only bad thing happened today and I\'m very disappointed. I won carnival cup so I should get the announced price which includes 2 VIP  cards also. I didn\'t get my prize and I\'m really very upset. I have a screenshot of winning cup also.. I hope miniclip will help me. I\'m expecting my prize from you. I really love this game.',
       'Uncanny how the opponent in shooting race goes for the same target as me more often than not and is generally quicker. Seems similarly biased in free kick mode. It\'s almost as if you aren\'t allowed to progress unless you spend a load of money.' ,

      'Great strategy based game, awesome, however out of 326 levels only 323 could be completed. Level 324 the colors are not chain linked they are totally erratic and the colors you\'re given are inconsistent. They alternate in color as well to ensure failure. Still I enjoyed it. Side note, I played the game without using any cheats, which is the reason level 324 is a trapdoor the idea is to purchase cheats. Thanks great game.',
       'Fun, but... Worst aim system. You can see ball curve away instead of following straight path. Color balls rotate without your input. You are shooting blue, but yellow goes instead. This happens very frequently. Lastly, had 20 straight of same color. Only needed one of another color to finish that level. Still playing, but game is very frustrating.',
       'Takes so long to start a level you have lost interest in the game before it starts. Keeps my attention for about 30 secs. Phone will not respond to button presses after game has finished.',
       'The coding in this game obviously needs work.  Balls given not colors needed.  Spot aimed at missed and ball lands somewhere else.  The last chest I opened lvl 30 something gave no item.',
       'It is inexcusable to allow ads to make such noise when both my phone is in silent mode AND I have the sound off in the game settings! I went over other reviews and the developers wanted to know which ads. Seriously?! How about all of them?! They have to be aware yet refuse to fix the problem. Do not download this intrusive app. Also I get a migraine with the annoying "Ready? Let\'s go!" voice when the sound is on.',

      'I never had to pay a single cent for this game, and it\'s working out perfectly fine for me. Sure, you can pay for more coins and items to level up quicker - but you can enjoy the game without paying anything. I get raided too but on a fairly acceptable basis. I love this game. Only thing is, I don\'t like my non-responsive faction members and I\'m worried once I leave my faction I couldn\'t join another one. Ah well. That being said, 5 stars for the game.',
       'This game is a treasure! It has kept me entertained for about 1 year and a half so far! I love the story parts and maps and I want to congratulate the developers! Good job, Nice graphics, Great game. Although, I lost my save file because this game doesn\'t make any easy whatsoever to load save files. Please fix that! Thanks!',
       'No one from the support team will respond. My game was unistalled and reinstall and I lost 2 years worth of data. Can\'t remember sync it and I know scopely can do it for me. I\'ve provided everything they need and still nothing via email or in-game support. Will change my rating if this is sorted',
       'I can\'t get passed the opening narration page. Therefore, I can\'t even play! The "skip" button doesn\'t work! The "next" button doesn\'t work either! I\'d have given 0 stars if possible. I won\'t change my review until after the issue is solved. I\'m using the most recent update for Android and Google play.',
       'I love the game it\'s really epic. But one thing that pisses me off is during the tournament for survival after completing a level with 3 stars there is this part where u have to claim tokens ND after claiming the game crashes  ND starts again. So could u please fix that would mean a lot.. otherwise I got no other problems',
       'This game is my absolute favorite on my android im a huge TWD fan so this is a Great game offering the zombie rpg style awesomness! They keep updating the game and the new update is amazing with recent faction boss battle assaults, a gear shop, friendly faction battles! I suggest this game highly if you enjoy turn based, zombie smashing fun!' ,

      'An awesome game based on tap tap tap. Enchanting bgm. Little customisation of the girl.  Some improvement could be made in that there should be a story. Maybe. There are so many umbras in a country. Destroy them all and that country lights back up. Giving you bonuses and such like. Thus progressing the girls quest to save all the fey and light the world again. Would also give us players something to aim for other than tap tap tap.',
       'This game is amazing!!! The little faries and feys (idk what you call em) are super cute. The grafics are great. And I really like that if you close the game the faries collect the money stuff for you while your away. This game is a great time killer and its so addicting.the little dresses you can pick are really nice too. It will auto attack for you so that\'s nice. The only thing wrong is that the monsters don\'t attack. Over all I really love the game though😊.',
       'The game is beautiful. All the tapping sort of gets to you after a while. I thought the main character would be able to move about and there was more dimension. Like if there were different level in the game and she could move between those levels, etc. Go high and low to cancel out the dark, and so on.',
       'It\'s a great game. The Bgm in the background sounds enchanting and makes me happy while I play the game. The developer might want to add story updates because the girl and Fey have a mission to defeat the evil, but no real mission after you start completing stages. I think it would be nice to have more story in this game.',
       'This game is absolutely NOTHING like everyone thought it was going to be. There really isn\'t much to it other than tapping the screen. Every time you get to character level 650 you can perform  "Light Up!" Which basically ends the current "world" and you start all over again while keeping certain bonuses. It\'s addicting to me and I don\'t know why because unfortunately it\'s pretty basic and boring :(....',
       'AMAZING!!!👏👏👏👏👏👏👏I loved it I was looking for games to play during a 10 hour car ride, and I found it. Also I got to keep my other games too meaning this doesn\'t take up much storage, Wich is awesome. My only complaint is that the monsters are a little too easy. Even the bosses 1.8k hp 5 seconds later done. Other that that it\'s amazing.' ,

      'Nice game with very good events but the drop rates to heroes of 5 star is too low i killed a lot of gems and scrols and hero orbs and my first 5 star i  dropped it at lvl 75. Okok now again event of summoning 100 scrolls and i continue still no 5 star hero only 4, just try and fix the drop rate. In the rest its a nice game.',
       'Wasn\'t sure about this game at first. I love it. I use a f2p  and a vip one  to see  the difference  between the two. Really well done. Having said all that the game does require patience. This is an IDLE game. You pick it up do dailies, talk, spend money, or what ever you want to do in game, then put it down to "farm gold,xp,mats". The high end heros do take some planning to aquire as a f2p player. This game requires patience because it\'s an IDLE game. Yes some people have a ton of money to throw at the game but don\'t be jealous, just play your game and have fun.',
       'Nice graphics, intuitive control, fun. In the beginning, it was a little too much going on for my ADHD self, but now I\'ve been playing for a couple months and it\'s my favorite mobile game of all time. I love collecting all the interesting heroes as well as saving for events and seeing what RNGsus  will bring next!  My only complaint right now is that their notification system is whack. Especially in the beginning, it\'s easy to miss things you can do.',
       'Too much pay to win, free players hardly getting anywhere in the events and so fourth, not fair, increase the rewards of spending money and give free players more too easily solved, I previously rated it 5 stars instantly loved it but as I\'ve progressed it\'s just not fair!! Please do something!! I am vip6 but I\'m not rich, please bring more rewards for loyal free users who watch the ads and everything!! Thank you!!',
       'Not what I expected, given that my first impression of it was of IH being an "annoying add". Once I decided to pick it up though my thoughts changed rather drastically.   It\'s simple, it\'s fun and the warm colour palette of the graphics make a nice change compared to the widespread use of bleak colours in other games.   If you think you might enjoy this game, you sure are my friend.',
       'I purchased the spring festival card on top of all the money I\'ve already dumped into this game and the devs didn\'t give me my in game rewards. I\'ve submitted numerous tickets to get a refund or my rewards and they just reply there is no problem. Ya no problem with you taking my money.  They deleted my review, wonder how many other people had this issue and had reviews deleted.' ,

      'I downloaded this game and the very next morning my phone got hacked. I\'m not saying it was definitely related to the game softwares but I have no way of knowing, so I will not be installing this again. Also its clearly a straight theft of  Minecraft with only some textues and sounds changes. Blatant copy write theft.',
       'I love this game but you can\'t open chest or crafting table or stove. About the houses: it\'s really fun and easy to build the houses. And also it\'s one of the best and exiting Minecraft game ever!!! But like I said you can\'t open anything😑 But other than that in love it can you please fix the changes that I want if you can please!! Thank you!!😊',
       'I went all unsure but three stars.It was the best game I played but 21 days after I downloaded the game was broken! I went to my map and my dogs head became a leg!?.my brother had this game to and I played on is server.but then his body was broken!. Next thing he was invisible!.please fix the bugs on this game and I\'ll give you five stars.',
       'DO NOT WASTE YOUR DATA ON THIS PIECE OF TRASH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!impossible to see at night due  to ads. ever walk around outside after midnight with a flashlight in your hand pointed at your face? well the ads make it hard as hell to see at night. i have started this game six times and cannot see anything happenning at night. and that is too big of a flaw for me tocontinue to use a game. paid 7 bucks and downloading the real minecraft right now. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME!!!!!!',
       'At first the game was great but then there were a few things that need to be added. First of all, you can\'t crouch, second of all,it doesn\'t have texture packs, and make the graphics like the real version of momentary. If you add these, I will give you 5 stars.',
       'OMG THIS GAME IS EPIC!!!!!!!!! I have 1 question, there are these holes in the ground  (in creater mode) and the holes have iron and sapphires but I\'m scared 2 go in. What are they and is it 100% safe 2 go in the tunnels? At the moment, I just block them up. Plz tell me! Oh and I LOVE the fact that the game saves on its own!!!!!' ,

Additional to that i saw therr locked 200 diamonds i clicked one of that and all my 420 diamonds gone and onlu 220 diamonds left and its showing me 2 big circle white and pink.. that\'s not fair....',
       'Found a game called "Infinite Balls" on my friend\'s iPhone, we loved it. This is the best Android alternative we could find, but it\'s not quite as satisfying. Balls are never randomized, there are no circular objects for the balls to bounce off from and neither an infinite mode. Also you  have to get used to the controls. Would be nice to turn off the help lines, too.',

      'Well,This Game Is Kinda Good.Im Gonna Rate It For 5 Stars In The First Place But It Changed My Mind After That. The Graphics Is Good,The Controls Are Good Too And Everything is really good. BUT THE ONLY PROBLEM it is very LAGGY. Maybe Next Time When You Make An Another Update,Make some improvemnts of not being laggy. PLS.',
       'This game is a dream come true!!!!! Firstly the controls are phenomenal, graphics are astonishing and techniquely... everything in this game is the best. Minecraft is already becoming stupid because of the high payments as they are the most creative crafting game. Well guess what? This is even more creative. Minecraft is just dumb. Art is good everything is good about minecraft but what gives for the price. While this app is the best and freee!!!',
       'Better than minecraft at crafting. No hp so no problem fall from high ground. If ure creative, this is a must have apps. Its abit slow to build, still better than minecraft mobile. Ive built a big croc and built inside its body houses.',
       'Lots of fun, creative and very easy!  Review update: I reinstalled in 2018 to find it has changed. You cant dig down very far like you could before, or down to water (it only floods a little bit in places) so I couldn\'t make a moat for the castle.',
       'This game is great, building is easy enough with the help of the system, and visiting other maps is a great feature. however for free players who just want to build, you would find that the available blocks are extremely limited. Other blocks cost 50gems (per block) and ~200 gems are already 4$.. Customizing avatar and villagers can go up to 10k gems since individual items are minimum 1k gems. Great game, if you\'re willing to go broke',
       'It\'s pretty cool I mean I like how you get to it like by all sorts of things and I\'ll tell you where you can place the blocks and it where the white cut-out boxes you can like click on it and it\'ll go through walls and you can just have a little bit of fun really cool thanks whoever built this thank you for allowing this game to be exactly like Minecraft and but it\'s like a whole little combined station of Minecraft and one of those block things I can\'t remember what it was one of those' ,

      'The game is buggy and needs some work. For me the game does not go ahead and it points on Unlocking the chest when the other chest is in process of Unlocking. None of the functions work, clearing cache, dalvik has no impact. Game works only after uninstall and again install.  Edit : the game is super smooth now . The shadow energy required to upgrade an element is increased manifold without corresponding increase in drop chances of epic and legendary chest. Hence a star removed.',
       'Hey,  Guys install it it\'s fun to play shadow fight 3.  NEKKI I loved the game but it got uninstall by me and I again installed it but it asks to download an additional file that is too done by me but when the file gets completed (15mb) the game doesn\'t start it remains on 15mb only.  Please see the issue and inform me.',
       'I have given 5 stars earlier because it was early in the game. Even in chapter one, you can\'t really progress because there is no way to make more coin other than the side quest which needs hours to refresh. In the end, you kinda not able to do anything but wait. You can\'t even replay earlier fights to earn some coins. Different mechanics than the 2. Boo.. Uninstaling..',
       'Few suggestions: 1. Add an escape roll or a quick recovery move when downed 2. Beating an opponent in duel should reduce the opponent\'s trophies. It will help in balancing match ups that appear in duels 3. Add an option to discard chests after winning a duel. It\'s most definitely a pay to win game  right now.. hope it gets better',
       'Controls have been ruined with the latest update. They are responsive only for a few moments in the beginning. You are ruining the game with every update Nekki. Every fight in the main quest shows impossible and insane levels. Our 15 hits is equal to 3 hits of other players. It seems very hard to play the game without spending money. I have only stuck to the game because of the story, otherwise I would have deleted it too earlier.',
       'The game is cool and action packed but the only way to level up is to play the main campaign and there are no achievements with rewards to help you out. Also the ai difficulty seems like it knows your next move and not only that but each level is so much harder than the last. Plz fix' ,

      'I absolutely love this this slot app. The only thing that is missing is dancing drums! It is by far the best out of all of the rest that SG has made, or any of its competitors had made to be completely honest. Their prices are great and the honestly hit pretty well. The only complaints I really have is no dancing drums yet and no social interaction like maybe huuuge casino has. I can\'t wait till they have these in a VR Casino with social interactions. Will be amazing!',
       'Spun easily 600+ times on Fu Dao Le without a 3 Gong bonus round.  Only bonuses were initiated by the appearances of the babies.  Bonus rounds will not trigger on their own.  Same with several other games that the developer rigged to not trigger bonuses.  Will not purchase any more credits.',
       'Game is pretty good in app purchases dont always work.  Been hosed a few times , transaction takes place money comes out of acct. But no coins were given , once ok but several times not good. Has issues watch your money and spend wisely id suggest',
       'REFUND  your money immediately if you are not happy with your purchase. It\'s design only for RIP OFF.  Hard to win.  They just want you to buy to play.  Customer support is just a joke. one of the BIGGEST CHEATING, GREEDY, RIP OFF APP in the market.',
       'the app is not responding when you win big. i won 9M+ couple of times the app is not responding. now i won 236M the app did not reapond again and then the credits were not applied.  hate it. it happened again just now i won 100M+ twice almost 500M credits ive lost and was not credited. i will delete the app now and will never play again.',

       'The ads are so Terrible they interrupt gameplay now so if you were placing a block forget it it just placed itself because it registers that you let it go. Good game but not worth the annoyance.',
       'Really you have no idea what\'s coming next, so you can\'t plan on your next strategic move. Its all luck if you make it to the next round or not. So theres no challenge. I do appreciate the fact it has no ads.',
       'Foolishly made game, many a times the three blocks they send don\'t even fit in the remaining blocks. I mean, u shud send the blocks such that people shud love thinking where they all will fit, if allowed in comments I would have sent screen shot of game where I lost in it, to ask u guys where the hell these three blocks fit. I wud suggest to take it as an error in ur game n resolve it.',
       'Addictive! Enjoy playing. Of course there are ads! The developers have to fund themselves! Not 5* because the graphics are a little"out"... The block is displaced from my touch location',
       'Very addictive. Adds annoying, but If there were no adds it wouldn\'t be free.' ,

And this is first time i\'m very exited when i managed to finish a level, even after that, i repeat again till i can surpass it perfectly. Even i haven\'t sleep for 2 days, felt like an alien or zombie, etc. But this game cheers me up alot. Recommended ? Yes! Good job dev, just download it guys. Lu pasti hepi dah! Keren!',
       'Wow... as I was writing this review it suddenly all disappeared as it said unfortunately traffic rider has stopped. Wow.. nice. I cannot even open the game without freezing up my tablet. Real nice. And tbh I love this game! On my phone it works..... 😥😣😈👹',
       'One of the best motorcycle game to date, weather conditions are great, bikes are great and handling is great, but the bad ai on higher difficulty level a few times are ridiculous and messes up everything.  Sometimes a truck speeds up to 150km/h just to close off that small gap, where you could slip through, but next time all cars in all lane slow down at once, so you can\'t pass anywhere, even though there\'s nothing in front of them. This is really annoying, when every second counts and there\'s no way to pass them for 4-7 seconds. Apart from this the game is great. The keep changing weather conditions is great too.',
       'There are some idiot missions such as combo overheading. I would give this game 5 stars if not those missions.',
       'LMAO I CAN\'T SEE THE WHEEL ROTATING ON BIKES LIKE HD FROD TOMA AND OTHER VISIBLE FRONT TIRES, CAN YOU FIX THIS PLEASE COZ I REALLY LIKE THE GAME. THANKS',
       'Gave one star less because the missons lack mathematical accuracy There was this level to travel 8 kms in 130s and it was showing it an easy mission with a bike of top speed 172 kph 😂 The graphics and gameplay are superb I like the game' ,

      'lnstaII \'VEARN\' App Enterr (CRETA) to Start Earning So far so good.Fun way to get money. Won\'t make you rich but the extra cash is helpful. It\'s also the best exchange rate on points. McEarn points equals mc instead of like some of the others where it takes VEarn points to reach vc etc...Also, lnstaII \'TOYOCASH\' App Enterr (TRDG) very reliable in paying you when you redeem to toyocash. You can choose assorted giftcards as payment or transfer to Walet for cash. Your choice. I love these guys thanks for addingsome fun to my day.',
       'First, I don\'t like that the game is in realtime it makes it a lot less fun and more boring. Secondly, I don\'t like that you HAVE to buy things just to get vip. I know that the prices are quite low but if you\'re just a kid like me then that limits what you can do. Lastly, I want more jobs and maybe even school to be playable it would just seem reasonable and make the game more addicting. Overall the game is really enjoyable but could do better, still keep up the good work!',
       'im not sure what\'s the cause of the problem but what i know is the sims\' act a lil bit freaky. i just redownloaded this game bcs i cant log in this game before bcs i just updated it. before this, the sims is ok, but now they act really awkward. when they\'re walking, they legs dont even move! it\'s like they\'re flying, plus when they\'re doing any action like "clean the dishes", they dont move, they just stand still in front of the sink. this is freaky. please reply to my review bcs i really want to know more about this. i really like this game except what i said above. this game is really addicting:).',
       'I like everything about this game no questions asked but i do find a few things annoying the main one is selling items in you inventory 1 at a time i wish there was a sell all for an item that would make this less annoying  to sell after house building and such. Please add a sell all oh and when do you think you can make more quests i really like doing them.',
       'Overall,  this is a great game. Two requests.  1) Selling multiple items at once.  I bought a load of junk and I need to sell it!  2) Make the schools "playable",  like the police station. I was talking to my sister about this and it\'d be cool if the schools were playable and you could build clubs inside it. Anyway,  I loved everything in the game! So fun,  so creative.',

      'Ok, so I will be calm in this review. Whenever I have the same car in a battle with red, we ram each other, but they push me off the map with ease. The main reason why I wrote a review for this game is that you should make the alien levels a little easier. The last level for it is way too hard, you can barely aim at the boss. The controls are hard too. Also can you optimize the game for the Samsung Galaxy tab A?',
       'New update stucks a lot and 1st time my mobile hangs a lot due to this game and btry drains faster than ever. plz crt these mistakes to continue njoying this game',
       'Ok. I admit this game is pretty fun. But the missions, especially the hardcore ones, are ridiculously hard. So if you want a challenge, I recommend this game. But if you rage over really dumb things like me, then I definitely do not recommend it.',
       'I have a problem. It won\'t let me  replay what I did its bad I want it fixed. Can you help?',
       'I think its really fun but the new update is bad in my opinion because for the superstar mission chest you can\'t get bolts anymore which makes it harder to get bolts so I have 600 bolts and I\'m so close to get a legendary car so yeah I think u guys should put back the getting bolts thing love you guys',

      'I really like the concept of this game. Unfortunately I am not prepared to even give it one star as it doesn\'t take you long to realize that the only aim from this game is to extract money from all who wish to play. Pitiful really as there are many similar games available which you don\'t have to feel pressure to buy',
       'The game is very fun, but I only get to play one or two hands before I have to wait another hour to get more credits to play. Would be a lot better if you got more credits for wins or had free play. I\'m not spending money to buy credits. Also, it would be great if there was an option to turn off the fancy card movements; I get motion sick from it.',
       'Its great game love that I don\'t need Wi-Fi to play it. But some of levels just get so impossible to beat you spend four day on one level. Make the crops pay out more and levels make them a bit easier make the challenges be the hard ones.',
       'Great game concept, great graphics, however it really sucks that the amount of coins required to play  increases too much and you don\'t get enough coins. I wish it didn\'t cost so much to play, it seems like they just want you to actually buy more coins. No thanks. Will be deleting.',
       'way better than other solitaire games ive played! super fun, easy to navigate, and although you have to use a currency (credits) to play each game, you\'re never on the brink of bankruptcy, and there are ways to earn it without playing. really awesome game!!!',
       'Gambling trap...don\'t waste your time. Gorgeous graphics pull you in, then the app won\'t allow you to finish your game without forcing you to buy more points, etc. A complete waste of time. It is NOT "free." I felt very deceived.' ,

       'Good but buggy Good but buggy, one can earn infinite money in no time then u can upgrade ur vehicle to the max in the very first level. That destroys the fun of the game. Second if u have money in millions, the cost of the parts are also in million and so on, and even having millions of dollars in the game u might fail to upgrade vehicle sometimes  that makes no sense.',
       'I really like this game and its one that I can play continuously, my only problem is that I can only play once a day.. the game will work for as long as I play but as soon as I exit I can\'t back on until the following day. It sucks because I have to complete as much of the game as possible in a certain amount of time and that kills the fun. I can\'t just enjoy it and play a bit then carry on playing a bit later.. please fix this I really enjoy.this game and its getting ruined a bit for me...',
       'I like this game but i faced a problem. When i tried to make a purchase of INR 89.99 for this game,  balance has deducted but no coins or other benefits added in my account.  What is that?  When i searched on google for any helping contact email id or website, there is no email for help.  So tell me,  what should I do? Either solve my problem or i am going to file a case against you. Contact me as soon as possible.',
       'Yesss. I complete this game in 7 days. I can\'t understand the ending why that cantenar shake. It\'s mean the zombie are in the cantenar? It\'s mean part 3 will exist? Awesome game. I feel happy and relef when I complete the game and go on that ship. I think there will be a helicopter because in start there is a helicopter. But nevermind awesome game. Make part 3. Bye..... And I read there is hidden kits? What is this. Why I don\'t read it before. I can\'t find any kit. But what is kit? Nevermind I completed the game. One more time. Awesome game. Bye.....',
       'My problem with the gane comes from some sort of bug that started like an ad mid-run, then it started doing some weird rainbow pattern that flipped 90 degrees every few seconds. Now the game doesnt function when you try to start a run and the problem even persisted to my home screen before I closed the application.' ,

      'If you\'ve liked the first game you\'re probably gonna enjoy this one. It\'s more dynamic and there are plenty more content. Unfortunately it\'s built around microtransactions so if you\'re feeling like expending some money things might get easier. I just don\'t understand how they  screwed the controls this much, it\'s likely you\'re going to try placing a plant more than three times before making it.',
       'Great game. Lots of fun. For those who aren\'t aware: Some levels are super hard to beat BECAUSE THEY REQUIRE UPGRADED PLANTS. Level up gives you something to do in the game expanding its lifespan. Level up is not that easy. Don\'t expect to end all levels Ancient Egypt with level 2 plants; level 3 or 4 are fine!',
       'I was unable to launch the game for some stupid reason.....i sent several messages to the developers email seeking help,but everytime i get a same reply,asking me to visit the ea gaamjng website. It doesnt work,and seems like the message the developer replied is auto generated. Does popcap/ea rlly take time to fix it? Pls help me,i dont wanna miss out on speacial events. Thanks',
       'You know, this game is about plants. And zombies. Its also about Battling through in an attempt to get those damn zombies off your lawn by using some damn evolved plants to shoot \'em down back to the ground in ancient egypt, the far future and many other times! Now go get crazy Dave that taco!',
       'Please help! The game crashed so I reinstalled it, now none of my progress is saved even though I\'m signed in to Google+, this is the 2nd time this had happened and I can\'t start from scratch again. Can someone suggest a resolution Please?',
       'Latest update caused the game to hang on the \'starting...\' screen. I had to re-install the game. Luckily my save had synced (this time). (Playing on Samsung Galaxy S7 edge). Besides that problem, I love this game! It\'s one of the best \'freemium\' games about. The amount of content that is free is consistantly awesome and expands all the time. I also love that, unlike other freemium games, not making purchases has no major detriment to the playability. Keep up the good work EA!' ,

      'Tokens take too long to refill. Level up gives a few coins, why not a token refill? Tournament champion gets 4 tokens. 7 tokens for a day? Cheapskates! When do you want us to play, every 5 days? So cheap in giving prizes, guessing you want us to buy eh? I\'ll give myself a few weeks playing this game and am out. No daily prize wheel, just a daily "less than 20 coins" reward. Sooooooo cheap!',
       'Classic UNO with a couple of modern twists and turns. I have never spent any real money in a game and I don\'t ever plan to, but here you also don\'t really need to. I\'ve won many tournaments and got really far in the game without buying anything. You get extra coins by winning and completing daily tasks, as well as watching ads. But you\'re not forced to watch them. It\'s not just about luck. You have to play smart to win, just like any other card game. I love it.',
       'Great game in the graphics department however, I agree with other consumers when they say the special abilities you can obtain by playing this game ruins it. Simple is best and this uno app is anything but. Sometimes when I log in, the tokens don\'t even recharge overnight and I have to wait a few more hours before I play three free rounds of uno before you have to pay for more tokens. Very hit and miss app.',
       'Okay, this is actually a decent game HOWEVER unless you buy your way through its almost impossible to win tournaments.  They shouldn\'t be putting people in the "club" and level 100+ with people who are like level 10 and not in this "club" it makes it almost impossible for them to win unless they\'re INSANELY lucky.  People with cheats can turn you from being at uno and winning, to being in last place in seconds and it honestly just kills the enjoyment of the game',
       'Greatest game ever~~¤mean it.  The Updated game even better.  Need to be easier to play with Friends that you JUST made ~~maybe REPLAY!!!  😬 😲 😠 😐 😭  Friends where are you? Great for tablets.   I am UNO happy . Happy New years  .Oh don\'t terminate the game unless you just have to, I well try finding something other to do. Nothing Good ever lasts anyway.   Thanks for reading.  UNO POWER.',
       'Awesome game, definitely feels like I\'m playing the UNO card game. However, the little bit of energy you have is a killjoy. Especially since matches are short because it\'s timed and most of the time, there\'s no real winner. I don\'t mind the energy so much as I mind the games being cut short and instead the winner is decided by a point system.' ,

      'I really enjoy this game, and I can put up with the ads. What I tire of are the extra prizes and this coin currency. What happened? Why do we suddenly need coins? And a 1500 coin limit? You give me a daily prize, not even sure for what, yet those two meaningless coins just vanish. Go back to the old days. Get rid of all the helper tools. Lose the coins. You\'re better than that.',
       'The game itself is mostly fine. The words they allow are mitigated by removing potential "trigger words" which happen to be in every dictionary but not in the game, because it might offend someone. So, when you have letters to play a word, it sometimes isn\'t accepted because of their ignorance of the English language. Simply add a control for users to see or not see words played by competitors. Or to play with certain words turned on or off. However, words with friends two seems to believe in word control as a means of deterrence. We\'ve seen how well gun control works in Chicago and how well prohibition worked, so clearly it\'s the most effective method...... (heavy sarcasm)',
       'The game doesn\'t always put my games when it\'s my turn in the right spot.  It looks like it\'s my opponent\'s turn, when it\'s mine.  Also games don\'t show up on the day they play.  I play everyday so my turn games should not be from 4-5 days before .  Sometimes I\'ll get off the game because I have no more to play and check back 10 minutes later and my games say they have been there for hours.  Please fix.  Otherwise the game is good and the lightning round is fun.',
       'Love the game but this latest version is nowhere near as nice.  It won\'t rotate onto landscape so must play in portrait which is not my preferred hold.  I can handle the ads...except for the ones which don\'t come with an \'x\' to take them away. This means clicking in and out of them until the picture and the x appears to allow going back to the game. This takes time I don\'t have if I\'m trying to play before work or during smoko.  The original was doing much better than this and was more user friendly.  And with free swaps, hints and game play area it is getting further from its roots all the time.  I am however enjoying the Beat The Masters so it got something right',
       'I loved WWF Classic, and I didn\'t like Words 2.  It seemed like I couldn\'t make plays on Classic, games were freezing up.  , Out of desperation to play, I tried Words 2 another turn.   What I don\'t like are the blasted ads, especially the ones sending me too intstall more games.  I don\'t like the anemic \'ink\'. It\'s too pale, especially the green. I think that is the main reason I didn\'t like it at first, and still don\'t.  The only thing I truly love about this game, is the lightening games and beat the Masters.   My cat loves this game too.',
       'This morning, the game crashes after every word played - it\'s happened about 10 times already. What\'s happened since I played last night. This is a fun game, but frustrating because there\'s always some kind of problem.  Edited: now it doesn\'t crash, but I get no notifications that a game is waiting for me to play a word. Why is this so difficult? Edited 2/13: still no notifications that it\'s my turn and no notifications of messages from other players.  This game is NEVER trouble free.' ,

      'I had this game a long time ago and it is one of the best games out there. It hasent changed since when I usted to have it it would be nice to get some new maps or bikes and maybe change the layout of the menu. And maybe even a multipler more where u play with other people/friends and just free ride or challenge to see who can get more points. Other then that it is a crazy fun and addictive game.',
       'Awesome!!!! It\'s an awesome  game.......But(there\'s always a \'but\' coming from me ;-) )......You should work on the reality glitches. Like when you start, in the first levels(the docks)...You move and the bike rolls down but when you move up the next slope it doesnt....You should work on that. One more thing......You should not keep all levels payed. You should keep it like, if you beat a certain record or you finish the course faster than the time given already. Otherwise, HATS OFF TO YOU ILLUSION LABS...GREAT WORK!!!',
       'LMAO, how pathetic. Not even possible to control this garbage.  It is nice to see that your level of dedication matches the skateboard version of the game though, along with the PC version, and that you continue to abandon your paid software, you thieves.',
       'I liked the game a lot. The graphics are great and the tricks are to I loved every thing about. But the one thing I do not like is that ther is no free ride. I think it would be better if ther were skate parks and stuff like that to ride on.     😀💚GREAT GAME💚😀',
       'Them controls tho....ew When I do a tail whip, It just slowly make its way back but not until I land and crash and sometimes it stays in the front and never comes back like how am I supposed to get 1.5m pts with this crap? Not enough time in the air with makes it kinda not obvious. This game sucks ass. And why does the camera angle goes off in the sky and everywhere all the time like wtf? Can\'t make a smooth game guys? God damn this game makes me so fckng mad!!!',
       'I really enjoyed this game till now... I completed all the challenges on docks and have 200 adrenaline but haven\'t unlocked next map!?! I went online and researched it and you apparently need 210 adrenaline but there is no way to get it so you have to burly full game!!! This is a money scam' ,

      'It\'s a best game on playstore!!! I play it lot of.. and it\'s my favourite game.. but one problem is that when i start multiplayer match it says sercer not found or server overloaded. But it doesent matter for much. I give all 5 star for best graphics, bedt controls, and also bestest weapons. I love this game. Thank you gameloft. We expect that you will keep developing games like modern combat. I am waiting anxiously for next series. Thank you.',
       'I had previously given this game a 1 star but for this update I\'m blown away by the network rectification aspect. The game runs butter smooth even after post FUP data speeds. The game is currently saturated with lvl 140 players with all the prestige weapons, so I\'d request you to bring about a balanced match making in the PvP based on their matching levels and introduce some welcome benefits for the returning players',
       'This probably the best FPS game in the Play Store. Graphics, animations, music, voice actings everything in this game are awesome. 😊  The game runs in my phone in full 60 fps on Ultra-high settings. But sometimes it crashes without any reason and when I run the game again, it starts to verify game data. My phone is not rooted and I do believe the problem is not in my phone, it\'s a bug in the game. 😕  Overall, it\'s a great game. ☺️  Peace out. 🤘',
       'This game is awesome.  But plzzzz ban clone paragon  first plzz plzz plzz.  Every match i see 2 or three paragon...  And mc5 is best game so far... One more thing this game turn into pay to win i think so plzzz reduce  the pay to win system and in match give 40 to 50 credit 10 credit is very lowest credit  to unlock items.... So plzzzz ban paragon first and give extra free credit  resources to earn in multilayer match....',
       'Fantastic game! It\'s by Gameloft so it\'s bound to be a good phone game. It\'s not unfair, but you do have to have some skill. It doesn\'t hold your hand but it\'s not hard to learn the controls. Despite the fact that you\'re also playing against people who are on their computers as well, it\'s definitely not unfair. One request: maybe add more options for your killstreaks. I would love to have my drone and turret on the same killstreak for my sniper class but I\'m stuck with recon instead. Still love it tho :)',
       'Played one time, loved it. But now when I open it again, its stuck on "loading player profile" screen. I\'m pretty sure its not a mobile phone problem, either its a server issue or a bug.  Edited: I got past the loading screen, it takes simple procedures like \'clear cache\' and cellphone reboot. But you\'ll have to do these everytime you want to play so I\'m uninstalling for now. Hope its fixed soon.' ,

      'sweet but damn loosin up the machines they don\'t hit often enough. I can say when they do they hit pretty big so I guess its a toss up. I will like to see maybe some coin offers for .99cents lowest ive seen is starting at $5',
       'I downloaded this last night at work thinking it give me something to do .. Well it did for a short while and then when I made a purchase it froze up on me and now is saying "error encountered. Please reload app" i have numerous times and its stuck on loading lobby... I\'m a little irritated as to spending money on something that doesn\'t even open. At first I gave 5 stars now if I could give 0 I would.',
       'Unless the game developers go and look at my history from today, this happened about 30-40 min ago. It said I I won u get my new total well over 150,000 the game froze and I got nothing. This is unreal. I wanted to put - stars but that is available.',
       'I played thhis game in Vegas and I was happy to see that it was availablee to play here in this free application.  It is fun to play, I only wish the dollar amounts were closer to what you would be playing in Vegas. for instance, I played this game on the penny slots while in Vegas. My minimum bid was 30 cents.  In this game you are able bet a minumum of about 30k which for me is very unrealistic but on tthe other hand it is all play money right, so makes it fun to play!',
       'I enjoy playing this game almost as fun as the real games. One of my favorites until the update in June now it look like a generic version, like a childish game. I loved the tournament\'s , it was removed. The game take forever to load.  I will play out my coins and delete app not fun amymore.',
       'Love thesr games.   I get good payoffs.   My problem is that recently it has been turning off by itself.  Now it won\'t let me pick a game from the lobby before it turns off.  I have lost several free spins, I lost a large win and I can\'t get those back.' ,

      'Such a bad game. Nekki never gets enough of money so they show ads nearly after every fight. You can\'t earn gems from watching videos as it\'s never available. Tapjoy offers have been completed, but never awarded. All the weapons gets worser as you level up. Nekki wants you to BUY the good weapons. Bad game. Shadow fight 3 is worser than this one.',
       'Challenges ruin the experience. Mandatory in order to progress and level up. Some challenges are just ridiculous, and frustrating when you\'re given five tries and having to watch a thirty second ad to get one back every time, even if you make a simple mistake. Other than that it\'s good.',
       'The AI spam SO much! All they do is throw a suriken at you till you die. They won\'t even let you get up! 2 hits and I die yet I hit them like 10 times! There should be unlimited energy who wants to spend $20 for unlimited energy. Plus the controls are trash.',
       'Let me just say I don\'t mind a challenge. But the first boss fight is ridicoulous. You need to be lvl 7 to do anything. I would not have a problem with that but you have to farm survival mode to get lvl 7. No problem right well no there is a problem you get 2 xp for beating survival 2!!!!! And you need 400 this is freaking ridicoulous. Plus when you get lvl 7 he is like a regular oppenent. The difference between 1 lvl should not be this high',
       'As much as I like this game, the final boss is unnecessarily difficult. Seriously, what were you thinking when you came up with it? And the game crashes more than I\'d like. But the game is really well done! Flaws and all, it worked out well. Nicely done.',
       'It\'s a great game, I must admit. But why are you so slow in adding newer features to the game?  There\'s only one enchantment - Tempest rage in the mythical recipe, which was added about 6-7 updates ago. What about the other three?  Also there is only charge as powers in clan raid, NO ELIXIR, NO HORN, some other icons in the player\'s about section - ALL SAY - "UNDER DEVELOPMENT"!

      'ļnstaII \'VEARN\' App Enterr (ALEN) to Start Earning So far so good.Fun way to get money. Won\'t make you rich but the extra cash is helpful. It\'s also the best exchange rate on points. VEarn points equals vac instead of like some of the others where it takes McEarn points to reach mc etc...Also, ļnstaII \'TOYOPAY\' App Enterr (KRSA) very reliable in paying you when you redeem to Toyopay. You can choose assorted giftcards as payment or transfer to WaIet for cash. Your choice. I love these guys thanks for addingsome fun to my day.',
       'Please read this EA. PLAYING WITH THE SILVER PLAYER IN SEASON VS. MY ELITE PLAYERS ARE VERY UNUSUAL THAT ALL THE SHOTS OF SILVER PLAYER\'S GO IN AND ALL MIND IN +20 ARE NOW WOW VERY NICE GAME EA. Also When playing the auction menu when I did not Win the auction. It supposed to give me back my money coin but it did not happen. It\'s an error on your part so GIVE ME BACK MY COINS PLEASE. Would love to buy some CASH BUT THE FACT HOW YOUR GAME IS MADE MY MIND CHANGE!!!',
       'Today all star promo came and honestly it is fun new playes, live events nd all. New platinum players are there that looks very powerful and amazing. The thing is i have done my all daily objectives but still i am not able to get my daily objective token and the nba cash. This happened only today so plzz fix this.',
       'Yo ea the wait for the all star promo better be good cuz if not im legit breaking my phone and im never even saying the two words nba live ever again. Im being serious ea. You guys are literally emptying our pockets and your making it unfair for people who are saving money or cant afford. Fix your game please.',
       'U guys simply tell Ur employees to play game if u want to make money just by selling cash. U can\'t give one token in NBA royalty set. I wasted more than 1000 cash for getting one last token. If u can\'t make it friendly for players who wanna play for fun then Ur game sucks',
       'Dont play the nba royalty event. The developer of this event is cheater. I dont know what is criteria the way of playing this event. I shot the ball without guarding and it missed. You cannot steal of course even if guard your opponent and if your opponent miss the shot they got rebound. I know it is hard to win because the prize is not just the prize. but if you win the the nba royalty they will give you same reward which is you got already. Crazy. You making your player fool.' ,

      'I really like this game but often when I go to play it, the character only jump in one direction and you cannot control it\'s movement at all.  This is very frustrating and usually I have to wait a while before I can come back and the character can be controlled by tilting again.  Thank you for your help in solving this problem.',
       'For after you die they ask if you wanna watch an ad to ressurect but then if u decline you still are forced to watch an ad. Bad logic this game. Too many ads. Plz fix',
       'I\'ve had the game for a long time now and I\'ve never experienced any problems, although I normally play with WiFi off so that I don\'t get ads after every death',
       'Needs more of a story line to it but overall I personally think that it\'s a good game',
       'Simple, casual, but needs cloud save for collections and stats',
       'I couldn\'t even get into the app no matter what I did even installing it again.' ,

      'This is the most addictive flight simulator I have ever played. The game is fairly easy to progress through without having to spend any money. If I had to find one fault it would be that you can\'t reverse when on a runway which means some times you have no option but to crash your plane as there is very little room to turn around.',
       'So I love the app but in free mode it will let you play.missions.. In a couple of the missions I have noticed it has given me 200 passengers to bring to a airplane boat (forgot what its called) and you cannot land a plane big enough for 200 passengers on it! No room to land without the wing getting clipped off by the tower and no place to take off from it! Other than that it is an awesome game',
       'A really good game to play if your board and have nothing to do. Its proberly one of the best flight simulators on mobile devices ive ever played. The graphics are acctually really good for a mobile game that runs smoothly. The controles can somtimes be wonky but youll get used to it. I love to play this game i really enjoy. The best thing about it is that, its FREE! Good job \'fun games for free\' 👏👌🖒☺',
       'Was able to start playing right away because of the level of simplicity and yet you have to learn so you can challenge yourself in the more advanced campaigns that soon come up. The game will leave you finding out that a couple of hours has passed in a blink of an eye because of the fun you\'re having. I really just started the game so I will come back and update this in a few months as I advance in the game.',
       'I\'ve been losing sleep for days now playing this incredible game. Hahaha! Great graphics, smooth controls, realistic sounds, and easy-to-navigate interface. It doesn\'t force users to pay real money to fully enjoy and access the game. I wish the game offers a first-person mode where you get to play inside the cockpit and navigate the aircraft. That would be so much extra fun! Hats off to the team behind the game\'s development! :)',
       'Pretty cool app. I\'d like it more the planes/jets could be personalized with personal/or existing airline company names and if you could play commercial type flying modes. All without having to level up or earn money or pay real money for. Like a free fly mode. Oh,oh... and that there was real life situations that happen as a result of no fly zones and stuff. Otherwise it\'s pretty cool so far.' ,

      'This game is very nice and the best game I have ever played. If you have a chance to download this game dont let this chance to pass by. I prefer you to download this game. In this game you have a small place to decorate but there is more place which you have to buy. There is a guide in this game called Ernie who has the most beautiful town ever. You can visit his town any time you like and also make friends with anyone else. Me and my all sisters ( I dont have a brother )play this all day long and have much fun. This is the best game ever.',
       'The VERY best game EVER..so fast to level up... Never boring.. Always SO much to do!!! ... it NEVER asks 4 money !!!!!!   NO pop ups or commercials. !!!. . the inventors are genius... i Love this game..  thank you for making this game.. Graphics are Amazing!!!   Best farming game ...Bonus Zoo !!!...and breed ur animals ADORABLE BABIES.. with a splash of Cityville  ..Gold digging..making ingots to use...  So many optional tournaments if u want to win more money n prizes in the Regattas... Township friends make it SO much easier n fast 4 everyone  .. and so much more You just HAVE TO Try TOWNSHIP ❣💞',
       'RSYFJH Great game very addictive, and I don\'t know if I just found the right Co-op or what but the team work on this game is amazing. I love my little town although, 😒 you need to be able to expand faster! I have NO ROOM for any more buildings, and they want me to expand my population so I can add more buildings. Thats\'s kind of ridiculous. That\'s the only bad thing I have to say about this game.',
       'I love this game. Amazing sound effects, graphics. You guys did a great job that\'s for sure! But still couldn\'t give it a five star because of the lastest update. The entire screen goes black after playing the game for 5-6 minutes. That\'s pretty irritating not to mention how much slower the phone gets as well. Didn\'t have these issues with the last update. Fix it please!',
       'This game is sooooo addictive,  it\'s like 4get cooking,  cleaning once you start it\'s hard to stop lol.  Lots of fun races,  prizes,  co-ops to help each other & make friends and have a great time.  But be forwarned this game can cause you to lose track of time.  Oh I will play for couple hours & next thing you know it\'s 1 am lol.  Hmmm few more mins bam it\'s 4 am.',
       'I love this game! It is very addicting. The details and graphics are outstanding. The only thing I don\'t like is how long  it takes to accumulate coins and cash, the videos to earn coins and cash are glitchy most of the time and don\'t work. The factories are expensive once you get to higher levels and are hard to buy due to how many coins it cost. Overall, this is one of my favorite games hands down!' ,

      'So far the best, mostly free, slot game yet. I think a dollar for only one scratch ticket is a bit pricey I mean come on. It\'s only a game. This day and age. More for less, brings more, than less. I\'m not paying a real $1.00 for just 1 game coins scratcher. Otherwise far as for fun. Huuuge is the casino\'s and Slot\'s you should be playing. Definitely a boredom killer.',
       'I\'ve seen some pretty bad paywalls in games, it\'s to be expected...but this game takes it to a whole new level. First 10 minutes playing you will win every other spin, enter bonus games every couple of spins, and win win win..then the paywall. The final 100 plus spins netted me about 5 wins that at least broke even and absolutely 0 bonus spins or bonus games. Definitely not going to pay real money for a game that\'s this tight. Don\'t waste your time. Lots of other slot games that are balanced',
       'Good game when it\'s not crashing. Had it crash 6 times in 15 minutes. Huge payouts during bonus spins. Sitting on 85 Billion that I can spend due to stability issues. Fix this and I will rate the game higher. Playing on Galaxy S 8+.',
       'Awesome game... just like being in a REAL casino.  Every now and then the game will cut out. I\'m hoping it\'s just my Wifi service? ? :\'-/',

      'I loved the game gold coin,however when my winnings  got high,  you took the game away. I played some other games that sucked up most of my winnings, thennnnnn I had gotten excited  to see that I could play 50 free spins  of the game I loved so much, golden coin.  And lost the spins on that as well. A rating  of 5 for sure if I could get  the game back . For now a 2 and possibly  delete this game for good. Thank you for your time. 🤐',
       'Love playing, but can\'t play long on the pathetic payouts. Have to build up credits over days and weeks to be able to play! If we got more jackpots on the free coins we could play longer. Buying coins is much too expensive compared to other slot games.',
       'Please can you let me win a big jackpot   I ask you nicely I never win big I love this game it keeps me busy for hours. It helps me not to go to a real casino and waste my money on them instead I sit at home and play this. Cool game',
       'The game is rigged to lose.  Don\'t buy chips because once you do you always lose so that you can keep buying more and more.  Customer service is nonexistent and doesn\'t care about any issues with the game and does not reimburse you for any issues the game may have caused.  They only care about the bottom line and not about costumers or their loyalty',
       'Was fun until update and now I can\'t get app to open or play.  Keeps giving me error messages.  Don\'t see option to uninstall update, guess next step is to uninstall period.  Which sucks because I worked to build back zip once game stopped paying out even w the free spins. Would rate higher if worked',

      'I mean the game in itself is......alright  it could be a lot better.  I think the controls are rubbish and I understand it\'s meant to be "skillfull" but thats harder than skillfull, you can\'t even see where the circle is, this also adds to the game being bad. Having said all this you have also added rubbish music..... like you could have put something decent on. I get even more of an urge to uninstall the game every time I play it. Overall I definitely do NOT recommend this game. Game developers I hope you read this as it will probably help you to make the game better. I understand it would take a while but I don\'t care. If any of the game developers want to feedback on my feedback you are welcome to.Thank you.',

      'Excellent game! I have no doubt that the game is one of the most perfect games. Everything but one thing. I just ran one race that comes with the actualization and I won around 5k, te first upgrade for the camaro Nascar costs around 130k does that even make sense. In the real life if you spend that money to make a competitive car to win that money... I hope you get my meaning',
       'Good game, good graphics,good sound. I like that it is on going, not like some similar games. I found it fairly easy to get used too. Plenty of choices and cars. I like that you are not constantly forced to spend real money in order to progress. That is a big plus for us game players. Well done all at EA, you have a real winner with this game. I personally am loving playing this game. Update, I have been playing for a few days now, the only drawback I have noticed is, the game takes up a lot of space on my device. Having said that, its so good its worth it. As previously, well done all at EA.',
       'This game is brilliant. Have been playing it for ages. However the updates are messing with previous games, especially NASCAR I\'ve been playing previous events but with update they\'ve gone and replaced by new ones, I\'ve been working towards cars etc....all gone. Slightly annoying guys. Keep up with the good work etc but leave the previous ones alone please.',
       'Please, slow down with new cars and give us some time o get old ones. Also, add more classic F1 tracks, like Monte Carlo, Hungaroring, Sao Paolo, Adelaide, Magny Court, San Marino, etc. Or some famous rally tracks.. Think about it. Everything else is awasome. I played this game more than 4 years, and I can only give you 5 stars, but you deserve more than 5.',
       'I\'m a player of RR since 2013 Well, almost the fifth time and more that I rate and write comments and the game still wants me to rate it, even if I paid. I put 3 stars because of the buy to win, and the repetitive map. Still best simulation game.',
       'Update is OK but feels like the load time before and after a race are much longer. I thought the cars would be cheaper to buy too, just a rumour??? Still far too much gold is needed and very little offered. Surely fans would want to able to own and race all the cars, many are beyond reach and makes me actually dislike the car company!!! Better ai, cheaper cars, faster load times, maybe more touring cars also.' ,

      'This is basically a golf clash rip off.  Very bad mechanics and view points.  You cant spin the camera angle which makes for very awkward shots and also makes it so you cant do a full swing when shooting from left to or right to left because you run out of screen.  Oh and wind adjustment in a putt-putt game is just stupid, not to mention the wind affects are very buggy.  This game sucked.',
       'Game is not right. People with lower balls and clubs can shoot further then higher ones? A lot of glitches. Ball guide lines show that you clear obstacles and when you take the shot, you hit the obstacle. When fixed, might rate better.',
       'It\'s good.. but they really try and rake you over the coals... everything is waaaayyyy overpriced and theres obviously a huge emphasis on pay to play..  However... the actual gameplay is straightforward, collect gems and get the ball in the hole before your opponent. It\'s fun for about 20 minutes a day. And the freebies could be a little better, but again I get the emphasis on the pay to play/be competitive. Overall great game mechanics and solid game play. Definitely give it a try if you have half am hour or so to kill.',
       'Great game, but people and game cheats. If you have more gems, the lower amount wins? Fix this please. I\'m tired of losing and tired of getting knocked off the course or my gems stolen',
       'Actually enjoy but I keep getting shut off when I\'m playing! I\'m very disappointed with how the coins disappear when in the middle of a game. I\'ve been cheated out thousands of coins when I was on my winning shot too. So very uncool.',
       'It always seems that luck favors your opponent and gold is extremely hard to come by,  It would be nice if they gave you gold rewards for achievements but that\'s where their money grab is. Some courses have bugs in it\'s extremely frustrating, Win or lose money always seems to be pretty tight.' ,

      'Amazing! Great fix. Epic simulator. Awesome. Please add some more Chevrolet Corvette C6 Z06 (rivals Dodge Viper). And if possible, a BMW M5 (the 2005 version which has a 5L V10 engine and is also used as a drift machine). Maybe a Rolls Royce Silver Shadow 2 (it\'s a classic Roller from the \'70s and I have seen one as a one-off drift machine). Great addition of new track sections in multiplayer. Needs more than just paint customization. It needs stuff like adding very big wings and bodykits. Maybe even custom vinyls.',
       'It\'s still lacking the promised customization (patiently waiting for it), but the game as it is right now is probably the best drifting game in the entire Playstore. The latest update seems to have made the game much smoother compared to previous updates as well, and it seems to have reduced the battery consumption a bit.',
       'EVERY TIME I CLICK ON A AD TO COMPLETE A OFFER IT GOES TO THE LOADING SCREEN AND FREEZES. Been playing this game a few years now I can tell you this is the best damn drifting game I\'ve ever played.Anyone else trying to make a good drift game has to try and make things  like Car X but can\'t as far as I\'ve seen.Great game and graphics.',
       'Asides from the two vehicles added, great recovery, great fixer upper. I hate to disappoint you, but Don\'t get emotionally hurt or ban a customer because of your mistakes. Accept them as you proceed. I don\'t need to sugarcoat anything. Now discontinue your high priced charges for any portion of this application. Good job again...',
       'After the recent update the tracks started to glitch n now you update it again and the game doesn\'t even show up after loading just music and a blank screen with bock round showing. I really loved this game at first until the updates and the all the problems and now I can\'t even play it. Come on guys get it together already I thought updates were to make things better not turn it to complete trash',
       'Best drifting/racing game on the market at the moment. Fantastic graphics, really good gameplay and vehicle physics. Although the cars aren\'t licensed, they do look very good. Interior detail of the cars is also immensely good, especially for a mobile game. 5/5 for sure.' ,

      'If there is anything that would make me quit playing this game, it would be ads. I don\'t mind ads but ads are just way too much and take away the fun of this game.  Apart from that game also freezes sometimes and there are some glitches too.',
       'Really fun game. Lots of levels. Really like tournament and duels. I feel like there\'s some cheating in the tournaments. When I watch the videos some people seem to not be touching the ground. That\'s pretty lame. Other than that great game',
       'That\'s crazy you allow hackers to have the highest score and also show the video. Say that person isn\'t cheating and I\'ll show you a video where he shows how he does it. A-hole.',
       'Have a problem touching the multi-tasking button Wichita spawn commercials while I\'m racing. And it\'s my favorite game. Thanks',

      'this game is so simple but yet so challenging. some levels seem impossible but the great thing is you can still advance as long as you have enough points. very well done. hats off to the designer. the physics are coded perfect as well for gravity friction inertia and sometimes extra bounce..  love it. can only handle it in bursts of play because it works your brain so intensely. havent used the hints either though. if you dont keep coming back to play this then you probably arent a very interesting person and spend too much time diddling your privates',
       'A good sign of high intelligence would be to not pay for this.   On a tablet with a pen,  this probably works a little better but on a phone with 1 minute ads,   it\'s really frustrating.   Basically,  you find a solution and have to repeat it 30 times until the dull and unrealistic physics of this program finally accept it.',
       'I introduced this game to my 8 year old and my husband. We are all hooked! I am fascinated by the concept and simple yet brilliant design. The forced 30 second ads that another reviewer mentioned are only if you want a hint. The between-round ads are short and intermittent.',
       'Calling this a physics game is a joke. Sure, it has a physics engine that handles things like acceleration, "mass" and magnetism... But it\'s really just a very limited drawing game. Want to draw a ramp because it would lead to the most elegant solution? Sorry, can\'t... Because your "pencil" is too thick and the ball just hits the base of the ramp and bounces off. Know a simple solution? Well, have fun drawing it fifteen times while you get the exact dimensions needed in a very inexact system. I really think there are far better games to practice problem solving that don\'t get in your way as much as this one.',
       'The ads suck horribly if you don\'t buy it! But it is worth the dollar. Drawing with your finger is not very precise, but more about timing and placement.  So be prepared to reset, and try again numerous times, especially if you are going for a 3 star complete.  Great game!',
       'LOVE this game!! Literally, I don\'t think I can explain it. Just play it, and see for yourself :D    If you like figuring stuff & puzzles out, this is totally for you! And also, it\'s just so satisfying to watch. I personally play lots of the puzzles over & over again, just to see the graphics, how all the objects fly and move 😜' ,

      'Lemme just say ketchapp your games are soooo good!! And addictive including this one it\'s fun and ever since the first play I\'ve been hooked there are barely any adds and the graphics are phenomenal. I play it all the time plz don\'t change this, if u do your going to loose my five stars🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟.',
       'Most of my apps are from Ketchapp. Their creativity and style of games have just been wanting me to download more and more! Right now, Ketchapp is one of my most favourite game groups ever! Keep making more! I don\'t have any improvements, which means that their games are top notch!',
       'Patheitc. Being such a fast paced game you cannot have the blocks starting to move a split second before you\'re going to pass it. Makes the game pretty impossible from the first level. For something that was supposed to be fun, is more frustrating. You need severe luck on your side to get a win. Recommended do not download',
       'Its a good concept, but you need to update it, and make sure the blocks no longer move. Right now, it is by far the most luck based skill game. It is impossible to dodge the moving blocks, so if they are to move, they should move much slower',
       'This game can be a fun one but it keeps moving slow when I roll over about 5 or more of the yellow arrows and it\'s distracting. Idk if the game is new but could you review this please. Only one \'kind\' of obstacle is there. The black boxes. Otherwise good game. 😊',
       'I think it is a great way for amiee to get design for her Xbox 360 and help her get over with her anger with her sister and to help her to figure out what\'s the matter but what is the most important thing is to be a fantastic family together but why are we so lonely.... Well i think it is a great opportunity to make new friends to life' ,

      'Probably the best mobile game I\'ve ever played! Its super fun, but thats not what makes it the best game... it is one of the least gold/gem hungry games ive played. You dont need to spend money to have fun. They let you watch a ton of ads for gems, which is cool. But I will say when do buy gems you dont get a lot of gems for your dollar!',
       'I love the game so far. I\'m not too far in it yet, but I\'m gonna be playing for a while. The one big issue I have with it, is that it is such a battery hog. It pulls so much power that my phone starts to get ridiculously hot and I can burn through a chunk of my battery within 10 minutes of play time',
       'This game gets 1 star for the following reasons, 1. It takes up a huge amount of storage on my phone, 2. It takes forever to load, 3. It takes forever to close, 4. It sucks the life out of the battery, 5. It takes FOREVER  to get items needed to unlock or upgrade things. I swear it\'s like the game knows what items you\'re looking for (weather in the world market or benches etc.) and keeps it from you. But sure thing if you\'re not looking for something it\'ll pop up VERY frequently.',
       'Used to be better. If you\'re new to the game, you will love it. If you\'ve been playing longer, your aware of the negative changes. It used to be a 5 star game. but Recent upgrades push "old time players" toward requiring to purchase (with real money) or limited add watching to obtain diamonds in order to progress. So if you\'re new, take your time and enjoy! Also, no added value to purchasing VIP. Building and upgrading does go a little faster, but by the time you get past the basics, what you need is hard to find or get (without diamonds) to progress. So again, take your time and enjoy if you\'re just starting. 😁',
       'It\'s OK... But the reviews that say you don\'t need to spend money are lying. I have fixed every bench in town for a week and found no cement - but you can buy it for 96 gems. Yea right. Pay to play as always... Also its a bit of a grind game, doing the same things over and over which just get a bit more expensive the more times you do it. Its OK to waste 20mins on but I won\'t be keeping it that long.',
       'Very addicting game! looking forward to new updates and other things to do! I understand why now that i don\'t get diamonds like I use to. thank you for reaching out to me and I understand they are trying to keep fair game play! I would recommend this to anyone, it does not get boring like other simulation games' ,

      'Should be an option to lock targeting  and then fire, many shots were messed up from lifting my fingure at a very slight angle.  Also check points should last longer than once. Making one mistake at lvl 190+ and then having to go back to zero was so frustrating it was the main reason i uninstalled.  Terrible shame honestly, the game could have been really fun and is an original idea',
       'Good simple nd great stress buster but at higher levels there is glitch. I got to lvl 570+ and game hangs  and way too slow . Even number on cell exceeds its size.  I scored in advanced part. Hope developers do something about it',
       'Its a really great game and I really recommend it! The only problems I had was the controls are a little weird and there a little bit of too much ads but I dont mind it but I\'d rather you fix it! Thanks for making me happy! ♡',
       'Its a great game i love it. The only problem would be that the speed X2 sign covers how many balls i have left and i hate that maybe try placing that top right hand corner instead of bottom right. I also hate that it only speed up X2 and not anymore but i can live without it',
       'Game is fun and addictive. Ads are horrendous. Can\'t skip/exit and happen all the time. Edit: if you have data and WiFi access disabled, when you back out of ads the screen goes black and won\'t let you play',
       'Really good game to sit and relax but would be good if the balls could go faster than 2x speed. If you have high points then it takes a while for every turn to watch them bounce around.' ,

      'The mini golf is great! I\'ve had a ton of fun playing and you don\'t need the in app purchases to win as long as you\'re meticulous with your shots. The ads are a necessary evil I guess. My only big complaint is that lining up shots with the button controlls. They need to have some sort of sensitivity changer so that shots can be fine tuned. All in all though, great game! Good job.',
       'Worst challenges ever, setup terribly to make it harder to win, always end up in a corner or another bad angle. Ball speed is so touchy, the smallest amount makes it from "to slow" to "over shot", really needs to have better increments.. usually it takes a while for me to dislike a game but this one had me agrivated pretty quick.',
       'I think the game was terrible.  When you take a shot on target it rebounded up and missed the whole  Also I think they could in prove by making the controls better',
       'Stupid rule set. I got a birdie and so did the other player, yet they won and I lost. Makes no sense, fix your game',
       'Well, I can\'t really say.  I can\'t open it on my Nook. It keeps crashing.',
       'This is really good game and I would recommend getting it the only bad thing about it is that it tends to be very slow on trying to turn the controls when you want to point the ball a different direction' ,

       'Used to be a fun game but unfortunately it no longer works. Game has you waste your coins on quests which you complete and then you receive no reward for some reason. You\'re supposed to get free coins but about half the time you don\'t actually get it after you click the button. I wasted 90 coins and complete a quest and then I received nothing but it clearly thinks I completed the quest because I need to pay another 90 coins to get a new Quest. This is happen like half the time! Sometimes I get no XP for some reason. I don\'t know what happened to this game',
       'What is this???? After every 1 or 2 game when the main menu comes I touch screen just frozes I can\'t even touch any button. Neither I can play nor I can go to shop it\'s nothing I can do but just to quit the game. My phone is Samsung S6  Pls do something it\'s really irritating',
       'This is a nice idea for a game but needs a lot of work. First of i couldn\'t even understand how the game works. Always saying "connection is slow" every damn time. Controls? Terrible. Before i even learn how to move i get eaten. Please look into these and you might have a good game there.',
       'fix the laaags please. I have high speed internet but still facing lags. I spent a lot in this game and don\'t want to loose it. Still lagging :(. It works with only high speed internet. Can\'t play with the data packages only strong wifi.  You didn\'t fix this in the new edition of the game and the rush mode is not working. The new party is sucks big time. Fix fix fix',
       'Over all great game, but there\'s just one problem. The problem is that when you get huge (35k mass or higher) it tends to lag and freezes then eventually the app crashes please fix it really annoying .. Edit : There seems to be a bug in the controls shooting food will split tf' ,

      'I really enjoyed this game but same problem as someone else since you have updated it it just says waiting for WiFi. I had problems when you updated it before and in the end had a new phone started again and now this problem. Why does problems happen when you do and update. I have got to a good level again and I really don\'t want to start again. It\'s a shame as I really think this is or was the best game I\'ve played.  Please sort it',
       'I\'m addicted to this game.  You don\'t have to spend money to enjoy it either.  Illustrated beautifully and I love the fact items move around plus also have different modes to keep you intrigued. I only find it frustrating not having enough energy to keep seeking',
       'Very good game and beautifully designed. Nice combination of seeking games and other puzzles and great looking locations. Would give a 5 rating but for 2 things; 1. Happy to spend a bit of cash now and then, but being constantly spammed to buy stuff spoils the game ( and makes me reluctant to part with my cash) 2. Really annoying to have to explore locations multiple times (up to 20 times) to get it into the right "mode". There are tools to do this, but they can\'t be targeted so are almost completely useless.',
       'Really like this game, although some parts are not made very clear. I don\'t understand parts of it, but I\'m getting there. And it\'s a but clunky but maybe that\'s because I\'m on my tablet. As with all games, not enough, or big enough, rewards!',
       'Fun diversionary challenge. Too bad you are tethered by the constant request(offers) to spend your money. Seems like the winnings you work for during the game amount to almost nothing. Could qualify for a great rating if this were handled differently.',

      'Developers, please read.  First, this is a fun game and I enjoy its play style. It\'s reminiscent of TV shows like Battles Bots and game series\' like Bot Arena.   Second, I would like to suggest giving players the ability to add, delete, and move weapon, utility, and wheel anchors. In the same way players can currently add enhancements to parts and chassis\'s and move around stickers.   Third, It would be appreciated if Quick Play Super Boxes replaced Regular Boxes after all shipment slots are full. It would provide a greater incentive to keep playing Quick Play beyond just Winning Streak Crown Rewards.  I\'m offering these suggestions because I really enjoy this game and would like to see it become a more fulfilling and personalized experience.  Thank you,',
       'I absolutely love this game. I spend a lot of time on it! It\'s fairly balanced between players who play for free and those who purchase gems to give their bots better stats. You can easily rank up without paying a dime. I did for so long, until I kept hoarding pieces and didn\'t want to sell. I began to use gems instead of coins.',
       'Hi there Admin.  The cash purchased Super Giant Box has just crushed on me while I was opening it. I think much of its content is still out there instead on my account.  Would you be so kind and check the status of this cash purchased Super Giant Box?  Best regards,  C',
       'Game it self is great and a ton of fun.   But, the system for showing ads is so annoying.  It\'s not just your normal video ad no, they make you watch 3 different ads and a min of 16 or 11 sec each.  After you have watched the minimum time, you have to hit next and repeat again',
       'Wasted up to 200gems in ultimate league so far. When you lose a match, they offer you to keep your progression in exchange of gems, but they put the option on the right side instead of left. I keep pressing it by mistake and waste gems that I\'d much rather use to reset gang fights instead.',

      'Horrendous abuse of in game ads like I\'ve never seen before in an app. At some points, you literally cannot proceed until you open the play store. The game races are short balancing acts wherein you simply try to keep your car on its wheels. Do not download, and do not let your kids start playing.',
       'Lost all in app purchases which amounts to stealing. Beware of doing in app purchases. Way to many ads. App also crashes a lot. Support said they would help then didn\'t respond after that. If my son was able to lose his progress and the money we sunk in the game because he was using multiple devices and didn\'t know what Cloud and Local meant which cause him to lose his progress then mabe this game shouldn\'t be labeled E for Everyone. Change the rating to Teen if they have to know what cloud means or risk losing there in app purchases.  Google change the rating on this game.',

       'The game is my little boys favourite but the recent batch of adverts in game (Yahoo specifically) don\'t close - meaning you have to force quit the game. Lazy programming and terrible QA process from the developers. Avoid.',
       'Whoever decided to put the HW Poppa wheelie in the game is an idiot. Loved this game until i came across that car. Im seconds away from fully upgrading and moving on but i couldnt let it go. That car is a load of frustration.',
       'Upgrading the vehicles makes little to no improvement to their performance, which makes the game too frustrating. For example you get stuck at exactly the same place without enough grip to go up a dumb hill no much how much you upgrade your car. There\'s no skill involved.  The game forces you to keep playing the same tracks until you get a better car.' ,

      'Whenever I try to open the app the screen starts flashing black and it\'ll stay like that or keeping turning back to the screen I was on and off, which ends up somewhat strobe-like. The actual game itself is amazing despite having a hard time trying to beat the bacteria level but, what\'s the point of a good game concept, if the game won\'t work properly',
       'I thought the new scenario was a free-trial only like the simian flu. (At least you can unlock it after being a brutal pro at the game) I\'m gonna enjoy playing this a good few times and unlock even MORE scenarios. Keep up the good work! I wanted to make a suggestion, but I just can\'t remember now. Oh well...',
       'Fun game. I wish the rate of death was more consistent. 37,000,000 a day at one point, but waiting 6 months for 100,000 to die towards the end. The disease didn\'t change, the rate of death shouldn\'t decrease just because there are fewer people. Good game otherwise',
       'I didn\'t buy the new plague, i might need to. The first 2 difficulty settings are easy, the 3rd not so much. Good game to me! Just have to read what it is that you spend your DNA points on and you should do just fine',
       'Really annoying ads keep repeating and covering controls.  So annoying. Pity as game is unplayable like this. It never used to happen before. Why can\'t developer just charge for extra content rather than make game unplayable. Will have to remove.',
       'Awesome game! Very addicting! You can replay over and over and it doesn\'t get boring! Just keeps getting better!  There is no need to buy if you don\'t want to.... Just because you suck doesn\'t mean it isn\'t beatable... You shouldn\'t give low stars because it\'s a difficult game! It\'s very beatable without purchase!!!  5 stars!!!!  Just keep trying!

      'To many high level players playing in beginner games taking everyone\'s chips. I couldn\'t even get a good chance to try the game because I was cleaned out in the first three tables I played.

But once you have been playing it for bit you get board or at least I do.and to the creators of this game to make it less boring you could put levels or different modes in it or add more  shapes. Please reply or just update. Thank you.',
       'Great game to pass time. Adverts are frustrating but necessary unless you want to pay to stop, BUT very annoying when they pop up as you just lifted a puzzle piece and because of advert it just drops randomly. Also being able to rotate pieces would be handy, granted not as challenging however.',
       'Your English is so bad it is insulting.    You need to hire someone to proof read before you post requests for ratings.  A definite turn off to the game which is actually quite fun and challenging.    Requires strategic planning.',
       'The app is fun but it needs a no ads option for purchase. Also if the game is muted the ads should be auto muted as well. Currently the play at full volume whether the game is muted or not. It\'s very frustrating.',
       'My four year old likes it and I feel like it helps him on making decisions. I can actually see him thinking what going to be him next move. I like this game and I love playing with my son. Only thing I hate is that it does have to many ads 😒',

Please bring Sogaksgak, Tell you something. Or if it can\'t be brought back can the dev team let me know how to find it please it\'s such a lovely song and I keep coming across deadends trying to find it.',
       'I like this game but there are some aspects of it that confuse me. I don\'t understand the point of resetting the Oasis if I\'m just going to lose everything I worked hard to earn and upgrade. Is resetting the only way to play in the other worlds? Also I reset and am now in the star world and none of my blessings stayed like the game said they should. Please explain the full point to resetting the Oasis, other then remembrance shards.',

      'The game is actually really fun for how simple that it is. The main things that is keeping me from giving it 5 stars is that it takes to long to earn coins just to get different balls that don\'t enhance the game at all and I wish there was a way to unlock another revive or multiple devices. Such as milestones, like once you reach 60 or 70 you could earn another one and then maybe 120 or 140 and just continue the pattern from there. Overall a good game though',
       'Very fun game to pass the time. Only issue I have is when you watch a video to revive/ continue a game sometimes it freezes and you lose your progress. Quite frustrating when you\'re close to beating your high score and have to start over. Fix that and this is a simple, fun 5 Star rated game IMO.',
       'What is the point of getting new balls if they don\'t do anything special. Its fun but it gets boring fast because the game play stays the same. Would be better if we had different boards. It gets boring after playing for so long then having to start all the way from the beginning.',
       'Good game, so I paid for ad free, but you still have to watch videos to get coins acquired in game. Very Lame and deceptive. If you pay for Ad Free it should be ad free.',
       'This game is exactly like balls and it\'s not at all what ads show it to be. I deleted a different app for this one, because storage, and I Hugely regret it. I deleted balls a while ago for a reason. If I wanted to play balls, I would just download balls. Not play this cheap ripoff',
       'I can find no where that explains the game to me. Cant use the balls i bought. Stuck in the same game with 1 ball!!! Uninstalled and reinstalled. No change. When i innitially played and had more than 1 ball, the game was great. I am on an Android Galaxy s8.' ,

      'Great game if you wanna run low graphics for a smoother gameplay on your phone. 40 instead of 100 is great for mobile games as well. Maybe make the controls a tad bit larger for default size. Otherwise really fun. Maybe add a first person mode? Unless I haven\'t found out how to haha. Great game. I seemed to like this one out of all the others tbh.',
       'Good game, but after the last update the game game is riddled with bugs and glitches, making the game next to unplayable. Will often come up with queue error and kick me from the game and the screen constantly freezes. I can move, but I can\'t pick anything up and my teammate position is also frozen. Pls fix or I will uninstall. Also, you got rid of the aim button which sucks. Was way better before the update. You\'ve ruined the game for me😭😭😭',
       'One of my favorite games at the beginning.. Ever since the Last 2updates Been facing Problems almost every single Game.Can only run and open Doors can\'t Pick any Weapons.. Sucks I hope y\'all Fix This or Its Time to uninstall this',
       'I honestly liked the game better before the update. You got rid of the aim button, the game is full of glitches like taking damage inside the safe zone, and I get lagged out all the time even though I have a pretty good Wi-Fi connection. To be honest,  you kinda ruined the game.',
       'This game is good and very challenging but i dont like the new update. My overall Stats have stopped working and im still dyeing even when im in circle and the aim button needs to come back it is so hard to play without it.  But overall a good game it just needs a few adjustments.',
       'Okay, why are servers lagging lately? I got killed multiple times because of that! And the glitch where you can\'t pick up items and get damage in safe zone as well, glitches have returned and fix them plz. Also, bring back aim sight! Edit: Ugh, how many times do I need to die because my auto aim didn\'t activate and enemy one did? Bring back aim button, please!' ,

      'Lost all of my bikes when I re-download the app. It shows the 500+ wins I have, but I don\'t even see a way to get the basic ones unlocked again without paying for their stupid VIP package. It sucks that they ruined this app, looking at the iOS version its obvious they haven\'t bothered to update this in years.',
       'Overall, the game is OK . But there is a few issues. My bike tips back and I can\'t stop it from tipping back until I die. But this doesn\'t happen all the time. It happens about every five weeks. Also, I was given a 5$ gift card and a 10$ gift card but I can\'t buy any of the bikes.',
       'After only playing a few short but addicting levels, I am already having a blast! The game may not look spectacular on a technical level. But the gameplay is so freaking fun! And the controls aren\'t too complicated either. Recommended for everyone!',
       'It\'s a fun little game at first, but has many, many flaws. You have to link it to your Facebook account if you wanna play all maps. There are way too many ads, they force you to buy their bikes which are ridiculously overpriced and overpowered, so you can\'t play multiplayer because people who bought those bikes will always beat you. That\'s just ridiculous. Not to mention it\'s very buggy. Sometimes you\'re racing someone who\'s in a completely different track than you. It used to be fun, now it\'s just stupid.',
       'Been playing for a few years and absolutely love the game.  Got a new phone, Moto G5 Plus, and now there is a half second pause every time I hit the gas or break in every race.  Extremely annoying when you\'re racing friends.',
       'Bugs and Glitches... Multiplayer links are not being sent back and forth properly. Some games keep giving me desert level 1 and not showing any replays or ghost bikes are doing a different levels then the one I am suppose to be racing against. Please Fix!!!' ,

      'I was really enjoying the game, it\'s fun. Don\'t get me wrong. But I\'ve signed in every day, every single day and I make sure I do, and sometimes I do it from my iPad and sometimes I do it from my phone. And sometimes it lags and says I missed a day before it fixes. But today I signed in and it told me I missed a day. So I tried it on my phone and it still said I missed a day so I had to restart from the first day in the current collection item. I\'m very frustrated and upset by this. So this whole \'signing on from a different device\' thing is glitchy af and my game got messed up because of it. Very upsetting. Otherwise it would be a 5star.',
       'This game is amazing! Most games of this style sacrifice story for the sake of puzzles, or vice versa, but this is a perfect balance and blend of both. I was hooked from the first moment, and the briliant and individual characters and challenging - but not impossible - puzzles have kept me eagerly impatient to play more. (My only complaint is that the energy refill feels SO SLOW when all I want to do is play more!)',
       'I\'d give 5 stars for everything if the new update would work. It continues to crash. I love this game and wish I could play. I\'m also loosing 2 days of a boost item b/c I can\'t play ANY level.',

       'Thoroughly annoyed now. Another update, another problem. If this could be sorted then it would be worth recommending but once again it\'s glitching so I can\'t play it. Says it\'s awaiting downloads but won\'t do it.',

       'There are wayyyy too many ads seriously. You don\'t need that many ads for your game you have enough money you have a bursting game brand . Most of your games don\'t even have as many ads. Every failed turn "here\'s an ad buy my game!!!!" No!!!',
       'WAYYYYY too many adds. There is an add after EVERY round. That\'s annoying. The game is great, but that\'s NOT how to get people to purchase it. Please consider lessening the adds to maybe once every 5 minutes, and not every 5 seconds!!',
       'My one complaint is the fact when i upgraded my phone and redownloaded this game i lost all my progress from the last phone from this game. Super bummed because I almost had all my characters.',
       'It is a way for marketing. You will get adds after every 30 sec and ad is non skippable. Means its just a way to kill ur precious time and way to frustrate urself. So i would susggest dont install if u want to save ur time.',

Kid\'s can play it because there are no killing in it, well other than if anything hit\' s the guy\'s hed he/she (I really dont know) it will blow up and you will have to start the level all over again.

       'I love the game but its frustrating when you have all 8 Spartans and the sword guys get in the way so maybe an extras set of controls to control where your men start or something. Also for me the screen keeps jumping I try to look at enemy and I catch a glimpse but then it jumps to my side then back again and again and again please fix this.',

      'A very fun game that is both simple and a bit challenging because you have to make literal split-second taps to get it to work properly. The only downside is that it\'s a very short game. There are only two places to colonize and once you\'ve done them and reached level 10 on both, there\'s really nothing left to do. It would be nice if they added more levels to colonize or some other form of continuation.',
       'Good game, played it over a long period here and there and I\'ve basically completed it.  Would love to see more planets! And bigger challenges, as currently every time I go on it my little explorers are making over 1.5 million a day and I\'ve got no where to take my space funding! Haha   Great game imo, just needs more features, planets, asteroids maybe. :) Good job.',
       'It\'s a fun game, just need more planets to jump to and more rocket skins. The colony is just a bunch of people standing on the planet. When I think of colony, I think of buildings and sustaining life and such. Would be nice to see the \'colony\' grow bigger each time you rank up. (Example, more buildings etc.) Also, a choice of a button to press when detaching the rocket and different rocket shapes to choose from. Thank you',
       'Before the update it was quick to grind lots of cash but still it took some time. With my current build, I was reaching 10k+ averaging Greats and Awesomes but now after the update I barely scratch 8K! You guys nerfd the fuccc out the rocket power!!! NEW PLAYERS DON\'T EVEN BOTHER WITH THIS! IT WILL TAKE YOU A VERY, VERY, VERY LONG TIME TO GRIND!!!',
       'Well I was only shown this game last Friday and by today (Wednesday) I have reached level 10 on earth and Mars, both my rockets are fully upgraded. Nothing to do now, I thought you would be able to set up buildings and colonies and keep jumping to different planets. But no. If it\'s enjoyable but over quick, nothing more to it after you you level 10. Can keep taking astronauts up but to what end? You don\'t go no further, they make you money but you\'re maxed out on spending anyway. Shame, concave been really good',
       'A Ads. You get most of your coins by watching ads. So if you want to level up then be prepared to spend some time watching ads. Also an ad will pop up in the middle of the actual gameplay and throw off your rhythm. Gameplay lasts MAYBE 10 seconds, why they need to stick an add in there beats me. Good control,concept,gameplay. Simple and fun' ,

      'Since last update the game takes almost a minute or longer to launch. Game is almost non-responsive when trying to start individual games sometimes taking 3 or more \'touches\' to acknowedge a touch. This game is heading down the toilet fast! Extremely displeased lately and the adverts after each turn, some up to a minute long are horrendous!',
       'Game is great despite the over long adverts. However on every device I have played it on (smartphones and tablets) it flattens the battery in double time. It seems to hog the cpu which gets warm on each device I\'ve played it on. Anyone else have this problem?  When exiting the game I have to go to the device settings and clear the ram to stop the battery draining and the cpu getting hot. Seems to crash a lot too!',
       'Slightly better after latest updates but still not as enjoyable to play as it was before the major update last year. Glitchy, slow to start and to play. Constantly disconnects from network and having to log back in to facebook all the time is annoying. Can be a real chore to play. Might try and persuade my regular opponents to switch to another version. Jan 2018 update - EA, I\'m a balding 46 year old man - why are you constantly showing me ads for Pantene?',
       'Notifications don\'t work. Adverts interfere with game play. Games do not load or refresh properly (seems to be due to loading adverts timing out). Just an awful experience. If EA had any decency they\'d make a single payment purchase option for Android users to remove adverts.',
       'Would be 5 stars if I could lose the ads I can deal with ads you can shut off... Having to watch a video is ridiculous. Rather pay a fiver for the app than watch a gin advert 50 times Oh and why is pilates not in the dictionary? It\'s in Collins online?',
       'Overall, I would not download this game for the following reasons.  Firstly, how come so many words are not recognized? Seriously, June is not a valid word, so are there only 11 months in the year then? However, words like upta do!   Secondly, this app drains battery life as though is using your phone to power a planet. You need to invest in your own power station, if you want to play this game for 10 -15 min sessions.  Thirdly, even for a free app there are too many adverts. I actually forgot I was playing a game and was about to open a bag of popcorn for the feature movie to begin.  Will be uninstalling now.' ,

      'This game is simple. So simple that it is stupidly addictive at times when my mental and physical ability equates to a bowl of fruit. Nothing in this game brings me more satisfaction than the immensity of lag when bolts are caught in rapid bounce in a confined space. I say that with the utmost sincerity, no sarcasm at all. The lag is so intense, so joyful to watch. Please don\'t take it away from me. It is beautiful.',
       'Is this game for You? Do you enjoy spending most of the game watching ads? Do you enjoy games that make it impossible to play without spending real money? Do you enjoy being grabbed by the crotch so hard you change genders?  If you answered yes or no to any of these then no this game is not for you. It\'s nothing but a crappy game designed to rake in as much money as possible, rather than making something fun. Forced to watch 30 second ads after each round. Forced to use the currency you earn when you don\'t want too. Enemy power will suddenly jump up 10 fold making spells and goldimpossible to gain without watching an addition 30 second ad. Even if you win and get the key you are forced to watch a 30 sec ad to unlock as if you didn\'t get a key.',
       'Concept and gameplay is ok, but, like others have said, there are way too many ads. Also the special spells you can unlock are given to you at random. Have a aituation that drill would be great for? Too bad take explosion.',
       'Fun game but takes forever to get gold to upgrade. The cost to pay for the gems to buy so you can buy gold is really expensive. Not much dynamic to the game. Same stuff on each level just takes longer to bet enemies cause of higher HP.',

I reached shield 135 (level 1154) and it doesn\'t level up any more. Gutted! Still a great game but so sad I can\'t progress any more. No reason why really!

      'I\'ve been playing this game for a while and I absolutely LOVE it. but the new update could definitely use some improvements. I have everything in the power category and the suspension maxed out. But everywhere I drive I just flip over and barrel roll everywhere. When I drive foward my truck wants to do a backflip and when I brake it wants to do a front flip. Also, I wish you could change the color of the roof and frontlights (aka the lightbars) but the front light bar doesn\'t even turn on nor does the top light bar that looks like the front one. Please take my review into consideration. Thanks.',
       'I love this game so much it\'s so fun and the gameplay is great. it got even with the update but the update also made the gameplay kinda crappy like when i drive on the side of a hill or just drive and turn my truck flips over all the time and it\'s not as fun to drive cars cause the mechanics for the vehicles feel way  different and not as realistic as before the update. Please fix this i love your game',
       'The game was good and fun before the update now everything is slow.  The shifting takes forever, cars go real slow. The light bars won\'t turn on , spend 4000$ for a light bar is crazy.  The cost to do things are way to high.  It needs more maps as well.  Other then that its a good way to pass a few minutes till you get bored doing the same thing',
       'Only reason I wont give 5 stars is BC anytime you go back to the menu or try to go out riding it will crash. If not on one way it will be the next. Get the crash fixed and ill give it 5',
       'I think it would be a great addition to the game to be able sell vehicles and get a little money back. For instance if we buy a vehicle and don\'t like it but feel like buying a different vehicle we would have the ability. Otherwise I love this game have been playing it since it came out.',
       'An updated fullest review for an updated game: The new & much needed update is here! Most of the issues in the previous version have been addressed giving a more polished feel. The great new additions give a much more complete feel to the game as well. Players of the original version may not like the update at first, vehicles seem less powerful then before. Can get most of it back by re-tweaking the suspension & getting familiar with the new manual shift, (which should have been positioned on the right side to allow us to shift while steering). I\'d give 5 stars now except the shifting issue & the app crashes far too often, even on lowest graphics setting. I want to blame my phone but this is the only game I\'ve played that does this. Maybe it plays better on other devices? Definitely worth trying.' ,

       'This is a fun and enjoyable game..  honestly I am addicted to it and most of all the DRAGONS  are awesome.  My frustration  however  is that challenges are too short   which does not give us enough time to finish the tasks.   Also it takes too long to replenish gems, food and tokens  otherwise  this is a great game to play during your spare time.',
       'This is my favorite mobile game but I only rated it four stars for 1 reason. Training takes sooooo long. 48 hours for one move is outrageous as I think waiting 24 hours for a move is a bit crazy. I think there are ways for the system to improve. Like the ability to at least feed the training dragon, maybe even battle with the dragons while they train. Or at least shorten the waiting time. But so far, that is by far my biggest complaint.',
       'Ok game but the price to play is outrageous. The deveolpers are to greedy; price for coins and how far they go in the game is not reasonable. The events are structured to make you pay money throughout. When you think you are close the price will increase leaving you unsatisfied and dissapointed!!' ,

      'Game itself is definitely a good throwback to the Tap Tap days, however I\'m disappointed with how Everlong (Foo Fighters, 100 rubies) cuts off at 2:02, rather than playing the entire song. Progression of rubies is kinda slow, which becomes bothersome if you don\'t enjoy pop music.',
       'I\'d love to give this game a good review but could never get it to work. It just kept saying I needed to download the YouTube app (which I already had) and reopen the game... I tried several times. Even tried opening the YouTube app and then the game, it still just keeps asking me to download the YouTube app. 😢😢😢',
       'Liked it until some glitches came. Sometimes when i tap a note, it registers as a miss even though the key was pressed. It messes up with my combo streak. I even tested it multiple times, even with a slower song and it still happened',
       'The game runs well but the music videos lag my phone. Would be 5☆ if you\'d implement an option to turn the videos off and on.',
       'I really enjoy this game. If you stick with it and feel the beat, you become better. That\'s how it worked for me. I believe it helps me with my rhythm in general. Plus, you will get this accomplished feeling as you improve. I look forward to mastering the hard difficulty .',
       'Neat game used to play the old versions, keep hitting me with double ads and ill make sure i never spend a cent. Would drop cash to get ad free but ill just find way to bypass them for free.' ,

      'This game is so edicting. I only just got it and ime loving it. I allredy have a rell chanel but this game makes making a vidio simple and fun. All you have to do is tap pres publish and boom you get nice coments good vuis and nice suggestions. Man oh man am i adictid to this game. Good adictid it really really is such a good game. That my freind is why i gave it 5 stars and recomend it to evry one. It is just as good if not better than peudiepies tuber simulator. So pleas get this one',
       'I get that free games have ads. That\'s fine. But you can\'t get 20 taps in or switch to a new tab before you get another 30/50 second ad. I thought this was just a fluke, but it keeps happening every 30 seconds like it\'s on a timer. This game would be fantastic other wise. Uninstalled it after the first half hour.',
       'I found that this game is so addicting till you got like 100000 views ever second... then it becomes very boring... but I do recommend it to people who want a game to play for like 2 weeks but don\'t expect any big reward for play long... I just want tapps to make something rewarding to getting higher like designing your gaming setup or actual able to make a video and upload it to the game... overall good game',
       'Surprisingly fun. I\'m iffy on idle clicker games but the reviews convinced me; there\'s lots of unique aspects to this game that other clicker games don\'t have. It\'s competitive, which is cool, and you can actually customize the upgrades. The main thing that makes me stay away from idle clickers is that there\'s no customization. In this game you can customize your room and yard, character, and even choose the videos you post. Lots of fun stuff to do, definitely worth a try.',
       'This game has to be the most fun game I have ever played. It\'s so simple yet so amazing at the same time. I guess the only thing I can say about this game is that it needs more topics for videos to make. I find myself always making the same videos over and over it really needs different topics to add. You could add topics such as more animal topics. My idea is a pig topic since there is an option to get a pig outdoor of your house or a bird topic since you could also get a bird in the game. Sorry if this short review is pretty long just have a lot of ideas. I really hope you guys read this I would really appreciate it. Thank you so much I think this game still has a lot more things to add.',
       'READ THIS NOW!!!!! i love it it is very addictive a great time killer and once you start playing it you can\'t stop unless your battery is dead.how you play it  js t hat you make videos and then by tapping ijt you earn money an d when you have enough 🤑$$$ you can buy a pug and then he has a store and you buy stuff for it. You also can put stuff in your backk yard. And you c an change the way you look. And the best part i s you can buy really cool stuff with the diamonds and you can earn more subscribers. Thank you for reading this it took me 2 min.to type it' ,

      'Some things are hidden in such a place makes it hard on note 8 due to curved screen. Level 89 doesn\'t work, as well as other levels where touching the same place over and over and over might get something to work.  Most puzzles are extremely easy,  it\'s just a matter of the game not working.',
       'Got stuck playing til lvl 40 before I realized an hour had past, and I only came to the play store looking for sonic 3, but this looked interesting listed under "recomended." Great recommendation.',
       'I found it boring. A character in the game tells you what to do, where to find the key etc and you do it, then you move a level up. How is that exciting? But millions of people do, so go figure.',
       'Good time killer, only bad thing is I would have to constantly restart the level just to get the controls to work, it\'s like it would freeze up and the rooms where you have to shake your device a lot of the times the items wouldn\'t come out, but overall I enjoyed the 120 levels',
       'There needs to be a Hint button and not just a skip button. Some of these I would\'ve really loved to try and figure out I just needed a little help but there\'s no way to get help.....unless I missed it somewhere. 🙁',
       'Now I\'ve tried many unlock the door games but that\'s the game with most great graphics and type and the plus point is you can skip the levels u don\'t think u can solve withoit paying or any promotions of the app ...loved it !' ,

      'I love this game. Its and absolute tome waster and lovely to play. However, I had set my phone to the side to let it play out (as I was over 1400) and it reset on its own. I had cleared the screen the round previously so there was no chance of me losing to that. It was behind me and I never would have reset it. Is this some sort of glitch? If it is, please fix it soon. Aside from this, this is amazing.',
       'I really, really love this game, but, I keep losing my ball count and I don\'t understand why this is happening. For instance, I have 90 balls and I\'m supposed to have 92, I don\'t get the 92. I will give 5 stars until the bug is fixed. The ads I don\'t care about because that only happens at the end of each game which is ok. Please fix this so I can give you 5 stars.  Update- I figured out why I keep losing my count with my balls. Everytime I get the balls by the number blocks, it wouldn\'t count them😐 I could get a lot further if this was fixed. If this keeps on happening, I\'m going to uninstall this game. I hope it doesn\'t come to that because I really love this game. Please fix asap!!',
       'If I could give zero (0) stars for controls, that would be too high. The game is fun and addictive. But there is a restart button that there is NO REASON FOR. I have lost my progress three times with scores over 1000, which takes weeks to achieve. THE DEVELOPER DOES NOT RESPOND EVER. Uninstalling.',
       'It\'s good at first but you\'ll lose returning customers. Where are the power ups? Maybe an ultra bull that acts as 2 hits each turn. Nothing is drawing me back to and having me for higher school. In fact high score just means waiting longer. Could potentially be a great game.',
       'Best ever! Addicted to it. Cute graphics and fun color make it great! The aim-and-fire technique makes it original! Installed it 2 days ago, top score 72 average score 50!  P.S. If you like this app (which you probably do) try Amazing Thief! Great and another Ketchapp marvel! I\'m not spoiling it, but I will tell you it\'s a lot like Flappy Bird. If you don\'t know what Flappy Bird is, well then look it up.  P.P.S.  Anyone here would probably have at least SEEN Flappy Bird, but seriously. It is like an Aztec-age game.',
       'Both my husband and I have this game.  I opted to pay for the no ads though, he did not.  DO NOT do this!  He is able to get "continues" for watching adds and can keep climbing up the levels.  I cannot since I purchased no adds.  I get to continue once and that\'s all since I have stopped ads from allowing me to get the extra chances.  I wish I would have known this beforehand. Otherwise, this game is seriously fun and addicting.' ,

      'This is one of the best flip games I have played in a long time. Love the way they have implemented the physics in the game. It is like flipping the real thing. Every knife has it\'s own style of flipping. The collection is also amazing. Best part you don\'t need to buy gold for knifes. You can earn it. Some of the blades are paid but won\'t mind buying them as it is worth. Amazing job people 👍',
       'Hi! The game is amazing. Simple, yet very addictive. The color scheme is amazing, and the sounds are great. But I do have one little complaint ; Sometimes the "Card" knife doesn\'t stick into the log when it lands on the tip, although it should clearly stick and count as a point. Have a wonderful rest of your day :)',
       'REALLY FUN AND INTERESTING. i like how there is a very large variety of knives available to get. A few problems : i am not willing 2 pay money for a knife in a game, it glitches and lets me watch infinite vids 4 infinite money, some of the knives are really stupid',
       'This is a great time-passer (if you finally have some spare time) , good graphics, and mostly good physics.    However, I recently discovered that players are punished via a lock timer for marathoning advertisements to unlock knives... Why?',
       'A fun and addictive game but there are some issues with the game\'s economy. It\'s all about collecting the different knives but to do that you need a large amount of money which is earned the fastest with the expensive knives (Or just watching ads). The knife you may enjoy the most may only be 1 coin per flip so you feel forced to use another one worth 2 or 3 that you don\'t enjoy as much. I would like to see a system implemented that lets you upgrade a knife to be worth more so you have an incentive to try and use new knives that aren\'t initially worth 3 coins per flip but can be upgraded to be worth 3.',
       'Great visuals, smooth physics, and addicting Gameplay. Great game, my only thing I\'d change would be the end-game knives, past 10k all the knives kinda suck, and have awful \'flipability\', making it pointless to save up for anything above 10-15k. If you added a better variety of knives into the game this would be a 5 star.  Also, this game hasn\'t been updated since early December 2017. Please update it.' ,

      'This is a very entertaining game that is simple to play. It has provided me with hours of fun! The only thing is that I wish there were more combinations, there are things I\'ve tried that you\'d think would make something but don\'t. For example, Crayon (or Pencil, or Charcoal, or Paint) + Paper does not make Art.',
       'Such a fun game!! I love that you can watch an ad to get hints instead of ads just popping up all the time like other free games. I\'ve been a fan since the first one and this one is way better! Cuter graphics and more information about the things you create. Great way to pass the time in a no-stress, purely fun way!',
       'This game is pretty addicting. I get stuck sometimes but I always find something new.  Small issue though, I it won\'t let me pull rust out onto the screen for some reason. I\'ve used it before, but now it won\'t let me use it anymore. Perhaps it is an issue with my phone rather than a glitch in the app.',
       'This is leagues better than the original alchemy game. There were a lot of bugs but they\'ve all more or less been patched out. It took me 2 months of playing everyday to get all of the items and combinations cleared.',
       'I love this game so much. I\'m stuck on trying to make life but it\'s not frustrating it\'s challenging and I like it. Also, for all the people getting pissed off because the items disappear and you cant \'use\' them anymore it\'s because you can\'t combine them with anything anymore so it is put in your encyclopedia so that doesn\'t waste space for the things you can use, it\'s actually a very smart game mechanic. I\'m pretty sure it even says that in the tutorial. I also like how they didn\'t take the same combination formulas from the first game and instead added new ways to achieve the same product in a more realistic way, also there is so many items to create! So I think that this is an all around great game. Good job developers. Good job indeed.',
       'Its a cool game. If you press the hint button it gives you a choice to watch a ad for help. I am not seeing in-app purchases so far and I have had this game for a while! I recommend this but not the other version. It gets a tiny bit boring after a while though. overall, GREAT GAME! Whoever made this game is great! :) :) :)' ,

      'All the main movie characters and space ships to use. Wish u would make more farmable but over one of the best games out there. I actually prefer it compared to Xbox due to no issues with extensive network down periods. If u want us to pay then we gotta be able to play when we want right? Someone else should send that to Xbox they stopped caring long ago. Well done again for the game',
       'Amazing game. Really hits me in the childhood. Great mechanics, events, character moves/abilities, great art style, and unlike most mobile games, does not require paying a dime. It may take a while to reach a high level, but with practice and dedication, you can really go far in this game. I even recommended it to a lot of my family members. Would rate higher than 5 stars if that were an option. No problems whatsoever with the game.',
       'This update gave the players most of the things they have been asking for over a year now. The only issue i have is that EA is still pushing its pricing model with this game. 300 dollars to full star up a character + another 200 for gear. Its a bit much. The F2P is still full and while you will be hardpressed to make it to number 1 on your shard it is possible and gives great satisfaction. I would recommend atleast giving it a try.',
       'Just d/l this like a week ago. Very good game, the turn based RPG style works well, the graphics are top notch, as well as the sound is accurate and superb. The only thing is: I just updated it and now cant get past the Lucas film/Disney screen now. The update was not interrupted at all when I downloaded it, but I suspect it got corrupted, contacting support, hope they can help me I do NOT want to start over.',
       'The game looks interesting, but when you\'ve finished the tutorial you have to give permissions to Contacts (and then maybe other permissions), which is a big red flag for me. There is absolutely no reason ask for permissions like this just to sign up, with no way to proceed and gracefully opt-out!  Beware that by giving them the Contacts permission you are giving away other people\'s information, not just your own! \'Just say no\' to invasive app permissions.',
       'I\'ve been playing this game for a good year. It is the one game on mobile that I\'ve never put down. I love the grind and how rewarding it is. It is not pay to win, and you can max out every character without paying a cent. EA made something truly great here! Ecspically if your a die hard star wars Fan! They update almost monthly always with new characters! 11/10!' ,

      'Several times now I\'ve tried to type in a logo name and the app has told me I got it wrong but I thought it was right and couldn\'t see why I was being told I was wrong. So I hit "solve" and the answer is exactly what I typed in.  I have also had a few times now where I\'ve recognised the logo but there are letters missing when I try to type in the name.  I had what I suspect to be this app deferral years ago and had no problems with it at all but since this new look and expanded number of logos has appeared it feels like you\'ve ruined a fun app. Any chance of fixing this screw up?',
       'Several times I have tried to use a hint and it  wouldn\'t take it off and it was difficult and easy. When I type in the logo it would tell me I\'m wrong then I hit solve and it was the same thing I wrote also and if people don\'t know some of the logos what is the point of the game.',
       'It is both difficult and easy to play and also this game has different types of logos so if we don\'t know one we can just know it by this game. It is wonderful for me because there is not a single problem. It doesn\'t seem to be bad for me i  meant the game was not at all bad and it was particularly different from some of the reviews means some people said this game this and that but it doesn\'t seem to me the same thing because each of us has a different choice but according, to me it was great, amazing, wonderful game. Thanks for making this types of games and it is good because it teaches us something so thx once again. 😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😊😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😋😋😋😋😋😋😋😋😋',
       'First Level at Barbie and Twitter, even if type the words correct, the app tells me that there\'s a mistake. Solve shows me exactly the same word I\'ve typed in before',
       'It\'s too easy to amass a huge number of hints and use them. I\'d like not to be able to complete every level without doing some online searches.',
       'This app is nice. One thing I like about this app is it takes only one single unit to give a random letter hint because I have seen in many apps that they take 60 or 90 coins or whatever unit to just show a letter and this app haves daily bonus 30 coins so I love this app but I think that the app members should give a little attention on the animation because it is not so clear. Besides this all all the best for the team of this app and make good apps further.' ,

      'How can an update make it worse? I pay for no ads but still get tons of ads. And the so called IDLE has just disappeared. Can no longer earn coins when not playing. Do something decent with my money or give it back 😡',
       'Insane amount of ads! There are even options to watch an ad for a reward but it doesnt work. The game had potential for an idle quick game. But the ads kill it. Turn of data and wifi everytime id open this app. Before the update, the game would continue in the background but not any more, thanks to the crazy grinding element and ads, not worth a single byte of space imo.',
       'TOO MANY ADS that you are forced to watched involuntarily. And if you play an As in order to get a reward. You will not get one. It gets boring once you merge your car to level 30. Nothing to do much. PLS LESSEN THE ADS!!!',
       'The game was a decent waste of time.  My biggest complaint is the insane amount of ads.  You get an adult every level up, every time you open up the buy car selection, everytime you bring a car back in off the track.  It\'s literally crazy.  Sure you can make an in ap purchase to get rid of the ads.  They put in so many ads they make you want to buy the option to get rid of them.  I\'m deleting this game.',
       'This game has a lot of potential but is under par. It has so many ads that to play the game I literally turned off my wifi. There\'s also a bug that is very annoying. Whenever you pull a car off a track you can\'t put it back on immediately, and it\'s stuck where you called it back. The game also lacks a feeling of progression. Whenever I upgrade to the next car I feel like I\'m taking a step back. Also the economy is all out of whack with cars going into the thousand thousands. I disliked the experience and would not recommend the game to anyone.',
       'Paid for no ads, now can\'t earn money when not playing. Lost billions, thanks a lot. Seeing as you mucked the game up, either give me my billions I\'ve lost, or refund my premium I Paid!!!' ,

      'Playing as a Lady/Lord of Westeros, you get to strategically create a powerful house of noble soldiers, attack creatures and enemies on a stunning and accurate map of Westeros and lay Seige to renowned houses and take Seats of Power. Free and pay to play, time is of the essence. Not much of a story, although events give ample rewards and joining a Leige and their bannermen have it\'s perks, like taking over houses with status will give your troop and kingdom a number of buffs.  Not much of a tutorial, apart from basic growth. Maybe give a tutorial for equipping items to your character and how to level them up.  Join the battles of Westeros and survive the winter!',
       'currently cant collect my trained troops so cannot train more. have tried restarting, clearing cache no success. Yesterday i spent 3500 gold on wood and it gave me food. These glitches and others are seriously starting to impact the overall enjoyment of an otherwise good game and i have been playing since beta release. please address as all my tickets seem to have been ignored.',
       'The game is vastly unbalanced. You have one alliance paying to play dominating everyone. Once you get hit you can get hit again and again. Instead of only being allowed to hit a player once. This game was simply made to make you spend money. So if you have money better have lots of it, and if you don\'t I\'d suggest playing something else you\'ll just get bullied.',
       'I purchased a few packs of theirs, due to some game glitches I lost all my troops, no wounded, no war no reports. Developers are unable to explain why it happened. And when I ask for my 838,530 troops they are giving paltry sum of game gold 100,00. Whereas the troops which are lost will require atleast 1,217,426.96 gold.imagine my plight. Wasted time and money on a glitchy and buggy app. Just playing coz am a GOT fan, and these guys milk us for money.',
       'Improving, but still... A pay to play game all the way. Serious issues with notifications ans in game reports (which the game has options to set and therefore should be in top working order). It *is* a war game, being notified lf enemies and being clearly able to predict losses during one\'s own attacks should not be a concern for the players. Losing what amounts to circa 250 thousand of value in ingame gold because of these issues (paid for with approximately 120 €€) and then offered 18 thousand gold as "compensation for the issues" is tough. Protesting and being granted 25 thousand more for the "inconvenience" is then insulting.',
       'It\'s exactly like Game of War but themed with Game of Thrones. If you liked GOW you will like this game for sure. I am enjoying it, sometimes the game crashes but considering I am using an older phone the gameplay is not bad and with every updates that\'s getting better.' ,

       'Ok game, but bingo mode is a huge pain.  My shots filled out the opponent\'s card better than mine.  Stupid way to lose a lot of progress/coins.',
       'Game was fine. Lately, keeps freezing and somehow opponents are getting 10\'s when I CLEARLY see them hitting nowhere near the middle. Matches are freezing while i\'m ahead, then match ends and says I lost. Somehow i\'ve lost 20 million coins, and not from legit losing either. I also just played a match for 1 million coins, i had over 1 million in the bank. I know sonehow have 0 after I clearly won the match but it said I lost. Either people are using cheats or the game is not functioning properly',
       'Good  game when it works. Seems to run out your  time  and  freeze  up  when  you start  winning  to  much',
       'DONT DOWNLOAD THIS GAME!!!  2-3 weeks ago i wrote very good review about this game. But since last week I understood that there are bots in the game. When the prize is lower your opponents will be from the real life as you. But when you are playing for the higher amount, your opponent will be bot who scores in 1 second without aiming. DEVELOPERS, THIS IS FRAUD!!! I SPENT HOURS ON THIS GAME AND MY BUDGET WAS ALMOST 12 MILLION. BUT BECAUSE OF THE BOTS (USUALLY NAMES LIKE SAMUEL, ALEX, KATIE, BRUNO AND PROFILE PICTURES ARE CATS OR DOGS) I LOST ALL MY MONEY. AND DO YOU KNOW WHAT IS STUPID? YOUR OPPONENT SCORES 10 TWO TIMES IN 1 SECOND AND JUST BECAUSE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE THINKS THAT IF YOU LOSE YOU WILL HAVE NO MONEY LEFT, SUDDENLY YOUR SUPER HERO OPPONENT SCORES 8 TWO TIMES AND LOSES AGAINST YOU!!! YOU ARE COMMITING FRAUD!! DELETED THE APP ALREADY!!',

      'Omg I love this game! Thought that I was addicted to zombie castaway but this is on a whole nother level. I kinda put this in mind of treasure island on FB until it got cancelled but I also think this is better than that too. I love that u can get energy easy and that u can also find more energy by digging. If diggy ever finds his dad I hope that won\'t be the end of the game. Maybe they can start a new adventure together.',
       'It was better when I first started playing it. The more you get engrossed in it, the more you find all kinds of popups to try and get you to buy the little chests and gems and whatever else they offer to keep digging. The further you go, the more you find even larger blocks that waste more energy and less rewards for your efforts. Not to mention, many more wild goose chases to waste more energy with no rewards whatsoever. Waste of time which leads to a waste of money.',
       'At first it was great but now it doesn\'t load anymore. So disappointed! It\'s becoming tedious. Even after every update, game lags even more. Gonna be a total waste of space if it doesn\'t improve.',
       'How is a person supposed to get help and support. I\'m stuck at the florist with the beams. Got the first set. But the next is so crowded I can\'t get any of the mirrors where I think they need to go. To tight. There\'s a yellow and blue.',
       'A pretty good puzzle game. Just wish that some of the pieces didn\'t cost so much energy, or the spaces in your bunker we\'re cheaper. Either way though, it\'s fun, and a great way to kill some time. :)',
       'Beginning of game is fast moving as you level up and get lots of energy. After lvl20 your energy will run out within mins. Need a watch ads to get gems as it gets really slow at lvl30 onwards. 3hrs of waiting, 5mins of gameplay.' ,

      'This game is really fun and interesting. But i have a question. Under your character which says tap on me, there were 3 choices in it, although i\'m not sure if those are actually choices. As i try to tap on them, nothing happens. Is that really normal? Or am i suppose to do something? Especially since one of the options there was "meet the lost soul." Please help me out',
       'The game is AMAZING !! I got all three endings already and it was super fun. I just really hope there will be an offline version so I can play it without WiFi, it\'s a good time waster. Also, maybe you can put a feature where if you press the person you are in that life, you can see the stuff they have like the superhero, smart feature, timeshare, etc. , so that it\'s easier to know what our person has. Also, maybe put a description for it? Just a suggestion! Play Nirvana guys it\'s great!!',
       'This is a very great game, and I\'d recommend that people download. It just seems that I have a small bug. I\'m not sure how many others have it, but when my character reaches an age in the range 50-70, the game crashes and starts over. It doesn\'t save the years in the grave years either. If this were to get fixed, I would totally give it five stars. Until then. Keep up the great work, though!',
       'Hi dev, i sometimes don\'t understand whats the icon under character\'s name means. Can you please put what it means in help sections? or maybe you could make a list about that in game that you could unlock.  That\'s just a suggestion though. I love your game, keep up the good work 👍',
       'Alright, so in a response to someone else\'s review, you said that talking to Death could give a hint as to how to get the third ending; the advice that comes when you ask how to escape is pretty much useless, so I assume the advice that\'s supposed to help me beat this cursed game is the "if He eats too many years he explodes" part. However, I\'ve gotten over 800 years in, and the Creator hasn\'t exploded. At this point I don\'t even care about getting the third ending, I just want that bastard to explode.',
       'This game is so good. I\'m really quirky so I really enjoy this game. Definitely deserves a download. I told my friends about this game but they have an apple phone so if you could, could you upload the game to apple please because my friend is now really depressed because she can\'t find the game in the apple store' ,

      'Online matchmaking is utterly broken and totally pay to win. Total mismatches being paired up against guys 5 levels higher with all higher card levels as well. Unless you\'ve got money to burn don\'t waste time grinding through ranks cause 45+ will best you down. Even if you do have the money to burn your still better off using it to keep warm as throwing it at this game will just give you the faintest satisfaction you\'ve accomplished something by simply having access to better cards then those you face.',
       'Add 1 energy cost to smuggler ike since he\'s 2 mana with a better passive than Sally and honestly what\'s the point if you use 1 7 cost card, you\'ve lost. End of story. Legend player by the way. To all saying it\'s pay to win? I am legend rank and 100% free to play :) so don\'t get discouraged get smart! ( I just don\'t have the money to spend ) but just letting you all know.',
       'Since I\'m the last person who isn\'t cheating here\'s 3 suggestions... synch pvp so both players get the same energy. Temp ban every player generating more energy than possible in a game. Cheating players don\'t pay, they don\'t need to. This game would be awesome if 90% of the players weren\'t cheating. And a 3rd suggestion... synch pvp games so players get the same energy .',
       'Like the others say: Too much pay to win Lots of poor sportsmanship, without ability to block I\'m always paired against higher level opponents. If you like a game that is constantly difficult and irritating, play this. Also, install ES File explorer, and it will show you all the background ads they download on your phone!',
       'The constant loading screens are a pain. The fact that this game forces you to spend money to get better loot is horrible. The random loot lockers are awful, a lot of times the rewards you get are the worst, and even if you play a level several times there is no guarantee that you eventually would get better cards or upgrades from it. Even if you try to grind there is not much of a progress or reward from it. This is definitely a pay to win game.',
       'I have binged this game for only 30 hours and it does continue to entertain and challenge your playing tactics.  If you have a knowledge or love for the show then you will definitely want to see and hear the gameplay and special thoughts the developers put into making this South Park masterpiece!' ,

       'A fantastic port of a platformer that still holds up to modern titles. It\'s pretty, the music is great, the gameplay is varied and fast, and the overall experience is just pleasant. The touch controls can take a little breaking in but overall they do the job.',
       'I agree the controls are really difficult. I played this game when it first came to the us via the Sega Genesis and those controls were way better. If you truly want to play this game right get one of those joystick accessories, otherwise good luck. It seems to go okay in the levels but beating Robotnic is much, much harder.',
       'Installed the game on my chomebook. I was told that it should work fine on it. After installing it, and watching one of the ads...I couldn\'t continue. Tried relaunching a few times to get it to work...Not worth my time, or money to unlock.',
       'Such a great port with good controls ruined by ads. I was about to buy the full version until SEGA stopped me when I saw that I will still get ads of their items. What\'s the difference if the ads are just going to be replaced with SEGA ads? Please fix this, I don\'t think anyone is going to be persuaded to buy the item because  of your advertising if you be annoying about. In fact, this will stop people from buying the full version of other games. I love SEGA, and I\'ve been supporting Sonic Mania and Forces since day one, but this is unacceptable.',
       'I may have some bias because the OG was always my favorite CLASSIC Sonic game (I have done multiple no death runs, while getting all 6 emeralds as early as possible). Unlike the Genesis/MD version, this offers multiple save slots (with a no save mode if you want the original experience), optional spin dash (OG did not have), polished transition from a roll to a jump, and multiple characters. It\'s basically the 3DS version, but it has a bit more content. The game doesn\'t have ads during gameplay, only between levels. If you don\'t like this, then you can pay a measly $2 to remove them. Some complain about the controls, but I think they\'re fine. If you really need to use a stick or d-pad, the game can use some blue tooth controllers. In conclusion, this is by far the definitive version of Sonic OG.' ,

      'I\'m not far into it, but it\'s fun so far. My eyesight could be why it\'s not a 5-star experience. The more complex levels are very small and give me a headache after a couple of mazes. I believe the contrast and color schemes could be improved and make the game better. It\'s still a very good game though.',
       'Sublime controls, varying but very original and fun game modes, and an online leaderboard for the ones interested..!  I\'d easily rate this 5 stars if the white-on-grey theme didn\'t give me a headache! For the love of whatever God is out there, at least give the choice between a light and dark theme, PLEASE?!',
       'If you like doing mazes, then I highly recommend this game. It\'s by far the best maze game app I\'ve come across! Not only is it addicting, but it is fun and more challenging/authentic then any other maze games I\'ve tried. There are plenty of levels/modes to keep you entertained. It\'s the only maze puzzle app I\'ve found worth playing! 😀💜',
       'I love mazes and this game keeps me on my toes. Even though I haven\'t played it too long, an adult ad popped up that I felt was inappropriate. This concerns me because my 7yo daughter is also fond of mazes. Now I\'ll have to download a separate kid version for her.',
       '5 stars, the game does exactly what it should do, and the controls are simple and intuitive, but please, can you add a feature to prevent the screen from turning off? It messes a little when I try to mentally solve the classic mazes',
       'Where is the challenge? This game is as lame as the rest of the maze games. If you would  try make the game more challenging then maybe I would not have deleted it.' ,

      'Good I hope they fixed the bug where you double buy a car and it gives you the same car but still takes your money. But its still a great game. Ohh! And also raise thr chance if getting a legendary I played for almost a year and I never got one l. My friend got one all the time on his apple but there Is a glitch with android.ive never had one.',
       'Good, but has some bugs I\'m sorry if I\'m being too critical in this review but especially on Mobile Data, Smashy Road can lag. This is to the extent the game will no longer work. Moving on to a positive, the graphical interface is very nice, the perspective, movement and background vehicles is very well created.  Very good game overall',
       'It\'s good but... I enjoy playing this game, there isn\'t too much skill involved but it\'s a good way to kill time and it stays easy enough to make it enjoyable while raising the difficulty.  The only thing I want to see is no more of this, automatically backing up stuff. When you are nose first in an object, the game automatically backs you up, but I\'ve lost countless games because it doesn\'t stop or doesn\'t back up enough. Let me choose when to back up!',
       'Good but... you can sometimes glich and get trapped but it\'s a good game anyway like you run from police. Also when you start off you have to press right or left to start so you can\'t go straight forward when you get on. I really liked it though it is one of my favourite games! I\'m out  Later ima go play some Smashy Road now!',
       'Shalom there, The game is awesome. I liked it very much and hoping that in the future they will be more cars to be added. I really hope that "military helicopter" can shoot something, it is funny...so idle. Last thing, a HOVERCRAFT can go "river mode" ! Wrecked... because of...water. Hope you\'ll add the " police boats " in next update. Overall, abundant of thanks and good luck.',
       'I LOVE THIS GAME. It just need\'s some work to do. Like, you guys need to fix the glitch of the lines by the road. And you need to fix when we explode the oil truck and fall on the ground and you disapear. And can u guys please add some new prizes like to change the color of ur car. And when I have 100 dollars u can spend it on colors  theirs a button to choose what prize you want. Like say I get the color blue for a red car. And I like the red car so I go to the prize machins and choose to buy a color than I have the button to change the color of ur car. That will make the game a lot better. And I\'m sure when u do it there will be more downloads.' ,

This game is addicting but it\'s hard to get past level 20 if you don\'t have Facebook. So I\'m stuck on trying to get enough stars to get through. Good but could be better',
       'This is a very well thought out game and I love the positive comments when I finally figure out the  way I need to go first so that the next shot is easier to get. Some of these shots are really difficult, if you don\'t get the right basket first. Anyway, I love the challenge. Y\'all got my vote. BEST GAME EVER. Thanks man. I love your guys\' creativity.',
       'Firstly to John J - I have never paid a cent to play this game and that is why I love this game!! I have been able to complete the whole game 210 levels without paying a dime! That\'s truly awesome! It has been challenging because in order to advance I needed to get 3 stars on all levels to open up the next level for free. Then of course you have the energy bar that runs out, but that\'s ok because it replenishes in reasonable time. I would run out and instead of paying money I would go check an email, or post on Facebook and before too long I\'m back playing a few more shots on dude perfect 2!! So easy, so cheap, so challenging and so much fun and so friggin awesome when you completed level in 3 stars!! I can\'t wait till the next section opens to see what they have in store for us. Thanks.',
       'This game is clearly set up for suckers to pay ridiculous amounts of money to play.   1. Energy bar--- really? 2. Constant ads some of which you have to watch. 3. Want coins? Watch their YouTube videos, get them more views, more money, more endorsements. 4. Don\'t worry, after about $100 you can have everything and probably still have ads. 5. If you can get past all the BS posted above, after about level 35, this game gets so freaking hard that you cannot derive any fun nor entertainment at all.  These guys are entertaining but this game by the devs is clearly set up for money and sucking the entertainment value right out of what could be a fun game.',
       'I love this game and it is awesome. Here\'s some tips characters are expensive and you should have a story mode otherwise it is awesome. Miniclip keep working. I love your your other games like 8 ball pool and basketball stars. Just keep Freakin doin great. You need some work but otherwise great.',
       'It was kind of boring but I give it a three as you can see but I guess it was not as bad as I thought it would be so I guess yeah id recomend it. Also don\'t forget to subscribe to dude perfect, logan paul vlogs, tanner braungardt, tanner fox, and quake gaming tv.' ,

      'I effing hate the new ways, they just made me pay 25,000 to upgrade my ball when it used to be 2 gs. But other than that this game is badasss',
       'I really enjoy the gameplay and the multi-player aspect of it. One thing I hate recently tho is the fact that the price tag for bags have literally tripled since the new update. It isn\'t easy to earn gold and now it\'s gonna take forever to get the good bags. I wished that the cash money earned from matches can go into purchasing in game bags or other in game accessories. They made this game pay to win now which is so retarded.....',
       'It is a pretty nice game and it is quite addictive...lots of avatar options..i even purchased d Valentine pack but sometimes like in 2 out of matches this game gets glitchy which causes u lose money that u bet...quite frustrating that part though',
       'It was MUCH more fun prior to the last update. For me at least now, it is next to impossible to win. If you have no chance of winning,  takes all the fun out of it.',
       'I\'m playing and I have people twice my level i lost 60 grand how is that fair? Don\'t feel like recommending it anymore.',

      'The in app purchases are a little overboard. I normally wouldn\'t pay for stuff in an app but for this game I would definitely not even consider it. Nothing should cost more than $50, but there are packages in this app costing $100... that\'s way too much and I really don\'t like it. The only thing I want to see in the game is the ability to upgrade things with a percent amount of money. (10%, 25%, 50%, 75%, and obviously max which already exists)',
       'It was a fun time waster while it lasted. I had the game for about 3 days and it just wouldn\'t load anymore. I tried uninstalling and re-instlling but the load screen gets stuck in the same spot. I\'ve uninstalled the app but again, fun while it lasted.',
       'Good game, nice time waster. Got the latest update and now the game will not load past 42%. I missed put on the last day of a special event due to this issue.',
       'Very fun for me to play, but honestly it\'s a little too addictive. Especially when special mines come up to complete',
       'Love this game but The escalator on the amethyst mine is stuck?? halfway down. Getting no ice cash!! Very frustrating 😣😣',
       'I think it\'s fun . I get kinda sad when I can\'t play cause the managers are managing but I can when they make to much and I need to catch up lol 🤗' ,

      'You need to update the original Candy Crush and make it like the rest of the Saga. What I\'m trying to say is most of the color combinations are different from the original Candy Crush. For instance: connecting four colors and making a fish you can\'t do it on the original Candy Crush. And you took out the donut wheel from the rest of the Saga, what\'s up with that?',
       'Level 273 is broken. When matches are made the whole screen full of candies scrolls rapidly downward and there is no endpoint no matter how many Monklies are formed. Impossible to complete level! Before this, my favorite game.  2/15/18  Now #287 won\'t produce any monklies even when more than 90 gold candies are sent to the bubble. Can\'t get off this level!',
       'Great but hate it when a level versus another critter. If i wanted that I\'d play a different game. Its annoying and i avoid those levels. Ruins the whole experience of zoning out.',
       'At higher level your game cheats and screws you out of moves. Because of this I am just going to uninstall.  I have been on the same level for over 2 months now. If I use a boost it either uses it for me or force as me to use it off the bat. THIS GAME IS GARBAGE!!!!!!!',
       'This game clearly cheats to make it so you won\'t win a level until THEY want you to win. Annoying AF',
       'I love this game . but sometimes it gets to hard to play. But I keep at it, and play on until I win the level. Ha . please give more than 5 eelives. Cause it goes to fast with only 5. I dowaun loaded candy crush saga , and candy crush soda . love those  games too.  Thank you for making these games. About the only games I play. Lol' ,

Please help to filter all the afk player. Give more penalty to them beside just a minus 5 point. Its nothing. Please ban his next 2 game. Or more heavy..please please and please',

Just A Few Things You Guys Could Work On. 1)I Hope That You Guys Will Let Us BE ABLE To Sell Hereos And I Bet Others Agree. 2)I Also Hope You Guys MAKE IT EASIER For Us To Get BP\'S I Really Really Hope You Guys Get To Fulfill My Request!

       'Not enough with unskippable tutorials now you want us to level up till lvl 8 to be able to change account? Here\'s some suggestion, make a button just before the tutorial, for login purposes for those who have old accounts. I mean, people sometimes reset their phone and you want us to play till level 8 again just so we can play old account? Be realistic developers.',
       'Being Honest this game hasnt really been up to date with others competitors. One thing I think would be lovely is a training camp/single player bot practices to do with new heros. Maybe a small revamp to the art style like 5% realism. And to decrease the amount of gold heros cost, really turns down the tone to play more for new heros',
       '"Nice Game" I been playing this for 3 YEAR\'S and i have some suggestion that will improve this game."Can someone FIX the bug from ROGER the new update effect ROGER\'s game. When i\'m playing and the update is so cool but when i use ROGER it gone wrong!!." suggestion can you add a Credits Score to those who do AFK it was so irritetable. And LAST SUGGESTION can you FIX some CANCER PLAYER\'S. JOKE!!!✌',
       'Please try to develope a new system for Ranked Match such as a proper win rates or some how a proper gameplay for a higher ranks. Because I always paired up with lots of low skill level player and when I\'m at Epic - Legend rank still teamed up with those kind of player. And also please make a heavier and more strict punishment to who being AFK in the middle of the game like ban them for like 7 days from playing ranked match or those who frequently AFK are needed to complete 10 wins in Match Up Mode in order too play Ranked Match again. Please consider. TQ.' ,

       'The trace should b continuous. Stoping and joining the Trace is not good. It should with flow. Will uninstall if not updated.',
       'Amazing app for toddlers. My 2 girls LOVE it. I like how after they say each letter they sound out the letters. And for the other section where the "a is for apple" i think it should be the whole alphabet instead of just a few selection of letters. Because some times the letters repeat.. Like they\'re learning on just letters j or a.. Etc. Idk if you understand me or not. Oh well just my opinion but THANK YOU Also, for those of you saying it has bugs or its very glitched. CHECK YOUR CONNECTION. most of the time when that happens its because either your phone is sh** or you have bad service. Get on that WI-FI' ,

      'I was very surprised  at the diversity of things you can do. And you can speed up EVERYTHING MANUALLY. Ads are optional with selective rewards of either money or one of the three materials you use to build stuff with. The exclusive currency can be bought with irl money or exchanged for materials or in-game cash. Not like any tap game I\'ve ever played, I\'m very impressed! This is a keeper!',
       'This is the best tap games out there. It really loves up to its word saying to timers, unlike SimCity and just about every other game out there. Its easy to play and advance so it sets a wide age range. I would like to personally thank the devs for coming out with this game, something a was looking for for a while. 10/10. Keep up the good work!',
       'Absolutely excellent! I love the freedom of building whatever you like within reason. One thing that could improve it, and it might just be me thinking this, is that the buildings look different as you level them up. I do know that they look different at level 5, but at other levels it would be great, so you remember what level a building is. The idea that each building looks different, regardless of the type of building is still awesome, because it adds a slight feeling of difference and uniqueness. For example, I have come across at least 3 types of apartment and office, so my city/town doesn\'t all look the same. Keep up the good work! 👍',
       'I adore this game, it\'s such a time waster (in a good way)! I wish that the camera controls were compatible with wireless mice. only reason being is because I broke my screen and I can\'t use too much touch screen. :( apart fro',
       'Absolutely love this game, its customisable and you make your city however you want to. One thing I eould like to see is alternative buildings, like instead of a power plant, a hydro plant. Also plz add buildings that can go in the ocean like bridges. Overall love it',
       'It is true that there is no timer but instead your energy runs out very fast! At the end it takes too much time to build a real city!  Also has nothing innovative comparing to other games.' ,

      'I love that I can play as often as I want.    It isn\'t like other games that make you wait a few hours to play again.  I\'m happy with the win/lose ratio.  This game is very addictive.  I also want to add that people complaining the game isn\'t completely free... it\'s just like any other game on play store.  If you want better odds on getting rare cards, then yes you can purchase them, but you don\'t have to spend any money if you just want to be patient and earn them by playing.  Come on people if you want to start off owning rare cards from the begining then support the developer and buy them.  Otherwise have fun and play your way to better cards.',
       'Pretty fun game ... But one thing that\'s REALLY getting on my nerves is the fact that I almost ALWAYS roll low when battling at a camp. Out of my last 40 battles, I rolled a 4 or below 36 times. Doesn\'t sound like a random roll of the dice to me.',
       'getting lots of bugd n no good rewards always getting higher level players as opponents please fix the problem n also not able to watch videos for card claims and free bags as winning rewards. Thanking you',
       'Deserves 5 stars but when the bags slots are full u dont get the bag. I had my all slots full and after doing a match and winning it. I saw there was diamond bag next. So I used my gems to free a slot by opening a bag thinking I will get the diamond bag again but I got a bronze bag. So u need to fix this when we have our slots full then u should keep the same bag that is in the cycle. Otherwise its gr8.',
       'I have never left a bad review. But this game frustrated me to the point that I\'m leaving my first one. Initially, it seemed like a good game for a time filler, but as soon as I spent money on it the matches stop loading. I tried to write to support, and they have an entire circus of hoops to jump through just to submit a request. Definitely not worth your time, I would skip it',
       'Always problem in connection to server.. spoil my middle of game can u fix this? My data internet no problems.. but u server mybe.. fix this and I give full rate star' ,

      'REMOVE TANKS AND ARMOURED SUVS   The game is amazing. All the guns are balanced but there is one big problem... It\'s the TANKS and the SUVS   or make it a banable offence because all people do is camp in the last circle with a tank or a suv. Please fix this and I will rate 5 stars. And I know this is meant to be a minecraft version of pubg but pubg never had tanks or armoured suvs so please fix it. And is it just me but some of the players feel like bots. 😂',
       'Problem I have is that it promotes multiplayer use, but you cannot tell who is an actual player or an AI, there is no chat system like it says, and half of anything it talks about is unavailable in the game. The concept itself is great, the game itself is a great time waster, but I have to call it out on its false advertisement.   Now, if I may have been mistaken, someone please correct me, but so far as I can see there is nothing in the game that suggests multiplayer capabilities.',
       'This game is so fun! I didn\'t expect it to be so good. I imagined that this would be like any other game remake, you know, a lot of glitches, bad graphics, and very high sensitivity. But, to my surprise, it was not like that at all. It was better than expected. I\'m going to be playing this game for a long time. I\'ll tell you that much!   This game is an instant🌟🌟🌟🌟🌟!!! - Andrew from Roboticfalcon21 Reviews',
       'I think it is very similar to battle ground and has that pixle theme going on. But I would love this game even more if you guys could make a chat where we could talk to other players',
       'All in all good game but only one major proble is too many ads.  Edit : uninstalled because my upgrades didn\'t stayed upgraded it massed up 🖕 my dopamine level.',
       'Way to many ads. Ad to get to homescreen ad to get to waiting area, ad to get to arena. On top of that kept jumping back to homescreen and loading another ad instead of going to waiting area. Uninstalled, a shame because it seemed quite good.' ,

      'I LOVE the Platinum quick hit bc it makes me feel like I\'m in a real Casino. I can\'t go to the Casino often anymore since I have given up on the SCAMMING INDIAN CASINOs so it now takes 3 hrs to drive to a Real GAMING COMMISION REGULATED Casino, so this pacifies me until then. LOVE THE AUTHENTIC SOUNDS!',
       'I play other casino games such as double down casino and slotomania, this is my favorite one but it gets played way less often. I just wish there was a little more to make this game fun. I do not like the fact that the Bonus Wheel payouts are extremely low and the odds are even worse. I believe this game would occupy a bit more of my time if the payouts on the Bonus Wheel were a little more, or the minimum bet at all machines should be lowered. Please consider. Thank you.',

      'Decent game but why are there so many rings? I mean literally I have 1000s and the only thing it seems you can spend them on is upgrading your characters. This nesitates you having other pieces for each character which take ages to get then when you finally have enough of those bits it\'s like 1000 rings to upgrade them... Which is absolutely nothing... Give me something else to spend them on or up the price for upgrading characters... Obviously.',
       'I enjoy the game--very much in the vane of classic sonic racing games, with a lanes mechanic and some mariocart-esque abilities. The micro transactions speed up game play and can help progress your character, but won\'t make up for being a bad racer. Instead of transactions you can often watch ads. Typically, the ads are a fair trade off, but some are nearly game breaking. An Airbnb one is running right now that cannot be exited after watching on my OnePlus 5.  Otherwise, 5 stars.',
       'An addictive game that never gets old. With the unpredictable players and teir upgrades, there is always a challenge. I have a few friends who play this game, and while it\'s fun to watch them, being able to play against them would be amazing. Also, the graphics for me are a bit janky (the device is fairly new) and isn\'t pleasing to the eye. The smoother, the better, like chocolate.',
       '*Sega does it again*  I am really happy about this game! Some may not like it, which could be reasonable, but I love it. It\'s fun, fast gameplay with killer music. I\'m very happy that they made this game the way they did. I was skeptical about it, I\'ll admit, but was very pleased with the results. It doesn\'t have all the super fancy bells and whistles, which is good. It\'s simple menu and play system is very easy to get a hang of. People who played the first, or even the second sonic dash can get the controls down. I am very pleased on how easy it is to get characters and level them up using a simple card style, collect a certain amount to unlock and upgrade, instead of the DREADFUL wheel in Sonic Runners.... *shudder*  Anyway, it\'s a very good game and the only problem I have is I enjoy it too much....',
       'Very enjoyable play on the Sonic Dash formula and the microtransactions aren\'t as obnoxious as they could be. Occasionally get a loading screen bug that necessitates force quitting and restarting. There are so issues with certain sound effects playing even when SFX is muted and when connected to a Bluetooth speaker all sounds play even when muted.',
       'Yeah great game and all but trophy system is unfair. Also a big bummer is that the game keeps crashing, sometimes even before u have entered the game. Cannot start a new match cos you are still racing in a match u never actually even entered. And due to this u now have lost 1 of ur reward star runners goes... Disappointed!' ,

      'Amazing game love it easy to level up and I\'m suprised prehistoric animals can be so business worthy. The Graphics could improve a bit. The main problem I have is that it takes ages to load at the start. One time I timed it and it gone up to 26.56 minutes. I would have only got this game from my jurrasic park and world Dan Cameron.  Or you might know him as Shark blue.  I would hugely appreciate it if Ludia Inc. Could respond to my feedback for an improvement or just application.',
       'The game is fun, especially if you like tycoon type games. The issue is there are too many types of currency that really require purchasing. Difficult to progress without shelling out a lot of cash.  Edit: After spending a few more hours with the game I\'m actually very happy with the game, just takes a little to get over the hump to where things take off.',
       'Best dinosaur game out there. My top 3 favorites are the T-rex, velociraptor, & Prognathodon. Theyre so beautiful. I also like the new update - the Photo mode. Thjs game has also the best graphics. Although, some of the dinosaurs or their details or the backgrounds are not so realistic compared to others also in this game(ex. The thorns of the tyranotitan, etc.). Looking forward for better improvements. Nonetheless, thisgame is great. I appreciate it a lot. Thank you for reviving my childhood love. &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3  Also, I hope you make other dinosajr games like Dinosaurs Sims, or kinda Dinosaur tekken. Well, thats a bunch of memory on my phone and a lot of your hardwork. :D :D :D',
       'This game is a non stop grind for well over a year in order to have anything interesting happen. Otherwise it forced microtransactions down your throat just to get 1 half decent dinosaur you can use for a short time before it becomes irrelevant. For the money your gonna spend on this game to enjoy it just buy yourself an actual console and a AAA game',
       'Graphics are good and the game is addictive. Major money grab though. Always trying to get you to spend.  Character design of the animals are just variations of the same skin (Allosaurus has 2 fingers when they really had 3, same for various other species). Presents fun facts that also aren\'t always correct (Pteranodons were not called Pterodactyls).',
       'I have to login everytime i open, also sometime it says already have permission from fb but then deny login. Chache are deleted as my device keep on cleaning so app download 600 mb of data everyday. Takes a lot tym in whatever it process. Need performance update and these bug fixes for smooth experience than i can rate better' ,

      'So many of the questions are just advertisements in disguise. Most of the questions are way too easy, very boring, and stupid. The range of topics used for questions is fairly narrow. This game is a huge disappointment and doesn\'t really satisfy those who want something that closely approximates the actual TV show and the questions that appear on it. I just started playing this game and I think I am very close to uninstalling it.',
       'The English is terrible, half of the time the questions make no sense. Sometimes two of the four answer options will be the same word and it\'s pot luck if you click the right one',
       'The English questions are written by someone who doesn\'t speak English.  In many cases none of the answers are correct e.g. they ask who driver a F1 car - there is no answer driver - the correct answer is pilot !',
       'Why is it on question of America why not Australia oh that\'s right cos Americans don\'t know much of Australia well I\'m not playing again until there is Australia or England questions thanks good bye',
       'I guess  whowever submits the questions is not a natural English speaking person. Also some of the answers are just plain wrong.',

      'Brilliant game very addictive.. But what do I do with the green arrows in the hourly bonus .. all are saying maxed and have 342 left to upgrade. I no on other versions of this you can upgrade again to 50 and 75 to increase layouts but not on this game',
       'Won big, then took to 0.0  with no wins. The worst waste of time to play a losing  game.  Not fun or enjoyable at all!!!  would I spend money to only lose. If you go to casino, at least you get money, not use less points.',
       'The best new slot game with all the extra things you want each slot challenges you. There are so many different ways to earn free coins, so awesome I play scatter and slots era. Great job Murka',
       'Would be great except they rig the later levels so you can\'t win.  Went through almost 200 crystals and over a billion chips.  The win percentages clearly change within same slots at different levels.  Just tries to hook you then rob you.  Only spend money if you want to lose out.  Shame because it would be awesome if not for that cheap tactic.',
       'The levelling system is annoying. I just want to play slots, not grind through missions. Being stuck to 2 different slots for 30min straight isn\'t fun. Why can\'t we just pick what slot we want from the start? The gameplay, bonus rounds, and free spins are actually quite fun. and the missions are a nice little change but we shouldn\'t be forced to play them. App needs changes in my eyes🖒',
       'Payouts are horrible!! Even worse than scattered slots!! They want you to pay real money for fake money but yet can\'t even give a decent chance of advancing! Also, slots are so slow!! I get tired of waiting for the spins to stop!!' ,

      'Sucks. Ok,so I installed it,started it,and it kicked me off! pls make a new update so where it won\'t glitch and kick people off the game that\'s how u lose people and ur game becomes a lost cause. ..anyway,pls fix and I\'ll give five stars.(btw I can\'t even last through the phone call without getting kicked out of the game.)😡😳😡',
       'Very spooooooooky Great this game is great but you should really try doing an update about the purple guy cause it makes no sense that in SL at the end some one stares at a mirror and purple eyes cone out and the purple guy is the only one in the game who is purple! I don\'t know if that makes sense plus the mini games don\'t match because purple guys death was I n fnaf 3 so who is that person in the mirror? I know I mite be Mike or William Afton William Afton is the purple guy but Mike would make more sense cause  the scooper',
       'I would have given it 5 stars But now since the update none of the Freddy\'s games work on my tablet. I am so glad it happened like this before I went out and bought the game like I had planned to do. I love thee games but now not one of them work on my ellipses 8 which they did at one time. Please fix this',
       'Its ok You should make us reach until the 3rd Night for more fun! :D The game is scary but uh..., you should really need to make FNAF 4! Good luck! Note: To complete the game, keep looking at cam. 9 and 11, if Toy Bonnie is gone, go to party rooms, if Toy Chica is gone, go to cam. 7, if Toy Freddy, dont worry! Make sure to check the vents!',
       'So scary. Good game. Look this game will scare you until you pee on yourself aka if your 11 and under like me should play if your not scared but,this game is good. I give it 5 stars no doubt. Lol but hurry up and come out with part 3 already plz!😀😀😀 F.Y.I always wind up the music box',
       'Best horror game in years! Can\'t  wait until I have enough money to buy the full version! Can you please add the random death mini games to the game. I don\'t know if they come with the full version or not... If it does not... I\'m getting the computer version. Please add them and I would like to play at least to two nights to play on the demo. If they did add two nights... I did not see that yet. -itoly256' ,

      'I really liked the action scene where the ICE police arrested the mommy and took her children into social services. I do believe giving an emergency C-section for an illegal is a bit much for a story line, but whatever. Totally makes sense. I love how we\'re able to take care of the premies and foster them until they\'re adopted! 6/10 - Would play again if bored.',
       'Well when I every part was doing just fine but then when I put all the things and it had something point when I posted it didn\'t work so I deleted it I did at first give it a good rating but now I want to change my reading and that\'s why I\'m doing this I said who did it all through my reviews so I hope every everyday everybody out there don\'t waste your time playing this game😐😐😐😐😐😐😑😑😑😑',
       'It sucked the mother getting arrested we having to take care of it is all a lie and it was like the worst game ever it could take you four minutes to play literally',
       'This game\'s control quality is terrible and I even started to get frustrated because the game wouldn\'t let me do something I needed to do to advance.',
       'This game is boringgggg you barely have anything to do and the mommy does not go to jail for child pretectant services the people that commented just lied for people to download it!!!',
       'This game is good I liked it also not so many adds are there  and the part I like the most is that the dressing of the babies.if looking for a game like this please download it. Thanks' ,

      'This is a very good game,  I know there are a lot of ads so I just turn on airplane mode. However on My phone there is another set of numbers between the hundred thousands and millions. For example it will say I have 221,444 K, and I will hit a ball and get 30,927, then it changes to 211,474 K, but my next upgrades cost 1,846 million, and that is literally impossible to reach with it doing this.',
       'Way to many adds just like everyone else has said. 2 swings and an ad. I dont mind the ads at the bottom but every other swing an ad pops up. The game itself is great which is why i gave it two stars but come on guys cool it with the ads. Downloaded 10 minutes ago and i already want to delete this game',
       'Ok Voodoo, the ads, are ridiculous. Yes, we all understand that you need ads to run as a company but 2 swings in and I get a full on 30sec ad. And every 2 swings after that, ad. Horrid. It ruins the gameplay. I wouldn\'t be surprised if someone else used the mechanics of all your games and actually make it playable version of it with reasonable ads in between. Listen to the people who are commenting for one Voodoo. EVERY SINGLE GAME YOU RELEASE HAS THIS STUPID ISSUE. Until this gets fixed, I forsure am going to never recommend a Voodoo game ever again, just because of the ads.',
       'Too many ads I mean I know games have ads but this game has eay too much. Everytime I finished hitting the ball anotjer ad comes up and it gets annoying so im going to guve the game a 1 star.',
       'Okay.  So you might as well hit double up and watch the ad for the double reward on every swing, because every single swing after that ball stops you\'re gonna watch an ad anyways.  But don\'t try to buy ad free mode.  Last time I bought ad free mode on a voodoo game they took my money, refused to give me ad free mode, and will not respond to my customer support emails, so save your money.',
       'The game is (AD) really fun but (AD) Kinda addictive, (AD) It\'s a great (AD) time killer.  Great for road (AD) trips and great for litt(AD)Le kids, 6.5/10 would recommend  (AD) to you if you like ads every 5 seconds.... just one think I don\'t like, all the ads.... look I know that\'s how you make money on here but you would make more with the x2 money thing after the ball lands, I think I\'ve spent more time watching ad forcefully then playing the game, I would watch the ads for the ingame money but I already watched 4 before I swing the bat' ,

      'Well I downloaded it the other day and the app doesn\'t even get past 10% off loading app. Not exactly a good way to start out as a first time gamer for this game. Especially since I saw it in one of my other games saying to download it and get to a certain level and will receive 230 gems from the game I saw it advertised in. If the game does end up working since I uninstalled and reinstalled it just now! So if the app works and is actually worth playing i will change my rating',
       'Update: Since updating the game it doesnt force close as much but still does. Challenge 7 is impossible. Dont have enough time to complete the level. Please make easier for a higher rating. Its incredibly fruatrating when you use half your trophies on a level that is impossible to beat.   I used to love this game but lately it has been force closing and Ive been losing alot of things in the process. Ive spent my own money on the game so itd be great if this issue was fixed cuz I really do enjoy the gameplay.',
       'Personally I think this game is amazing, but it takes far too much time for dragons to sleep! I can understand 5-10 minutes but 20? Not so much. Normally this wouldn\'t be too much of a problem but the minutes only count if the app is open and you\'re playing it, theres nothing even remotely entertaining to do when your chalice is empty and all of your dragons are asleep. Now by no means am I a patient person but I feel like 20 minutes is too long to wait sitting there',
       'I am absolutely in love, and addicted to this game!! My favorite part is definately the holiday/special events. My only criticism is how long it takes to gain back a chalice. Especially when the levels start to require 3-5 per attempt. I know i\'d be playing a lot more if they generated just a little quicker! But otherwise the dragon\'s are adorable, and just the entire concept is really awesome!',
       'Instead of matching 3 shapes, this matches 3 of an object. Haven\'t seen another one like it.   Its hard to put down!! Being able to play parts of it offline is awesome. But this game eats ur battery so be ready. The valentine dragon is so adorable.  I just wish it was easier to get more. Only issue I have is that the controls are touchy especially if you have big fingers. Other than that i love it.',
       'I went from giving this a five star to a three star. It\'s  great game to play. But for whatever reason it\'s stopped "saving" my progress. Spent three hours playing today, only to come back to it and see I didn\'t have any off the stuff I did..thought it was a fluke so I played a bit more and then turned off the game, turned it back on and it again didn\'t have the stuff I did. At this point as much as I like the game I\'m most likely going to uninstall until this is fixed.  Update. Put down to a one star because it still keeps restarting my progress.' ,

      'This is LITERALLY the only casino game that punishes the players who level up or who make an in-app purchase. You are charged more for anything when you level up and the algorithm is noticeably more difficult after you make an in app purchase. This is the absolute LAST time ill play this game. Ive given it chance after chance. If I knew how id try to get verifiable proof that the algorithm changes.',
       'If you don\'t pay cash. You spend most of your time waiting forever for letters from spinning. I waste more time waiting than I get to play. Let\'s make a game for people that can\'t afford to throw money away.',
       'I do actually enjoy this game, however the more you bet the quicker the in game tile meter and level xp should increase, but this rarely happens i can bet £1,000 and it will rise by 10% each time, but then i could up my bet to £50,000 and tile meter will only fill 1% or stop completly! i have tried closing the game and when i open it again i will the get the spinning reel tile bonus a pop up a few times but i never recieve the tiles! instead of money grabbing and putting out more slot machines to play, make sure what is already established actually works properly!',
       'Very addictive but if you get on a winning spee it cheats.  Multiple times I have spun a normally winning spin and it doesn\'t pay out.  The next time I spin that same combo I get a payout.  Has other glitches in accumulation of earnings for letters.  Doesn\'t always  add to it.',
       'I enjoyed the game but was annoyed with the loud notifications that popped up even after I turned off the notifications in the app. What was even more frustrating was the time of the notifications. They often chimed very loudly at 11pm at night and in the past it had woke me up because I had forgotten to turn off my phone volume before going to bed. This game wasn\'t worth the annoyance.',
       'The games are mostly locked up. Rarely are they open to all. Hard to win challenges, because they don\'t give you tiles necessary to win.  I really love this game, but it is a chore trying to play, when they fight you at every turn. EVERY time you make a play, you have to wait forever for it to reload, to make another play, etc. Why is this? Such a pain, but it is addictive, so I keep on, hoping this problem, might eventually be fixed.' ,

      'Love the game & love watching kwelbol. Hope to win the $1000 bcuz the game is simple. But my only question is, is it different on ios, Android & PC? I notice how in the video the character is able to keep rolling face down or the blocks move. Also in lvl 10 the first one falls. I figure how to pass the first 3 parts but it still bothers me how my guy doesn\'t roll like in the video. When I die its instantly puts me back  & its not even a sec and im back at restart. Great game thoe☆☆☆☆☆',
       'I think it has potential to grow but the game breaks on level 10 because you cant get around the wall with the second you get to jump around it and then jump breaks so instead of this being a 30 second level make it a little longer from the start to make it possible. It also is WAY too sensitive on controls.',
       'There\'s not too much wrong with the game. But I started playing level 10 to see what is was like and after smashing into the wall for a while my jump button stopped working R.I.P. also the app asked for 4 permissions: contacts, location, make and receive calls, and access files on your device. The game required none of these permissions though, so if you could remove them that\'d be great.',
       'Kweb, I expected this gane to be FUN. The controls are way to sensitive and the respawn concept is comfortable. The game has RageQuit written all over it. I love you man but this game really is a major setback. And I have no idea about what\'s wrong with level 10. Have you played it yourself kweb?',
       'Good effort for your first game, level 10 is probably more realistically possible from a pc but definitely think it\'s possible with practice. I think there\'s a gap to add shooting or an attack to the game? I\'m guessing the orange character is based on you so possibly a green and or red avatar for some bad guys to attack?',
       'Awesome game jordi!!!!!  But one issue the controls are WAY to sensitive. 😯😯😯 Don\'t get me wrong jordi is fire♨♨ But on level 3 it is really hard I beat every one until nine on PC and phone but level ten is impossible with these controls. BTW love your videos.  Keep it up' ,

      'Overall... I\'d have to say it\'s a very basic game and I wish there was more to it. I have always loved the Simpson\'s and playing a game based on their life is surely interesting. However, I was hoping that it would be more realistic, fun and free. It turns out that it\'s a P2P game and that took my surprise because it really is unfortunate. I hope they improve the gameplay and graphics. More updates will definitely bring more players.',
       'I used to give this a 5 star rating but at level 150 I maxed out the amount of items I can have in my Springfield. Playing the game at this stage is pretty useless. I\'m not a hoarder, my Springfield is beautifully arranged so there is no way I will delete things in order to build new houses or place new items. Will come back when the cap is increased but for now I\'m sadly forced to take a break.',
       'Last update has made it difficult to play. I have a large town and been playing for a long time (lvl130), tap radius has gone down to minimum when I have the IRS maxed. Clicking on finished job character doesn\'t goto them. Emailed EA using link in here and no response just some canned answer. Hoping this will be fixed otherwise I\'ll stop as it\'s taking up to much of my time trying to clear everything.',
       'Crafted a straight trench & boom my crafty points disappeared The IRS radius shortened, clicking finished jobs doesnt redirect me to the Toon player. Train tracks cant be crafted anymore. The Claw machine gives Bowling shoes WTH. Maka Sprungfuld gret agan!',
       'Great game for Simpsons fans. But what kills the fun are constantly new side missions. Just as you finished one, two new shows up. You can never concentrate on what\'s most important and that\'s building the Springfield but rather playing with some ruffians at the time now.',
       'Guys please just take the game back to what it was. Ironheights jobs are all gone, the collection radius i had increased is also gone and this is on top of everything else mentioned here. Testing the software before release seems a good thing to consider next time.' ,
    recentChanges: 
      'It’s a battle for the ages! Wait, we mean a battle of the ages – kids and adults are at war in Springfield! But what could cause this generational divide – Unfair bedtimes? Too many vegetables? Territory rights to the town’s new playground? (That last one was so specific it has to be true). Can Bart lead the youths to victory over Homer’s aged army and claim Springfield’s new Mega Playscape?',
       'Gather your troops, fortify your structures, and see saw your seesaws. It’s time for war.' ,

      'The game is fun. I\'ve seen a couple of others say, that in the time challenges, you have to hit the opponent again, even once they\'ve hit 0 HP. That doesn\'t make any sense.  Also, I can\'t play PVP, it won\'t let me create a user name, it just loads until I have to force close the app.  Why is there a login with Facebook option, if that doesn\'t sync your progress across all devices?',
       'I would like to share the only problem I found with this game. When I made a purchase from the store it gave me a receipt but I\'m not happy as when I went back onto the game my purchase was not there I contacted Google Play and they had to give me a refund I would like to make this problem known and hopefully the game developers can fix this. My transaction wasn\'t complete due to the game lagging on me apart from this one problem I would like to congratulate this game as I found this game just absolutely amazing it is a great game and I also find it amazing that the robots are like the robots from the actual film thank you.',
       'If you guys can help me then I\'ll rate it five stars. OK so basically I just got the game and I have just opened the game but in the middle of the screen is a message saying that there is an amazing new update and when I click update it brings me to play store but there is no update button or update only the open and Uninstall button which is really annoying because I want to play your game.',
       'Would be 5 Star all around if you actually fought real people. Fighting someone\'s robot with Ai isn\'t PvP. It\'s pve still. So technically it\'s fake advertisement.',
       '-_- you have to wait too long to play man, I didn\'t even encounter a single add since playing the game but the waiting for me to play, made me sleepy... Its like watching an add but its only a picture of stages(bronze, silver, gold, platinum, elemental) I\'m not a very patient person and I\'m sorry for that.',
       'I really enjoy this game and overall it\'s one of the best games out there. I  do have a few problems such as glitches and AI is to hard. Keep up the good work!' ,

       'One of, if not the best, free mobile games out there. Visually enchanting, clean and simple gameplay, and tight controls. All ads are entirely voluntary and not at all necessary in order to progress or enjoy the rest of the game. The music and sound design are flawless. This is what mobile gaming should be.  Edit: I\'m unfortunately forced to edit my review as I\'ve upgraded to an LG V30 and the game now crashes regularly during gameplay. I hope a compatibility update is patched in soon or instructions given for improving reliability, as I really enjoy this game quite a lot.',

       'One of my favorite games ever. One of my favorite things about this amazing game is that it\'s simple. There are so many games that are so confusing and with so much stuff, but this game is simple. My favorite things in the game are: 1. The music 2. The graphics 3. The Gamplay One of my beloved things about the game is that it offers so much more like Merchandise, Photo Mode (where you can take a Photo when you want to; you pause the game and take a photo anytime you want), Portraits and so much more!  This is such an Amazing game and I think that\'s it\'s Underappreciated. Good luck in your following game: Alto\'s Odessy! (I wish you\'ll make the Alto\'s Odessy the same chip in the corner of the A and the O)',
       'All-around my favorite mobile game ever. If you\'re looking for an excellent offline timewaster, this is the game for you. It\'s a long game with devilishly tricky goals, but nothing impossible. I recently unlocked the last character, and I\'ve enjoyed every one of the many hours I\'ve spent playing this game. There isn\'t much story, but it\'s perfect in every other way. It\'s also really battery-efficient, as it\'s a 2d (runner?) game with a good zoom distance, so the graphics don\'t NEED to be perfect to give them a crisp, clean, polished look. You can also customize options to what best suits you. 11/10 would play again.',
       'This game is unbelievably stunning.  Everything about it just sets you at ease, the graphics, the music, the gameplay.  This is by far the best game I have ever played, and I\'ve played a lot of them. What you do in this game is you go down a hill and try to catch llamas.  You jump over rocks, do flips, ride on flag lines (I think that\'s what they\'re called)and catch your llamas.  There is also a zen mode which is my favorite.  The music is absolutely beautiful and relaxing, and the graphics are simple, but on the best way.  I can\'t describe in words how beautiful this game is.  If I could, I would give it 10/5 stars!🙃' ,

       'I just wanted to play Tetris. Happy to pay for it, was hoping I could pay a $5-10 purchase price and then have the game and play it to my liking. No, need to join the T Club (who comes up with this) and pay an ongoing fee. It\'s TETRIS from the 80s, EA must you milk everything. Nothing is sacred',
       'When I saw that EA took on the game I immediately purchased it thinking it was any good. The graphics are good, but the controls are nerve-wrecking and the game makes decisions for you. It responds slowly and the block hold works by itself. These little things make you lose and make the game unplayable. Don\'t download it - free or not, look for another Tetris because this does no justice to the original',
       'Great game, but there\'s an annoying window that pops up everytime I try and start a new marathon. The window is pretty much useless and wastes my time. Would give this 5 stars if it gets patched',
       'Since you really really want a review, when I adjust music and SFX to minimum, I expect no sound at all. Please allow for sound to be muted. Very annoying to have button that serve no purpose. Sure you need ads to survive EA big company like you, go ahead but you want to play the ad with sound over what I have playing that\'s annoying enough, at least optimise the sound so that it doesn\'t play at max volume.' ,

      'The movement and the ability to delete structures for refund could be better. Trading HQ could be so much better, my main concern are the loading screens. Perhaps instead of loading the whole city a separate map viewer could be opened that shows general statistics and layout but not the entire city. That way trading could be done faster between cities and there would be more involvement with the trading community. As it stands its a real chore and is deterring me from trading as much as I\'d like. Another idea is if the stock market could be integrated somehow. I think that would be cool, and it would add an element of realism.',
       'The more stuff is added the lagier it gets. Game freezes when buying items, when going over your city, with the chat, loading the flobsl trade, travelling to other cities and basicly everything nowadays. Requires multiple restarts of the game and reboots of my phone regularly to keep jt playable nowadays. It used to be really good and smooth, but it only gets worse each update and no improvement in sight. I only play now because I made some good friends in my club, but the actual fun is long gone. :(',
       'I get this little freeze ounce in a while but thats fine. But something that should be changed is that the factories should have workers to do it for you instead of us clicking it everytime. Put like a auto make bittom on there and we can build it like that. On the other side the game in 97% fine.AKA Awesome!',
       'This is a great game,very addicting, but can you please fix the glitch that makes everything either too big or too small. The contest of mayors screen doesnt even show up  only shows up one third. Will rate higher once this is fixed, its very annoying',
       'Game is basic in its features. The worst part of the game is the trade hq. Rather than letting you buy directly off the hq menue you have to load the other players city. If your phone doesnt load it as fast as someone else they can snipe the goods you need to buy.',
       'Great game!!! Would love coins for basic production items but they are not necessary for this game to be great. Also maybe if there were rewards for club donations back and forth more lol would do it. Thanks for providing really great entertainment :)' ,

       'Great game, some hard levels which are challenging enough to make it interesting.  Update: loving the new updates recently! Refreshing the skirmish rewards makes it better now. Enjoying the latest update with the new sniper events.  Really looking forward to the new campaign episodes!! Awesome!',
       'I just started playing this game and I can already see that I\'m going to love it. Not had any problems and everything is easy to use. The graphics is 5 stars as well as the game play. If U like shooting games U should definitely try this one. Thanks for putting together such an awesome game app. 👍👍',
       '.IAll around amazing game, BUT IT JUST DELETED MY PROGRESS. Coming back, progress still deleted and customer support didn\'t even finish the conversation to fix it. They just decided f*** it and left me to dry. Apparently according to a reply it was fixed but I only got back one of my weapons and am still missing characters and a gun(gentleman, Rose Kitty, M4A1-Z and my AK) in actuality looking and reviewing my profile again nothing was fixed.(to the replier I don\'t know how replies work) Also it even shows all of my gunners using the ak-47 and auto picks rose Kitty and such as if they are my selected and owned character and all my cards are reset even though I\'m in the third chapter of campaign so yes, campaign progress was saved but nothing else. WHY?',
       'what the fcuk? good game but how dare you transfer my points for character and weapon to money, tell me like  you don\'t have it anymore but you still use points in black market',
       'New update said zombies was back but not there at all. But otherwise the best shooting game ever and super high end graphics.' ,

      'The app keeps crashing and I keep losing my progress. Not to mention that when I finish playing a stage in story mode, it asks me if i want to biy the character i already bought and am pkaying with. If I say no then it closes story mode and I lose my progress. Also I can\'t turn and hot opponents smoothly. Feels too robotic as you have to stop attacking in one direction and wait for the character to turn and then only you are allowed to hit the enemies on that side.',
       'I like this game, can the enemies have names and can there be a place where you can see them without them moving or attacking you The storyline is a little unclear can there be a recap thing as well please And do tell me how I am supposed to take 2 of those bull things at once!',
       'The best game I have come across in a while. However, because it glitches me out of the game completely, it\'s frustrating and annoying as you loss valuable progress in the game. Wish the creators did something about it as it would make the game even more popular.',
       'GAME is too easy as i complete it in just a two days.So you should add one more arena for challenge which is tough to becomes get complete.And that new hero is not too much powerful than the lightning blade.so,in coming new update the new hero has much more powers',
       'The bosses in this game are overpowered and the first boss should not shoot a laser for that long amount of time. There are a bunch of holes and chances to fall to your death in this game which is stupid and shouldn\'t even happen. So yeah I hate this game',
       'The game is fun it has a great balance between platforming and fighting but there needs to be a boss run and there needs to be a vs mode were you play against somebody online or you can have teams like 2 vs 2 but this game is a 9/10' ,

      'It\'s a fun relaxing game. Its so addictive that every device I have, must have this game. I have it on my phone, ipad and tablet. Except my laptop cuz then I would get no work done. About the ads, one pops out each time you finish a game, so I\'m not to bothered by it. Also, theres no videos too watch in order to earn coins or diamonds because none are needed. I just love it. Its stress free.',
       'I really enjoy playing this game. It helps me to relax while I am watching TV, or even using in split mode while watching a video or something. It\'s a bit different then the way I originally used to play Klondike, but still a great game and easy to get used to quickly! I don\'t mind the 5 second or so ads between games. It\'s the price you pay to get a good, free game. It\'s not like they play constantly and during a game there is usually an ad on the bottom screen but it will quickly move if you go to start a new game or need to access the other options.',
       'I would have scored higher except there is suddenly super annoying music being played that there is no option to turn off. The ads also now autoplay loud music. I agree with another poster who said it starting to seem like you lose more so you see more ads. I liked this because it was good for a quick game while getting ready to sleep. The music ruins this. I\'m going to try another app now.',
       'I love the game solitaire played it on many different computers over the years. Downloaded three other version on my phone. All of which I deleted almost straight away because they were finicky and I didn\'t like the format. This one is easy to use and no glitches. So far so good.',
       'It won\'t allow me to add my own pic for background. Maybe too big of a file but I know other solitare let me. I also wish there wasn\'t commercials after the win or lose because they interrupt my music but I hear you guys make money that way so let it be. I\'ll continue to play because I like solitare and the commercials only pause my music and don\'t cut it completely off to play the commercial, like other apps.',
       'Terrible ads. So bad they hid the menu bar behind an ad banner so you click the ads just to access settings. Pretty sure they recently increased losing deal rate to make more ad videos play. So many other solitaire aps available so skip this one.' ,

      'I love this game, it\'s really fun. The only thing I wished was that when the characters level up, it actually does something more than raise their health. Like, increase stats in the place their working, or increase production. Maybe not every level, but there should be more benefits to leveling up. When bringing wastelanders back, let\'s say they are gone for an hour and you start to bring them back, when you get to ten minutes before they get home and put them back to exploration, they shouldn\'t jump back to where they started, from an hour. Idk. But I love the game.',
       'This game is so very exciting to play. As an avid fan of nearly all Bethesda games, this is a great mobile representation of their Fallout Universe. The gameplay is enticing and there is always something new around every quest; however it should be noted every quest storyline has variance, the quest gameplay is similiar between all. Comparing your dwellers from the beginning to a week into the game and there is a sense of accomplishment. The customisation of the dwellers and vault rooms is satisfying. The only thing I would add that isn\'t already presented, would be multiplayer. A way to send dwellers or explore eachothers vaults. If this option exists, and I just don\'t see it, I apologize.  Great game. Love to play.',
       'I really enjoyed this game but upgraded phone from s5 to note 8 and can\'t get my old game save back. Tried to follow steps and load from cloud but nothing loads. Wouldn\'t really care about starting over so much if I hadn\'t spent money on the game. Hopefully developer helps me out. I can screen shot order history to verify in game purchases if need be.',
       'Fallout shelter is a fun, beautiful quick game you can keep coming back to. For me fallout shelter is one of my most favorite games on mobile and keep coming back to even after over a year of playing it. They keep updating it to. There are plenty of things to collect as well as people u might know from the other fallout games. Really really fun and love the cartoony graphics as well as the easy controls. Great to kill time',
       'Fallout Shelter has to be the best games out there. The concept, graphics, etc. Is really great! Although, great games can\'t be perfect. But, I hope these suggestions could make it close to perfect. First off, clicking on the Mysterious Stranger, Bottle, Cappy, etc. Can be difficult sometimes, missing the rewards they give. Second, please make the game a little less challenging. By that, maybe an easier way to get pets and lunchboxes. Other then that, great game. Keep it up!',
       'Love this game!  Needs a little refining of the interface to help manage dwellers more easily. Gear inventory listing by attribute would be nice and should also show equipped items to facilitate swapping. Access to character window from each facility window would help with gear and dweller assignment. Load times are long and cause occasional crashes. All of these issues are palatable because the game it\'s so strong.  Still playing as is because it\'s nicely balanced, thank you!' ,

      'So I\'ve won around 100 battles so far. Enjoying the game. Ready to see where this game is taken. I feel updates could make this unto the best mobile music game on the playstore. It\'s nice to always be able to recharge your stamina through ads. I hope updates come and also limited decals. One drawback and a fix needed is losing the stuff you paid for when you change the item.',
       'What happens when you miss a note??? NOTHING. the song keeps playing perfectly so what then is the point of playing the game correctly if there is no penalty on the song quality? No point besides screen shaking smh. Make it like the console version where you hear a bad note.',
       'Game is really fun. The ads for other game aren\'t cool if you let your kids play the game. Especially it having an E rating. That is unacceptable. I understand ads is why it\'s free  but don\'t have 14+ rated game ads for an E game. Glad I didn\'t let my kids play this yet',
       'I\'m having loads of fun with this game. That said, the frequent crashes after games and the addition of an energy system, which has absolutely no place in a multi-player game, makes it so I can\'t give it more than three starts in its current state.',
       'Eh. It\'s decently made but the faux versions of songs are weird. I\'m not even sure how they can legally use them as they\'re each a  blatant ripoff if someone else\'s music.',
       'Love the game. But inform understand how I can keep getting 100 percent and losing by 3 or 4000 points.   And. Why is it. Certain times of the day I win. A lot. And some times of the day I lose slot.  She. I win its always against the same person and they get the exact same score.  And don\'t use the pedal.  Just seems weird to me.' ,

    description: 'How to become a Millionaire? Very hard in the real live but not easy in the: Deal To Be A Millionaire. You must think carefully to give a good answer for each round to get the biggest money as you can. The main target gets 1 million dollars.NEWBIE GUIDE:- The game has 16 identical sealed boxes.- There are 16 boxes on the wings each containing an amount of money between 1p and $1 Million.- At the start of the game, the player selects a numbered box at random.- The player’s aim is to sell that box back to The Banker for the most amount of money possible.-The independent adjudicator loads and seals all the boxes. No one but the independent adjudicator knows what is in the boxes.- In the first round, the player must choose five boxes before the first offer from The Banker.- The Banker places his opening offer into the capsule. If the player successfully predicts the opening offer (within 10%) they gain a one-time use of the Offer Button, which can be pressed at any time during the game. When pushed, The Banker must immediately call to make an offer. - MC asks, “Deal or No?” The player must answer, “Deal” to accept the offer or “No Deal” to decline the offer and carry on.- Four boxes are opened in the second, third, fourth and fifth rounds, followed by the question from MC.- If you decide to “No Deal” you will continue in this fashion until only two boxes remain.- If you accept an offer by saying “Deal”, the game is still played out in exactly the same way, in order for the player to see what they could have won if they’d carried on. - When the last two boxes remain, The Banker will give his final offer. If you say “No Deal” you will then go through to the final box opening in live play.

      'Don\'t like games that only let you progress when coins come up. Just took 53 spins x max to reach level 4. No thanx will delete when coins are gone. If any thing second chance and it\'s more pathetic. Bye for the last time.',
       'Fun game! Lots of wins! Not realistic because in real life you can\'t win this much! Hate the bonus and extra games though, constantly spinning faster than normal but rarely ever stopping on bonus or free games',
       'Slots WOW, is a suitable name. Awsome variety  of cool, unique  slot games, where you win incredible  amt. coins in spins,Hugh wins also bonus games,with out betting your entire bank roll,yet wins are huge,free games are more common than in most casinos.Choose your challenge game.',
       'Awesome wins and crazy awesome graphics. This is a game to entertain short or long down times. Once you start playing you almost cannot stop. Great job!',
       'Pros:  It\'s enjoyable when u get something out of it for betting at Max, but doesn\'t always go well and you have to waste 5million or so till u get a Ultra Win and bonuses don\'t come very often unless u either auto or tap it urself and hope it lands on a bonus?   Cons:   Game resets and freezes and you lose either ur gems or another spin at the wheel and or specials that they give u by watching short videos. Doesn\'t always give it to you as like I said freezes or makes you have to close the app and restart all over again.',
       'try as I might. .I just can\'t get ahead in this game. .have spent real $$ and still no joy..not fun at all when u play for 2 minutes before u run out of coins..deleting. .' ,

Anyways but i still love it Ninjago is my  favorite have you guys watch the ninjago movie even there episodes. Thank you for creating this game.👍👍👍👍👍👍',
       'I\'m a big fan of lego ninjago♥. Its just hands of time I fight serpentine and when master Wu spoke I saw a timeblade. When I was chilling looking at my mission\'s then Lloyd hacked into Zane\'s computer he said something I just have a bad memory.',
       'I think if you could add a few extra spaces for more ninja then everybody would be happy .the reason I\'m giving this app a 4 star rating is because you can only have up to five ninja on a mission including your own .if anybody would like that to happen then give this review a thumbs up.',
       'It\'s amazing I love it I like how you can make your own ninja and have any weapons it\'s one of the best games I\'ve ever played I have it on all my devices it always puts my in a good mood a job well done plus I\'ve saw every episode and the movie I\'m a huge fan got lots of the sets (5) stars keep it up',

      'The game itself is fun and good but theres just so many adds and it gets so annoying. Another thing id like to point out, i beat both killer and parkour mode and didnt get an achievement or even a reward. Overall the game disgusts me',
       'This is THE WORST game. There is no tutorial, and no way to know how to properly play. During the starting levels, you can hardy jump which renders lvl2 impossible, forcing you to watch an add to pass it.',
       'Very good game, its the game I\'ve kept the longest as replaying using different techniques and moves is always fun. Ads arent a problem as they only last a couple seconds and can skip. Only wish is that it would update more, only had one update so far and the game came out a while ago.',
       'Too too toooooooooooo many ads. An ads pops up nearly everytime you restart a level. Really annoying. Takes a lot away from this great game.',

      'Good game. Needs a seeding system. Getting bored of being killed by players 10-15 levels above me. Spawn points need looking at too. Keeps respawning at the same point I just died at. There appears to be some hacked players too. Just shot 1 guy 7 times in the head and he took it and shot me back once which was enough to kill me',
       'So many people using modified apk to paly... Very few gamers playing ethically.. makers must do something about it.    New update is not stable.  After Every 5 min. It shows that my wifi got disconnected, though my wifi is already connected. Didnt face any problem like this in Previous version.',
       'When I am in a tank attacking my opponent, it does not hit the opponents tank and the person in the other tank would not respond because I guess they don\'t see me. But the other players not mounting any tank would see my tank and attack it. Also when my opponent is attacking or being attacked by my players it doesn\'t show the opponent\'s location on the map. Please fix this Also can you give us an option of selling weapons which we no longer need?',
       'This game is awesome if i compare with others but it needs improvement if you make exception. Problem is that lack of enough ammunition untill death. Sollution is that you can give ammunition around war places so that we can take and reload ammunition. Tank destroyer luncher has only 3 ammunition but there are so many tanks!! So what i can do? I will kill myself to get ammunition?',
       'This game is an absolute joke unless you spend actual money. I spent weeks EARNING gold coin and tried to upgrade my armor and it failed!! How does my purchase fail?!! And your playing against people with 140% health and crazy armor points so you can\'t kill anyone unless you try to upgrade your armor. Then on top of all that you have people who hack the game and run around killing people with no deaths. Complete rip off.',

      'Don\'t want to play hours of boring levels to get to (hopefully) more difficult stuff. I would have no issue if the levels were at least different from each other. It takes merely 10 seconds to get through the starting levels but there are just too many. It\'s wasteful.',

      'The first time I played I easily got over 800, now I swear the game upped it\'s difficulty like crazy, I can\'t get past the 200s. Not sure if it\'s a bug, an Easter egg feature or what, or if it\'s because I completed challenges but I don\'t appreciate the inconsistency especially when playing against friends and I don\'t feel evenly matched :(',
       'Its a fun game, really, however in my opinion its too easy. I got 150 First try and 346  my second. and maybe consider adding things to unlock like different balls or hoops. other than that its a fun game to kill time',
       'I love it, Fun, Super Easy but makes you want to test your limits everyday. #ByeOtherApps',
       'I like the game and the idea of it, but the only problem I have with it, its the ads. Dear God there is a lot of ads, even when I\'m in the middle of a game, an ad pops up from the bottom. Just try to lower the amount of ads especially on the challenges, I hate to be asked and forced to watch an ad everytime I fail a challenge or complete it',
       'I absolutely love the game the only.problem I\'m having is when I\'m playing I keep knocking the ad advert at the bottom where your thumb goes to move the net and keeps ending game and making me.lose cause of that will change rating if gets sorted',

      'The PvP system is super broken. One game might be played with someone at close to your rank and next you might be playing a player with 20,000+ more trophies than you. And along with that the 2 players aren\'t even getting the same waves of enemies to start with so someone with 8 less rank ups than you can beat you by 35,000+ points. This has only happened to me like 15 times a day so please fix it cause game ain\'t worth playing if PvP is broken.',
       'The game was cool up until you start getting stuck and can\'t level up so the only way to move up you have to spend money to buy coins and hearts. Unfortunately people need to chase money rather than make something cool',
       'Just wondering where my season rewards are I ranked pretty high and it started over but haven\'t recieved anything.  Why is this?  UPDATE: STILL WAITING FOR MY PVP REWARDS FROM A WEEK AND A HALF AGO.  WHAT GIVES?  THIS GAME IS A RIP OFF.',
       'I love how similar it is to "galaxy attack" but on the next level! Even many attack patterns and quick clear tactics seem to be if not the same at least VERY similar :) I\'d give it 4.8 out of 5 stars.',
       'The game is really fun except after watching ads to recieve random benefits, it will close the entire app at the end of the ad and you will not receive said rewards. Extremely frustrating.',
       'Far too many ads.  Company is shady for telling people who complain to "buy ad remover in game".  How is this not extortion?' ,

      'I love the challenging concepts. But in 2 of the levels, there was no way I could work out the clue. You cannot see a hole in the wall in level 9. Not can you figure out the code on drawers in level 11 as the colour shapes are not relevant to anything. I had to go to clue which was disappointinting and still didn\'t follow. Otherwise I would score game higher. A few tweaks would be nice please.',
       'Really impressed with this Escape room! I\'ve tried several others where I don\'t get anywhere, it makes it no fun to play! This one is just hard enough and some easy ones as well that it makes you use your brain & have fun at the same time!!! I\'m basically a beginner and got stumped quite a few times, but eventually figured it out. This is the best escape room app I\'ve played so far! Please make more!',
       'This really got me thinking, I loved the variety in the levels. The only issue is that some levels do have steps that are impossible to figure out as there\'s no connection in the clues. I had to use the videos more than I would\'ve liked. The other issue is that you can\'t save progress so have to start a level from the beginning if you move away from the app.  Overall a really fun game that\'s had a lot of thought put into it.',
       'Well thought out and masterfully crafted. Graphics r pretty cool too. Not a silly seek and find, this is more a.treasure hunt and use your noggin to problem solve. Beyond fun, it is entertaining and you actually feel pretty happy when you figure it out on your own. Stuck? You can watch a video that shows how u can escape and complete the level from start to finish.  Yo u do not have to watch worthless vids to get  any rewards. Creators deserve respect on this game in design, creation, execution with the problems and puzzles you get to solve. Gratifying. Nicely done!',
       'Beat it within a day. You have to have good logic and reasoning skills. This is one of the top escape games going. It\'s not like others where random items open up doors making no sense. It\'s more tomb raider/resident evil type escape puzzles. Great game. Need alot more of this. Good job devs. Goooooood jooooooobbbbb!!!!',
       'I love this game. The adverts are annoying tho. I love the way that if ur stuck u can watch a video to help u. There is 1 problem. This game is a waste of ur time because it only has 12 levels. Once u finish level 12, it asks u to rate it and u dont have a choice not to. Once u have rated it, it sends u back to the game and it makes u start again. But maybe it has just happened to me. Before u download this game, ask a friend that has this game if what i have just told u has happened to them. If it has, then dont download this game. IT IS A WASTE OF TIME!!' ,

      'Certainly has some potential if developed a bit more.Only played 1st 2 missions which were over in less than 30 secs considering Its only a small game. The AI is not good nor control system that great. Still be nice to see what looks like improvements after a few updateds. Keeping a lazy eye on this:-)',
       'I can see through the map in several places and the Enemy and the map itself is very Glitchy.   There is an Extremely annoying rooster crowing throughout the entire gameplay and yeah I could just mute it but why? I shouldn\'t have too!!   Then you can hear when an Enemy sneaks up behind you.  I had an alright time playing it but it\'s Definitely Not a game you\'d wanna spend money on, at least not THIS Version anyway!!',
       'Overall....Great Game, but with Controls of Shooting & Moving around....It\'s Not Exactly Easy to Around. And when it comes to Movement just in General....my Main Problem, But NOT the Only Problem was the Movement in Exactness of where I\'m Trying to Move my Guy (My/the Shooter) just Stinks!! - The Game itself....I Love It!!!',
       'Good game and all but the pictures shown for the view isn\'t what it seems, and this game has some flaws, such as inaccurate hitmarkers. When an enemy shoots from behind me, for some reason, it points to the front, I almost died one time, pressed medkits, I got back up, and I couldn\'t turn the camera for the rest of the game. Also, add the guns that are actually in the pictures... :/',
       'Way way way to many ads. If you want to exit, you cant because an ad keeps popping up. After every mission or round an ad pops up. When you want to change a setting, an ad pops up. Could ne great, instead its the definition of a sellout',
       'Great game.... but difficult for controle on himeself during shooting  you can get killed during shooting by enemies if you will not move to and fro...' ,

       'I thought this game was cool being the only Maori game I\'ve ever played. But like a few other reviews the game kept freezing not allowing me to do anything. The graphics could be better. The ad for this game didn\'t make sense either..',
       'Ka mau te wehi! This is cool and fun. I love how the toa call out in te reo Maori. Also love hearing the native bird calls in the background. It does freeze a bit but still the coolest mobile game I\'ve played by far. Chur',
       'I\'ve enjoyed this game so far especially getting to hear the reo being spoken on a gaming platform like this. Great that this has an option in the reo but it would be better to have a quick change of translation on the Stage selction page and when you are reading tutorials as i think this would engage users in learning some reo at the same time and learn kupu as you go. Secondly it would be great to see more stages develop and even having a unlimited enemies stage/challenge where you test to see how far you can go and compare scores with other users. Thirdly, needs more clear options of what the towers do as they arent named on the selection whilst in-game. Lastly, be great to see slightly better graphics and user ability. No doubt you guys will fix the little freezes this game sometimes has. Heoi anoo, nei raa te mihi nui ki a koutou, ngaa kaiwaihanga, moo te whakawhanaketanga o te keemu nei',

      'The smoke doesn\'t turn off, the cars tend to oversteer a lot, the steering angle is exaggerated,and the campaign seems really barebones. Apart from that all the shopping systems with the chests and everything seem pretty balanced and there\'s a good amount of cars with lots of customization. Also the whole blueprint system is kinda confusing. Hoping to see this game grow more 😊',
       'This is an example of what an app should be. If you even have a passing interest in cars/drifting, download this game. Not only is the online mode a triumph for tandems, the customer support is top notch. I lost all my progress and they sorted my account out so I can enjoy mad tandems again. It may seem a tad grindy at first, but once you get the hang of the controls the game gets a lot better.   Stop reading reviews and download it already!',
       'The game is actually really good. I would recommend it. It\'s fun, the leveling isn\'t hard or complicated. The cars are awesome in game. I had some issues with the first introduction level with the polygons overlaying the display but after that it was okay. (Bug I guess) All in all solid 4 stars from me.  LG K10 2017',
       'Amazing start to a new realistic drift game tho there are a couple of faults: one being that there is no exit button to exit the game and the other being that the steering, even at highest sensitivity, is not sensitive enough. Also I\'m used to using tilt steering but that doesn\'t exactly help with applying opposite lock during drifts. But otherwise I really really really like the game and hopefully these problems will be solved. Great start to a new game!!! The multiplayer is very accurate and no glitching despite my low internet and wifi speed which is remarkable. Almost Perfect!!! 👌🤘👏😉',
       'This game really good. I love it. The cars that costs diamonds are pretty expensive... Just like in CarXDrift there is going to be a lot of grinding to be done in order to unlock more cars but it\'s fun. PLEASE ADD A CONFIRMATION DIALOG WHEN MAKING ANY KIND OF PURCHASE IN THE GAME.  Lots of people are saying the smoke thing does nothing... It does.. It turns off smoke for all cars expect yours so that the game runs smoothly...',
       'Drift Clash is very enjoyable and brings a sense of competitive drifting into the mobile scene. It implements the use of Clash Royale\'s chest system, but still maintains a clear focus on skill rather than luck. Unlike other games  Drift Clash uses more advanced yet simple physics such as countersteering to spice up the gameplay. The chests are also rewarded upon skill, as building drift combos gives a chest. I reccomend this to anyone who enjoys drifting.' ,

      'This is best game . Simple and challenging. Difficulty is too high but I managed to figure the real answers and it became good ovenist but to arrange the pizza very well it needs artistic skills.',
       'Really bad. Some people don\'t even say what they want. Then complain when they don\'t get what they want. Just like working at Little Caesars.',
       'Fun concept, but somewhat repetitive, it takes an unnecessarily long time to make money due to stupid over the top fees, but has a very nice art style, not a game to play and just be done with',
       'I think this is an awesome game and is great for people that love food and challenges!😀😁😛',
       'Well I do what they say but I always go bankrupt it is a good game just frustrating I wouldnt say i hate it because it is a fun game and it keeps me busy however you should change what to pardon because then it is more polite but ovarall it is a good game.',

      'It would get a higher rating if there wasn\'t energy involved. And you pretty much have to pay real money to get weapons. I was hoping you would be able to use the money acquired in the game, but for most stuff you need "gold". Take a long time to aquire gold unless you buy it. I\'m almost done the second region and I think I\'m losing interest. I love to hunt so I was excited about this game but it definitely could be A LOT better. Hope there\'s updates to make getting weapons easier',
       'Awesome game but. It should have that animation effect which shows you the parts of guns while upgrading them. It was so cool in that previous version. In previous version Whenever we upgrade it feels like we are really purchasing the gun\'s accessories. Game is great but as a user almost all will mis this thing... If u wnt to improve ur game than this comment is worth a million for you..  so just go for the fix bro. Best wishes',
       'Awesome updates! I love this game, probably too much. The only problem is for some reason, the app crashes very frequently on my T-Mobile Galaxy S8 Plus. I\'ve cleared the cache and checked for updates to Play Services. If you could look into this further, it would be tremendously appreciated. Otherwise, excellent work, thank you kindly.',
       'I absolutely love this game. The only issue I have encountered is when I tried to play this 2018 version that says its compatible through my Chrome cast device version 2016 displayed on my tv and would not go past the play hunt screen. Please tell me if there is something I\'m not doing right.',
       'This would of got a 4 maybe even 5 stars. If I could still play it. I enjoyed myself and finished the first region on the game, closed it out and came back later and it wouldn\'t let me connect. It just said cannot connect to severs. And I haven\'t been able to get back in. Please fix this. I enjoy this game',
       'It\'s a good game up until you get past the first 2 regions. From then on, in order to play, you have to pay. Very obvious this game\'s main goal it to suck the money out of you, there\'s a popup every other click asking for cash. Make the payments optional instead of required and it would be a good game, but it really sucks when you have to fork out money in order to use an app.' ,

      'The algorithm of the AI mode of the worms is somehow amazing. It seems like a game which is not really amusing your eyes but actually has a good algorithm and programming instead. Rather than the usual games that we play, i recommend you to play this and figure out the algorithm. It maybe easy but sounds exciting if you can find it out',
       'How does one finish speedrunner 1? I tried purchasing a few upgrades as possible. I purchased 2 money upgrades for Jofu, a speed and money upgrade for Cula and Byldo and the 2 fruit teirs. I can\'t obtain Ony before 11 minutes. Maybe one should set the objective as unlock Byldo in 5 minutes instead.',
       'Oh man, this has held my attention almost as long as cookie clicker. It has plenty of extra stuff to keep the gsme fresh, like the challenge mode or golden fruit achievements. Really looking forward to any other additions the developers are planning. Especislly the animated worms, the movement is so smooth.',
       'I love this game for how relaxing it is. One thing I would love would be to be able to move the pens for wash worm around and customise the lay out.  Other then that I feel what ever else this game will throw at me will be just fine. Keep up the good work^^',
       'I have always loved snake when I was young... This combines my love of snake and my love of idle games. Plays when you\'re not around but fun to play when you are playing. Not just taps, not just idle and quick paced with good achievements.',
       'Everything is fun except for the buggy buttons. You press up, the worm goes right. Then half the time the arrows for one worm cage are so small you accidently press into another worm cage and lose all progress.' ,
    recentChanges: 
      '-Achievements for golden fruits can now be obtained, even if the golden fruit Upgrade has been purchased',
       '-Golden fruits now add a visual indicator to the fruits',
       '-The interface can now be enlarged in the main menu (only for devices with problematic resolutions)' ,

      'Stupid game. I spent so much time on it building just for a higher leveled person to come in a destroyed it to point i couldnt rebuild. Not worth time spent on rebuilding things if higher leveled people just continuously attacking lower leveled teams and wiping them out. Only shows u have to have money to play this game to level up to defend. Im not spending a dime on this retarded game',
       'I\'m impressed. This really is a fun game. And with all of the aid, events and rewards there are you really don\'t need to pay to win. There\'s a lot to learn so you may feel a bit lost at first but it keeps the game from being repetitive. I didn\'t think this would be a 5 star game but after 2 weeks of playing I can tell you that it certainly is. A+ 💯',
       'Great graphics and addictive but not alot of explanation on how to do things. Too many updates in short amount of time,  too long of a waiting time on researches. You need to spend money if you want to keep up with the rest and you\'re placed up against players alot more stronger so always have to go protection buffs. Not an even playing battlefield.',
       'A whole lot of effort to get anything done. They\'re constantly trying to sell you things at obnoxious prices and if you don\'t buy them you\'re setting yourself up to be abused by those foolish enough to waste their money on this game.',
       'Really not happy I have spent loads off money over time on buying gold in the game and packs.. I have had major glitches in the game that have made it a waste of my time and money I have lost over 10 advanced teleports on the game and when I contact your customer service team they don\'t even reply to me.  I find this very bad customer service and that all u want to do is take my hard earned money and not even reimburse me what I have lost.i really enjoy playing this game but this is making me want to not play any more',
       'Money hungry is all this game is. Can\'t upgrade buildings unless you spend tons of money. Have never played a game where you can not upgrade by waiting awhile. Don\'t waste your time.' ,

      'Would be 5 stars but I previously purchased the premium bundle (unlock everything) and restoring purchases doesn\'t do anything. This was of course the android version. Funnily enough the option to purchase it again looks like it\'s working. Cannot give any higher than 1 until this glitch which can render your previous purchases void, is fixed.',
       'Hello, I download turbo dismount  purchased the premium version as I am familiar with the game and used to have it on steam. It hasn\'t seemed to have unlocked anything at all. I tried restoring purchases and it hasn\'t done anything. I checked my bank and the transaction has been processed and is pending to come out my account meanwhile I have been left with the standard version of the game and am quite disappointed please help?',
       'After playing this game, I\'ve really enjoyed what it has to offer. The cars are cool, the graphics are fun, and the ragdoll feature is awesome. But it needs so much more. And I have a few badly needed suggestions. First of all, and most of all, a SAVE REPLAY feature and a SCREENSHOT feature. Adding both of these things would improve the game TREMENDOUSLY. Second of all, GRAPHICS OPTIMIZATION. It can get pretty lagged up on some of my favorite levels. And it\'s the same for other people. And last of all, a VR feature. Like for first person camera, there could be VR compatibility. This is not badly needed, but it would be pretty awesome. So, Secret Exit crew, please please PLEASE read this review, and please consider it. These ideas will make the game better.',
       'Mr . frame was in stair dismount and he is my favorite character. Why is he not in this game? Please add him. EDIT: Man, you guys could have added Santa as a new playable character for early Christmas. But a new obstacle is always awesome!!',
       'This app maked me laugh. I love the app. But I want to make a suggestion. Can you add a vehicle customize where you can change the colour and pattern? It would mean the world to me if you could add that! You don\'t HAVE to. Just making a suggestion;). Thanks!',
       'Not as fun as I thought, but still great game overall. Addictive☺ Funny as well because you can customize your own character and vehicle!(use funny images! I did and i laugh all the time!) 4 stars all the way!😁' ,

      'Awsome game. Completed all levels without any hack jzt waited  for hope   ( the lives ) evrbdy shld try this. Sry i gonna uninstall this app only bcoz i finished all levels. Each time when u invite me to rate this app i was thinking that i shall rate this 5 if i win the 75th level. Now iam satisfied.... Great timepass.. Nice tactics, waiting 4 more awsome funny levels. If anybody has any diffrnt opinion cntact me on telegram @chichu  this is my user name. Thnx 4 thiz awsome gift babe.',
       'The game is really interesting and entertaining. The graphics are smooth and and the controls are manageable.   The thing I disliked through my game play is that you don\'t get any clues what you have to do and/or how to defeat the new "enemies". While you understand what exactly you have to do, you\'ve lost some lives. But that\'s not so important.  I will strongly recommend this game just because of its graphics, entertainment and due the fact, that this game is not pay-to-win game.',
       'I really liked this game. The levels are very challenging and this game is addictive and fun. The only issue is that there are only 5 short lives  that when our lives ran out, we have to wait 18-19 minutes long to have 5 lives again. Of course, there are many hard levels in the game that keeps us dying and think a way to pass the level. So if possible, please shorten the time, like 5-7 minutes only and let us really enjoy the game. It\'s more even challenging and thrilling if there are many lives. And this game will be really perfect for us. Thank you.',
       'Completed all but just couldn\'t get enough of it. Everyone should play Redball 4. It is D best android games I\'ve ever played. Those who complained about the Game play and control has an abnormal thumb. Easy, Fun & Challenging but nothing impossible to get through. I just hope they make new levels.',
       'I love this game 😍😍 it is my favourite but.... I don\'t like The lives system . I have to wait for it . I know that there is a pro version but.. can you please give us one or 2 extra lives when we complete a level? I think it\'s a great idea😋😋 btw i loved it 😍😍😍 ill give it 5 stars then😊😊',
       'Amazing game reminds me of the old school games . But the only problem is the lives you give us to play. They are so few and they take a lot of time to refill. PLEASE remove the life or ball things from this game it will be the best if you do that cause I was playing and level by level I was getting exited and I wanted to rate this game 5 stars but suddenly this GAME OVER thing comes and I had to give you this ratings.please let us play without stopping and waiting for the life to come.' ,

       'Please fix the lag time while sending energy and tickets out..and opening envelope to send and receive..also while requesting tickets and,energy and collection items. Yes, my internet is fine. Yes, my android phone has the latest software. Yes, I have the latest update of the game. I do not have this problem while playing Crimal Case, Pacific Bay and Save the World. Thank you Andy and the team at Wooga for all their hard work to make this game enjoyable and addictive! I am on my third time through the game..Hoping there will be a fourth time!',
       'Love this game.  Haven\'t played alot of these types of games, but the few I have were either too graphic with murder scenes, or the charged you a huge amount of money. This game is great, you can win most of the things you need to play...it\'s fun, it\'s  methods are clear and attainable.  I also love landscaping my island...with no wars. Highly recommend it.  Soothing.',
       'Not just a hidden object game; a mystery, exploration, and gathering of artifacts and jewels. I  am thoroughly entertained.  Just wish energy lasted longer so could extend game play without purchasing more.  Renews fairly quickly though, so can return to play several times a day.',
       'The game is having trouble  downloading,  first it was freezing,  then it say no internet connection.  I\'ve  uninstalled and reinstalled it several times. This is the second time it\'s happened the first time you guys were able to fix it. Hope you\'re able to fix it on your end too. Thank you for your creativity I love your game, it\'s a whole lot of fun. Aloha',
       'I would give 5 stars across the board but it keeps shutting off on me, I have updated the game and it shuts off on me all the time. As soon as I start to play a scene and it takes an energy it shuts off. Please fix this problem' ,

      'Honestly I think it\'s amazing that they sell this game for free because it is one of the best games I\'ve ever played in my life. It doesn\'t take any internet and the animals in details so good and the graphics. If you\'re ever bored you should download this game and play it all the time.',
       'Highly addictive. I love this game but there is one fault that it doesn\'t allow your device to enter sleep mode. I have ruined 2 phone screens with burnt in images because of this. I would fall asleep playing the game and when I wake up it\'s still on the screen.  I also don\'t understand why the special games are not offered on the Facebook game.',
       'I adore this game. However, I have had 7 gold bars for over a year and every time I win a level that awards lots of gold bars the game tells me my bank is full... even though everything costs at least 9 gold bars. According to my math I should have over 100 bars. I would settle for two at this point.',
       'Love it love it love it....1/218..this is still one of 3 of my favorite games but... you have this golden piggy who collects gold bars.. i have filled it several times but then i find out you want me to pay for them after winning them... NOT HAPPY...',
       'Sometimes it feels like the difficulty of the levels is way off. Levels labeled "hard" or "super hard" are many times much easier than standard levels. I do enjoy the amount of unlimited lives given, and the speed at which lives are replenished, however. Overall, a good time-passer',
       'Previous prob:( Keeps on "Loading"). Also, it said 12 hours of unlimited play and I only got 3. 2/10/2018...updated review. This game is not good for seniors people.  I take care of seniors who have this game installed and they were unable to get past certain levels and ended up unistalling the game.  Too hard for seniors. Even though I passed certain levels, I m not getting an option to get help for 50 to 90 beans. I passed most of those levels with 3 stars, so why am I not getting any options for that? Its BS!' ,

Plus every time an add comes up it takes me straight to Google play with out me even tapping on it. It gets annoying. Another thing I don\'t like about this game is after a certain amount of levels you have to watch a video (add again) just to unlock more levels. And it does this more than once to. On the flip side it is a good game that gets the brain running and the levels do get more challenging throughout.',

      'I have to say I\'m disappointed that I can not collect when I\'m gone. And the fact that the damage is really strange. So my guy does only 10 damage then when I got the sheep he did 303 damage then the bat did 600 then it went up to 11k when I got the chicken. It is pointless to upgrade my guy if the chicken does 11k damage and the fact that I can\'t collect when I\'m inactive is a bit frustrating. It\'s called idle miner and yet you have to have the game active to get gold and resources if the chicken can do 11k and level 1 and I ONLY do 63 as a level 20',
       'Great game my only gripe is the cost versus value of iap after starter pack. Great deal for the 2.99 then next offer is 11.99 and only worth 3.99 at best. The items offered at the 11.99 pack are so not worth anywhere near that price.',
       'Worst idle game I\'ve played. Most idle games keeps on collecting recourses while your away, on this one you have to keep the game active.',
       'It\'s really fun it\'s just that sometimes it just takes so long to break the blocks. I like it how there is boosters and companions but I also like that they make good changes so I got to give this a four-star!',
       'Got to world 70, went back to Basecamp, started new adventure, I HAD TO START OVER?!? Fix the glitch, bug, whatever you want call it, and THEN I\'ll rate 5 stars! (P.S. I love Skippy The Goat)',

      'Cross platform across Apple and Android and PC makes this game a fluid joy to play, without the feeling of a toned down mobile port - due to its 1:1 experience from the PC. It\'s the only Blizzard game u can play on Mobile. I\'m a legend (highest skill tier) ranked and totally F2P so the people who say this game is pay to win or random luck do not understand the game. Paying for is meant for helping you finish your collection fast. Overall highly recommended.',
       'I used to play the old tcg and this not  close to be a good card game. All it is is monster with power, moslty no spell, no artifact, no nothing. This game is boring and is lagging so much on the cellphone. Shadowverse is ways better for a similar formula, has a really good storyline and a waaaaay more generous. When you buy card for HS you get mostly nothing. They had the chance to do something good, everyone love the lore of warcraft, but they BS it.',
       'Lots of fun over and over again. It doesn\'t get boring because of all the expansion updates that keep coming up. You need to readjust your decks to adapt with the new cards that get released. Didn\'t give it a full 5 because of the lag and graphic issues that keep coming up for me and others of the forums.               Playing on a Note 5',
       'No way to begin the game without being decimated by cards I never see available to a new player.  Just geared toward getting me to spend money to HOPE to be able to learn and entice me to spend some cash.  Captive audience I guess..seemed fun but without spending money there is no way to battle other players to progress.   Even the quests are too hard to gain enough.  Just like WoW, which I couldn\'t keep up with monetarily for computer upgrades, good idea but not for the masses, only for the people without bills and responsibility.',
       'There\'s apparently no coming back to this game. If you stop playing for a bit and come back you\'ll never be able to catch up. I\'ve tried building decks but everyone playing has the best cards already and unless I buy card packs I\'ll never catch up.',
       'I LOVE and am an avid player of HS on PC/Mac but this mobile app needs to update every few hours to everyday. It is absurd, annoying, and discouraging for mobile play.' ,

      'I\'ve made it heaps far in the game. The more you unlock the more you win in challenges. Nearly unlocked everything. When I do ill have to buy the remaining cars, only on small problem I\'m having is that I can\'t seem to score any more than 14000pts in a run I\'m lucky to get 11000pts a run. It would be alot better if the scores all round were larger (including opponents) to make you feel like you\'re doing better at the game by scoring more',
       'Best burnout game ever. I\'ve looked everywhere for a burnout game like this and I\'ve finally found it! Some things I suggest to put in could be a tow truck ( like Mater) and maybe a country farm burnout pit. Also if tire marks stayed on the track each time that would be heaps better. These things would make this game over the top amazing. GREAT GAME!!!',
       'FRICKIN AWESOME!!! This game is AWESOME! The controls are simple amd adaptable, and the graphics are amazing! It runs amazing for me, even on highest graphics.  Honestly theres not much for me to complain about, only that loading is a bit long. I like how if you spend just a bit more money you can skip wait times, and when you start it gives an actual tutorial. To me, if you have a problem with the game... You better hate the player, not the game.  Somethings I wish to see in the game is more customization, like body kits, hoods, spoilers, etc., more painting options, like custom colours w/ decals, and an option for how tires/tyres is spelled (tyres kinda bugs me). I would also LOVE to see a Hellcat Dodge Challenger in the game, its got plenty of power and even more weight! 😆 100/10 would blow tires again.',
       'It\'s a pretty good game but the only thing I don\'t like about it is that it\'s very big in memory and I have a lot of games on my phone over all I like the game at first my phone didn\'t let me download it I did not have any games on this phone I tried after a month and it worked do now that I have it I drove my first car and after they said its not ready when I tried to drive it I did a bug report on that and the cars are really expensive',
       'Experiencing problems again. Will lot load past the first loading screen. Just goes black. Have recently updated but still no different.  Have bought Agro Xa, Sicko, Lynchy and BlwnLux. Please resolve and fix this matter. Alex.',
       'This game is AWESOME love the realistic look of the cars controls are awesome only thing i suggest is maybe instead of helping the pro burnout cars by putting them in the game hows about finding some of the smaller up and comers and put them in and help get there name out there such as TYAFRYA from Madaz in Brisbane' ,

      'My only issue with this game is that u almost have to end up purchasing tix to continue to play. The further u move on in the game, the more tix each card costs & ur only given a certain amount thru a daily reward. App should provide ways to earn more tix, either thru a daily spin or higher rewards. *(since app developer replied to this review, I changed my review to 4 stars)',
       'Just played my first 4-5 rounds and this ROCKS! Not too fast. I love it! Fair Payouts but 1st, 2nd, etc same as others. Graphics work!  All Around impression... Awesome-ness. Update: I\'ve been here atleast  5mos... long enough to know this still ROCKS!',
       'I really like this Bingo  game.  A few upgrades and it will  be better than all the other Bingo games.  I love the amount of tickets it gives you to play.  I love the extra stuff you can earn and not have to pay for.  A couple of things that would  make this game better would be all 4 cards on one screen in tablet mode, the power ups being applied automatically  and being able to daub that last number that\'s  called cause usually that\'s the one needed for Bingo.  Otherwise its great.  I hope  you find this useful.  I understand  if you can\'t  fix all three of these but the first 2 are more important  than the last and i understand  there can only be a certain amount of bingos i guess.  Thank you.  Real close to being a 5 but those 3 issues really hold me back as I\'m  sure it does others as well.',
       'This used to be my favorite bingo game and then they updated it about a month ago (give or take a few days). Before the update, I was able to level up daily or every other but, now, it takes me a GOOD week or more to level up. That was my ONLY way to gain more tickets to continue playing without purchasing. I barely have enough to play 2 (4 cards each) rounds each day! REALLY stinks! Guess I will be uninstalling and going back to playing Bingo Blitz!',
       'I\'m happy to share: they heard us. We can earn power now, the games are fun, excellent pace. Thank you "Dataverse", I appreciate your changes 💯 ☠☠☠☠☠ UPDATE: n again 1/11. again: I ventured and came back. I can buy credit in January. Cuz we HAVE to have boosts to play long. Here I go !Update. I like a lot. Spent 20 but you simply can\'t spend enough.  must buy boosts too. Boosts get stuck',
       'I love this game. But i have a problem with this game. Sometimes i won 500 tickets and extra tru the tournament but my tickets went missing without i play the bingo. It getting reduced by itself. So pls you guys should take action on this maybe someone is spaming my game and stealed my ticket. This not fair to me. Please return back my tickets that have gone for nothing. Dont cheat me like this.' ,

      'Would be nice if there was a redo button for the last move. I\'m very quick when playing and I often misplace a block. Also, why does the Apple version have stars and the android version doesn\'t? I was trying so hard to earn enough stars to buy the colour packs on my iPod, and I got quite disappointed that I can\'t do that on android. I guess I\'ll just delete the game off android since there\'s really no goal to the game now.',
       'Kind of fun just trying to beat 1010. Played 5 times maybe and more than doubled the score that it says 1% get to..... not very fun after beating it. After the targets destroyed, what else do you aim for?',
       'Way too many ads. I just need something for my fingers to do while listening to podcasts but this constantly interrupts my listening pretty much after every round. I really liked the game but I have had it with thw ads and am uninstalling. It\'s just not worth it.',
       'I really like the game but as many others have said their are too many ads. Ads after every round and sometimes in the middle of the round which makes you start over and that gets annoying. Too many of thr same ads. I also agree their needs to be a redo button. It does get a bit pintle after you hit the goal but still fun.',
       'I\'m not quite sure what\'s happened to this game. It\'s very straightforward and strangely addictive. However, just today after Android\'s OS update, it performs much worse. Where before when you pick up a block, it is elevated slightly above your finger so you can see where it\'s going, now it\'s just under your finger, making this game frustratingly impossible. If this is due to an interaction with the OS update, then 1010 is due for it\'s own update.',
       'I still love this game but why did you change the colors!? It\'s so frustrating and confusing because the colors where just switched around. So I go to pit down a 4 block and realize too late it\'s a 5??' ,

      'Ever wanted to be Mayor? Ever wanted to run a town, develop the land, and see a metropolis grow? Well, look no further than Animal Crossing cuz this game does none of those things. You just merge buildings into better buildings. It is fun, if you spend money so that you\'re not bombarded with ads. But then you run the risk of being unable to watch ads when you want to to do things like double your earnings or unlock a better building from the mystery box.',
       'I like merging games, but this one has a huge ad issue that makes the game somewhat frustraiting to play. I\'ll click the store to buy a house and it will auto start an ad video. It\'s lacking a bit in the story line department too. For a base merging game it\'s simple and fun, but definitely needs some work.',
       'Such a terrible money grab. Ads cinsta tly pop up, making a consistent method for progressing impossible (which was most likely the goal). Didn\'t have patience to get very far, I feel like I\'ve wasted my time in the 5 minutes I played. Greedy devs forcing quality content behind a paywall making the game virtually unplayable for free. Terrible job.',
       'When opening the game it loads fine Nd does its idle thing, but I can\'t tap on anything. Completely 100%unrespomsive. After multiple attempts. Will change rating if game becomes playable before I forget about this review.',
       'The game just gets exponantially harder without any sense of progression and the worst prestige system ever. Didn\'t mind spending 2$ to remove overextensive AD use. They try to sell you lvl ups for base chest that are useless. You still need 256 boxes for the next building and 512 for the next evolution. Still grinding? To bad now its 1024 boxes',
       'Too many useless ads! I don\'t like being forced to watch ads. Especially when they take up more of your time than gameplay. The game forced me to watch a 15 second ad just to open the store. UNINSTALL!!!' ,

      'The game is ok at least when I get a chance to play it -there are way too many ads every time i click on a level to play an ad shows up even sometimes during when i play an ad shows up. I strongly recommend that you do not install this app',
       'Th is game sucks! It\'s a total waste of time and it is so boring. This is the worst game ever😡😤 Also there are so many stupid ads! The taxi is so slow and when other cars get in front of you it\'s even slower. I would not recommend this game to anyone!',
       'First if all... Its down right BORING! Also there is adds after every single level! Sometimes the adds are weird and innaproprete! I do NOT reccomend this game, download at your own risk😕',
       'I liked the game and all but there were way to many ads. Every level there was a thirty second video playing and some of them were extremely inappropriate. I got a bit impatient waiting for all the ads to end but I liked the game set-up. I think that was a neat idea. I just think it would be better without all the interruptions',
       'You see I\'m not the only person  who wouldn\'t recommend this game. Adds constantly and how could you play they game when it\'s so tricky to drive. I thought it was my bad driving but it seems I\'m not the only one who disliked this game.so  please make some improvements. I could drag you through all the bad things but I won\'t make you suffer. So I will give it sadly a 👎.',
       'I think it should be a bit more realistic and by that I mean more people on the streets; if you crash into someone, that person would come out of their car angry and cars get damaged when you crash into them. Maybe, to add a bit more reality to the game, you could add the money that they pay you to the levels. Apart from that it is an excellent game. However, some people, when they get in a taxi, chat away to the taxi driver.' ,

      'Honkai Impact 3 is one of the best  hack and slash action RPG in mobile games. Not only the gameplay is beautiful, but the controls are very tight. Love the graphics as they are very detailed and fluid in movement. I also appreciate how the game lets you adjust in-game\'s graphic so everyone can play according to their smartphone\'s specs. This game deserves more attention.  P.S : it would be wonderful if dev can make the game link to our gmail account instead, because it\'s not always safe using facebook. This will help many player feels safe about their investment.',
       'I love this game so much , especially on Yae sakura valkyrie♥. And very nice animation. If you can, pls reduces a price Diamond. is really expensive for me. Plus, can you make it some stage we can farm a Diamond in future?? is really hard to get some diamond more. and pls make a variety item shop for Gold instead using Diamond, i felt useless with many gold in this game.  I hope this game is more interesting and can buy more valkyrie\'s fragment by using gold in game in future. I know is Pay to win in this game, but please think for it for better in future because this game has potential to going up..   Good luck Devs Honkai Impact 3 I love this much game and thank you so much for Yae Sakura character ♥',
       'This game is amazing... The graphics are smooth, the gameplay is amazing, and for a mobile game my phone can handle 60 fps from it, you guys made something i never expected in mobile. A few minor things though, 1. The first thing is that this game is a bit grindy because of the level you need to unlock new levels, but that encourages doing hard/supreme mode so yeah, i love that you put dark souls and bloodborne references in the achievments, well the game is doing well so far so keep it that way, (also pls add offline mode, just a suggestion)',
       'Best mobile game I\'ve ever played. Story is good, awesome graphics, gameplay is not boring at all. Every character is unique, find your best waifu and team combination that suits your playstyle. U need more skill than money here. What needs to be improved are the translation and text layout (some of them can\'t be read coz it\'s trimmed). Also, please separate stigma and weapon gacha, I got too much stigma, when I need more weapon.',
       'It\'s great! But... could you please put a replace Facebook with Gmail instead? Facebook recently has been tight with their security and i can\'t be sure if my account would last long even though i invested too much in this game... so please, developers. Here me out on this. Not just me, but the whole community that supports your game. Make Honkai great again then ever before seen. Thank you.',
       'It\'s a great game. And gameplay is similar to ys game from Falcom. Cute girls. Decent rewards as a f2p player. However, other than your first login. Subsequent login has a bug which makes it stuck at the screen and only way to fix is to either on and off the wifi 20 to 30 times or switch between networks (mobile data and wifi) hope they fix it' ,

      'One of the best Sonic games with some cool new features added. It\'s even better then ever with the glitches fixed. (Thanks Sega/Whitehead!) It\'s very playable with a phone touchscreen, and plays like the original.  Could use the custom touchscreen control options that Sonic 1 & 2 had, but the controls work just as good as those regardless. Kinda wish it had Knuckles unlockable though. Still, great remake, time trial mode is great, and offers plenty of unlockables. It\'s especially worth buying "no ads" for offline play.',
       'Hey this game is good but what\'s up with the ring statics and the walk and tap down? Some times in a act I walk into a couple rings, only to hear this crazy static. And the spining. When I spin(walk and then tap down) I don\'t hear a thing. Normally doing that you should hear this sound like in other sonic games. Can you fix both of these glitches? Thanks so much.',
       'THANK YOU :) but the audio quality is bad. Keeps cracking. This wasn\'t a problem when this game was on the app store before :( and it kinda sucks that I can\'t play offline. I wouldn\'t mind paying if it means I can',
       'Well see its good game buuut there are waayy too many ads like heck if I pause it it will show an add and I don\'t see way you have to stay connected to the internet at all times',
       'Who is the clown behind this release of Sonic CD? No, really. Why would Sega allow a game as crucial to its history and as important to fans as Sonic CD to have such a mediocre release like this? The sound is broken, the adds aren\'t completely removed when you buy the game, and there are some glitches. Christian Whitehead sis an amazing job recreating this game in HD so that you can go and simply ruin his passionate, amazing work? This is disrespectful with everyone, including him. I\'m sure he gets pissed with this kind of thing. F*** you, Sega.',
       'PLEASE FIX THIS BUG!!!  Whenever I open the app, it goes to a black screen for 2 seconds, then force closes itself. Please fix this! I\'ve been hoping SEGA classic games would add this game to the app store for sooooo long!' ,

       'Can we adjust back end length and too tune length? Even just generic top tune sizes like 20.5, 20.75 and 21.00. And then back end length being able to he adjusted from 12.8-13.8. That\'d be great! Shorter back end allows spins to come around way faster. But be more unstable for grinds and manuals. Please add these features!!! Thanks for the great game!',
       'Awesome way better than the first one. When is the rest of the ones gonna come out? Like the scooter and stuff. P.s. if you could add a indoor skatepark like the one showed when you open the game would be awesome. Also if you could add the map warehouse from Tony hawk pro skater 1 would be awesome.',
       'Really love this game! But... is there really only 3 maps?? Ive been playing for awhile now and my skills are towards the top in each category. These 3 maps are no longer challenging... how or where can we get more maps?',
       'This game is really amazing but you should really get rid of top banner ad while your playing bc it covers whole top row so you cant really play s.k.a.t.e mode because your not able to see trick you need to do and also arcade is annoying when you dont see points or time you have left but otherwise game is amazing',
       'I think that this game is awesome but is it possible that you can make a scooter version of this as well and also add a first person feature, make it so we can do footjams and footjam tailwhips and more tricks. Great game though' ,

      'Great Game This game it truley fun to play! I don\'t understand why the rating is so low for it. The graphics are amazing and I like that you can connect with friends and play together. Honestly even though its a great game I wish we didn\'t have to wait to get more tokens to play. However if you really like the original game board Monopoly, than I suggest you get this app!! Don\'t judge a game by its rating!! ((;',
       'Computers players dice rolls feel manipulated. Also needs speed play to eliminate animations and skip to result of computers turn for faster rounds. Boring waiting for computer players to end their turns. Need more explanation of chance cards and swap options. Good concept and sound.. good graphics.. Stamps collected should literally be stamps in passport book.. not chips that doesn\'t make sense. Anyways I like it but the dice rolls feel pretty fishy.',
       'Good but what\'s the point? Good gameplay. Good graphics. Quicker than actual monopoly to play... However there is no incentive to win... No leader board, no win lose stats, no rewards, no unlockables... Nothing. So who cares if you come second third or fourth (that\'s just a loss) ... It should have win 25 games and unlock a different board or background or dice... The game would be worth 5 stars if it gave you reason to play.',
       'Format is good, ability to play the game fairly is poor. Several times I\'ve had a card played against me and did not know, so I couldn\'t use the \'just say no\' card I had. Other times I\'ve tried to use a card in the 3 seconds you get to react, but despite pushing the green tick to activate it - did not work. I lost the last game with 3 cards that I tried to use but couldn\'t...   Oh yeh, I bought 2 other versions of Monopoly on my galaxy 4 that I can\'t use on my galaxy 6, so I won\'t be buying this one..',
       'Could be better I like the concept... you have to wait entirely too long for your coins to regenerate.  Also why can\'t we play with random people online?  Good game over all but not worth 4 bucks for unlimited play with what is offered.  Basically you can play once per day smh... rethink this please then maybe I will rate it better or even buy it.  Why make it a free game and you really can\'t play',
       'Not really worth it It\'s nothing like monopoly one u get like 8-9 stamps it over no building no taking over I paid to have unlimited also now I see it\'s not worth it at all I also was believing u could just play with other plays by joining a game getting ready to start the 3.99 wasn\'t even worth it neither is this game unless they bring back the old way to win monopoly over all' ,

      'I like the game, but solitude is pretty much the same no matter where you get it. It\'s the little things that make it different. The card backs and faces are cool, I just wish that shuffling through the cards and reshuffling was a little faster. Overall, I love solitaire and play it A LOT, so this game is okay by me.',
       'By far the best solitaire app out of many I\'ve tried (and uninstalled). Responsive, fewer adds, clear, settings changes work, no glitches.  A simple and smooth experience.  The winning animations are a bit drawn out, and would be excellent if auto collect was much faster. Regardless it\'s still very good.',
       'This would be 5 stars except exiting doesn\'t exit. Using the "Back" button to leave and close down the game doesn\'t work. You\'re locked into the game end screen and are left to tap the recent apps button then kill the game using the "X" else tap the "Home" button, which leaves the game running in the background. Clearly the developers don\'t know Android as well as iOS, which doesn\'t give the option of exiting gracefully like Android...',
       'I\'ve played this game multiple times and have noticed a repeated pattern in the way the cards are dealt. No sure why the developer would do this. Maybe to keep the win rate at about 20%',
       'I\'ve played many solitaire games, but i love this one. Because I can play on my tablet horizonally. And the part on bottom  moves out of way..playing this way doesn\'t interfer with my charging cable. ty for great game',
       'The people that issued the game are just too greedy with the adverts. I can take some, but they came and came again. Thus, even with my mobile using \'do not disturb\' I had a lovely advert in the office when I should have been working.  Deleted' ,

Make a link at end to "rate the game," I wanted to, looked around, in end clicked link to play red then find yellow to do this rating... that\'s cuz I like yah... thanks for the smile!',
       'This is as simple as it can be, yet perfect in every way. Relaxing music that doesn\'t distract you from your game, smooth gameplay, easy controls. I liked the fact that you are tossed into the game without any tutorials, left on your own. I am not really into puzzle games but I completed this game in a single afternoon and it had me asking for more.',

I just have to edit this to add that I don\'t understand why people are complaining about ads. You only need to watch them for a hint, and only briefly. It\'s a free game, and the developer has to make a living. You can pay to get them removed, but they really aren\'t obtrusive at all.',
       'The color... Only yellow..its just yellow!! I\'ve played this game once amd its taken over my life. My bedroom walls were once blue..now all I see is yellow! My red hair is yellow, my brown cat is yellow.. Everything IS YELLOW. As I sink further into the eternal abyss of yellow, I can only scream. God has abandoned this app.. God save us all',
       'To be honest, I was like this is going to be boring 💤, but within minutes, I was totally hooked. Absolutely amazing, love it. If fact, I went straight back online and got red. I\'ve not heard of this Bart Bonte before, but he\'s a bit magic.',
       'It\'s so captivating I finished it in a single morning! I love how challenging the puzzles are at the same time they are fun.

      'I have only had this game for a few days, so I can\'t write a very comprehensive review just yet. But I have good feeling about this game. It is fun, challenging, with easy-to-learn controls. Less fast paced than Dragon SIM and less worlds and bosses. Customization is better though, and slower pacing may mean more long-term fun; not over so fast. Multiplayer is always a plus. Not pay-to-play, though paying gets you more benefits, it\'s up to you how you want to go about getting coins and acorns. Great game, few problems, would recommend.',
       'Hello, I absolutely love this game, it\'s very addictive. Recently though, it\'s stopped letting me go online. I have a strong internet and even tried using my mums but it has stopped working. I\'ve tried uninstalling the game and reinstalling it but it still won\'t work. I now can\'t play as my level 88 wolf because I am unable to connect to the server.',
       'On one of the quest, I think 11. There ia a syrange new animal and I went to the game menu for information and there wasn\'t any. It looks like a brown rabbit, I tried killing Rabbits squirrels and deer, but It wasn\'t the right animal! Is it in the snow biome?  Anyways hope you can help me and otger quest 11 users. It\'ll be great that when you get the same animal twice it counts as duplicate. For example "Wolf Common Duplicate +(however acorns). Thanks and the update is great!',
       'Thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you for making this!!! I already installed it and I can\'t wait to play it!! Thank you so much TRG! (Turbo Rocket Games) 😃😃😃😃😃😃😃 oh an one thing.. when your wolf is pregnant could everything be a lot slower & a lot weaker please? That\'d be great Thanks! 😃 Oh, yeah also for the new game seasons, I\'m thinking.. Autumn & Summer! And I like how you can randomize the name! And for dog sim, I\'m thinking.. maybe Samoyed Husky & maybe Chihuahua! 😀😀😀😀',
       'Man i love this game!!! So much better than wolfquest!!! I do hope tht this game soon be added new things like more animal to play as, better in performance. The ad free guys...keep it up!!! Just wondering if there\'s a add as mate system in multiplayer in the future? Anyways....this is the best wolf game tht i played!!! Do hope tht you guys one day add more animals to play as (like a snow leopard for example)',
       'The best app EVER! You start as a wolf and than get a fox, than lynx! You can play online and get stronger! No dirty language, they will stop that speech, if more rudeness ban speech for a while, nonstop, banned from all multi! It makes it a clean and fun game as you can also play as a baby animal, when it\'s ready to grow you don\'t have to grow it right away, you just press a button to grow!    I encourage you to play this game and rate it too!' ,

      'Fut can not be developed with this building team. Football is one of the most attractive games but how this fut goes? In Vs attack mode, what the hell meaning do chances have? Players must creat chances by themselves not the game. You must let them play whole game and create the chances by themselves. EA is a big builder in football games and develop a lot but have you ever thought how your fut only stands at this place?',
       'overall its an awesome game great experience. but Its hard for free to play players to complete and go through the events..... the icons are too difficult to get please make them a bit earlier to get, it will be awesome to have them in the team.... its difficult to get elite players in a pack of 500 fp totw pack n few others packs too... the vs attack mode is great.... EA please make sure that the free to play players to get a good experience of getting new and better players....',
       'Dear EA Sports: We really want to get the icon Ronaldinho but its changed and its very hard. Before we were required to have an 89 ovr+ team with atleast 5 Brazilian players but now it has completely changed. Now we are required to have a 98 ovr+ team with atleast 6 Brazilian players. I hope you make the icons a bit more easier. Thanks☺',
       'Pretty good game overall. The down side is that the matchups are truly awful.  90% of the time you go up against a team that\'s stronger than you & in this game that means a TON.  Better teams have better players of course, but it\'s not just that, the better teams get more chances and better chances making it extremely unfair.  If only they\'d fix that it would be close to a 5* game.',
       'Very fun game. I don\'t find it hard to get good players because the events are very good. Only changes I would recommend is to make the fans won/lost similar each time. It really sucks when I win a tense match and I only get around 5,000 fans. Oh, and don\'t get me started on the goalkeepers. They all definitely take steroids because they have inhuman abilities. And today, in a VS Match, I scored 3 goals but the results said I scored none! Nonetheless, very good game, enough to give 5 stars on. I have a 93 OVR team in Legendary III and I can\'t wait to improve and become a great player.',
       'FIFA Mobile is a awesome game and I have a good team after a few weeks with the events that they given it makes it easy to get coins.The only problem is I can\'t create a league.

      'This game could be really fun, i would have given 5 stars. I would be playing this all the time. BUT IT IS TOO HARD TO SEE EDGES!!!!! Or more accurately, the lack of edges. It is easy too difficult to distinguish when there is or is not a ledge to bounce off of. And it really kills the game when i expect a bounce, and get open cliff...',
       'It is truly an amazing application. When I first saw it I thought it was just a game like the others but then I realized that it has a level editor which has been my dream since I played for the first time mini golf. Without a second thought I bought the additional level objects and it was 100% worth it!',
       'Hurts when you are so close to a new record and you just can\'t sink it but this game is fun. I love the level editor and the user made levels couple of minor issues I have experienced but others have already voiced them and they aren\'t really that concerning. Good game and time-passer.',
       'Nice and simple game. Doesn\'t take much space and less battery usage. But, sometimes the ball will stuck at one point where it won\'t move anymore and you have to use a new ball. Hope you can fix this soon',
       'This game is perfect and so much fun. Managed to beat it after a couple of days playing it. The only issue I have with the game is the user made levels, hopefully they can filter some of the levels better.',

      'I enjoy 2048 alot. I play it alot and I would consider myself pretty good, my high score is 250,000. When i was building on that high score, the screen glitched and swiped a number of times, ruining the order of the numbers. This has happened on multiple occasions only in this app. It\'s not such a big problem for people that are newer, but when you\'ve got big numbers, such as 8192, it makes the game unplayable.',
       'Awesome game I have basically mastered this game. Got a high score of 2,892,204. I made the highest tile which is 131,072. This game is amazing and requires intense focus. I lost focus for a second and a 4 appeared and I didn\'t notice. Messed me up when I was about to make the 65k tile',
       'best beain adict game. but 9 grid stage doesnt fulfill. not enough grid box. the Creator cheated. i m going to lodge a complaint against you. you ve to answer my brain😀 anyway superr game excellent',
       'When the game ends it\'s very abrupt - the board disappears to be covered by an ad and load music blares - very unpleasant. I hate the color scheme - this would be much funner if could choose - Caribbean blues, shades of green, Valentine reds and pinks...',
       'The game is great, but the leaderboards are seriously messed up.  The top high scores are literally orders of magnitude higher than it is physically possible to get.  I would assume that they have been "hacked" somehow to display these fake scores.  The developer should cap the high score at the number that is literally the highest possible score (based on the size of the board)',

      'Great and fun game, I unlocked everything and I know this probably won\'t help but you should make it to where there is an online 4 player battle where on the left or right you can fly around with a joystick and also shoot around with a joystick and you could pick up guns and fight to the death',
       'I like this game  it is fun but like one other guy said there should be a way to throw your  weapon  after ammo is out or when you want and should break a limb instantly but only one all in all great game and love the deflection physics',

       'This is the worst game there ever was just like the creator and don\'t get mad at me just because it\'s bad now let me tell you why it\'s bad the controls are bad and the gems that you get get restarted every 5 minuets and it\'s just and over all bad game',
       'You should make a button to drop and throw your weapon',
       'I think this game has got a potential buuuuuut this game needs easier controls.KEEP UP DA GOOD WORK!!!!!!😗' ,

      'This game is kind of creepy... I was talking to a boy named Lucas and he asked "What is your last name?" Then I asked a girl named Jessica a question and she said "When is your birthday?" This game says it isn\'t looking for personal data but it is. It\'s not safe and it wants to learn more about people. I don\'t trust this game! Also if someone mentions \'Dr.Wallace" ask them who it is and then you will see what I mean.',
       'I think that this game is trash DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME!!first they won\'t even let me in the game but when I finally got in I couldn\'t even ride anything I built.snd I wanted to talk to but the people there are just robots!I know it sounds dum to say that but I am at my limit with this game.',
       'Best game ever you actually ride the slides and go in the pool and do more it does not tell you what you HAVE to do it tells you what things you CAN do and I love this game I never get bored. 5 star for me. I rec commend this game for you.💙',
       'DON\'T YOU DARE TO DANLOAD THIS GAME IT SUCH A BAD GAME IT KICK ME OUT OF THE GAME EVERY TIME HOUR DAYS WEEK MONTH AND YAER SO ANNOYING',
       'When i wanna have a map it keeps kick me out of the game and its working when i wanna go in the water slide its horrible because i canot slide when i wanna talk to fake people jessica said "hi how old are you?" So creepy This game really creepy. DO NOT INSTALL!!!!',

      'Began playing a year ago and still hooked on the  challenges and variety which continues to make this my favorite slot! Keep up the great work people 😁. UPDATE: Still hooked! The variety&amount of special bonus games they throw is unlike any game I know. Wicked cool you guys... thanks for the great entertainment for FREE.... I\'m a lifer.',
       'Been playing this game for over a year and for the past 2 months it hasn\'t paid out a thing. The game is updated. Can you guys at murka help me out because it\'s becoming very boring. Thanks',
       'Yeah. Not into slots really. Actually It\'s a waste of time. Then I downloaded this app.   Pretty darn good! Keeps one busy for a good while. I don\'t like slots, but I love this slot game!',
       'Probably one of the best slot\'s games. Compared to most other\'s I\'ve played I don\'t feel the pressure to buy currency to keep playing. That and the daily and hourly bonuses do indeed help to further pad this. Overall, it\'s a very good game.',
       'The loading screens get stuck. There is a delay on wins sometimes. Overall it\'s a poor execution of a game development. Other than that it looks great and there are tons of different slots to play.',
       'Would give a better rating if the last update didn\'t take 3000 gems and open a new slot on my behalf. Quite disappointing. I payed as well as earned those gems over time and now this happens. How and why has this update decide how to spend my gems while playing various slot tournament opportunities that are promoted In the Game? I feel as if I\'d have better luck at a casino then to spend money on this game, at least I\'d either break even or make money. Again, feeling ripped off here.' ,

      'I personally didnt enjoy the game. But I have to give a good review. Programming a game like this requires bravery since the lack of similar games are non existant this could fail big time. While hard to control it is interesting to see a MTB game.  So I give 3 stars. This requires more improvements, but it is on a good path. Keep up the good work',
       'Really a worst game I have played up to now. They just cheating us by showing purchased rating. When ever I am playing the game my phone stars vibrating. And it\'s a use less game. If you don\'t know how to create a game and how to design it, just simply sit or sell cloths. Don\'t play cheap tricks. You are completely stupids.',
       'Graphics: good, very good. Control: tilt/buttons/joystick work fine. But the camera is so low that it looks like you are in a cart or just body-sliding, and the controls become uncomfortable to use.. Therefore, gameplay sucks, if you play with data/wifi, ads spam every time you start a game, the shop gives you just a set of clothes or plain colors for the bike.. Uninstalled after 5 mins of gameplay.',
       'It\'s cool. I hope u add the chat column. And also we can get out of bike and then we could go hiking. I would have rated 10 stars if these things in NBA could be added',
       'Relatively fun game. So many bugs but what can you do. This game has so many ads though, you cannot play with wifi or data on. Also, they like to use subliminal messaging. When you crash sometimes, for part of a second, the whole screen is full of slow motion powerups. A little sneaky don\'t you think?',
       'Please do not download it. It will drain your battery fast.Worst game ever...wondering how it got 10 million downloads. After installation realizing that battery is getting hot and quickly discharge. Controls are very worst. Hated it.' ,

I love the theme of killing slugs! So cute! There are in app purchases but they are totaly worth it! If you get the game now you can get 5 dollars worth gold and diamonds! Ans the themes are lit! I can say that i am very hooked to this game! Me and my friend are battling to see who get get farther! We are at 12 and up! See if you can beat us! Download now!',
       'As of today I can no longer finish any levels. It gets to the give up or get 5 moves screen, I click give up and it freezes. I have too close and reopen the app. The worst part is it takes my lives, but doesn\'t give me credit for the Rose challenge. I updated and tried uninstalling and reinstalling. Please fix this.',

      'The game was great until they put the ads on there, there are too many and 90% of the time I try to "x" out of one, it takes me to the play store anyway, and the game freezes a lot more now. It\'s also frustrating you can\'t alter the decorations. Game needs some improvements, and I hope they address them because it\'s quite fun to play.',
       'I am so disappointed in this game due to the fact my 3 year old somehow bypassed my password and spent 79.99 on coins!!! I sent a message immediately to Google play and the developer and I was told it doesn\'t meet the refund requirements. WTH?!! So frustrating! 😡',
       'This game would be a whole lot of fun IF there weren\'t so many ads! My niece is not patient enough to wait for stupid ads to finish, and u can\'t play the game until the ad is finished! Very disappointed!',
       'Love this game. Super fun but how do you get rid of ads? I paid for coins yet i still have ads. This is highly annoying especially if i can\'t skip them. Still love the game just not the ads :(',
       'Hate this game... been stuck on this one level...there is no way to win it... I had 12 free lives...used them all and still didn\'t pass the level...stressing me out..time to delete game...NOT PLAYING ANYMORE 😠',
       'Ahh I think it\'s a pretty good game. This is the 1 st time I\'m giving my review. I loved the game.I\'m.now in lvl 179 this game is fantastic but the lvl r so hard as we increase our lvl. This game have a good graphics, game, control n plz make more this kind of games' ,

      'One way to check how much products I have left is by touching the machine and thr corresponding product but sometimes the game will assume  that you are putting the product into production hence it will put the product into production whether you want it or not so it will waste production time. Sometimes the touch is too sensitive. Sometimes the touch is not sensitive enough which forces me to drag the product into the production slot up to 10 ten times just to start production. I know this feedback is not much but maybe an undo button will help. It makes the gameplay million times difference if you  put your players comfort a priority.',
       'înstaII " UNOPAY " App Enterr (GEMSO) to Start Earmings So far so good.Fun way to get money. Won\'t make you rich but the extra cash is helpful. It\'s also the best exchange rate on points. Uno points equals uc instead of like some of the others where it takes Uno points to reach uc etc....Also, înstaII " SUZICASH " App Enterr (SUHA) very reliable in paying you when you redeem to waIet/GEMs. You can choose assorted giftcards as payment or transfer to waIet for cash. Your choice. I love these guys thanks for addingsome fun to my day.',
       'I buy an axe it will last forever same thing with other tools but here I have to keep buying tools to do the job. An if I need more crop I get the land ready for more seeding get the water. This you have to bring in more people that never show up to do the work. That\'s why if I\'m going to farm I count on one person me. Here you need others. It not for me.',
       'Long time player returning to the game after taking a break. I leveled up to level 41 today. Before leveling up it showed I should get 1 white and 1 black rabbit with the new level but I didn\'t get either of them. I would also like to see it a bit easier to get wildlife refuge animals. 36 puzzle pieces seems a bit much.',
       'I love the game but going to give 4 stars because the newspaper should be in color! Please change this. And please give it a tan for mining tools and maps act so it don\'t take up storage space IJS my opinion!',
       'The game is addictive and nice to play. Please consider my suggestions and fix in the next or upcoming releases,  1. Reduce the time in the preparation of the jam machine as it consumes very long time. Else provide another machine  2. When we add something on the queue in the machine, there should be an option to remove the added item on the queue if the particular preparation not started. For example.  Am preparing product 1 in a machine and added 2 more products in the queue, later found that we have incorrect added the 2 more products, an option to delete that.   3. Why the puzzle moves to animal randomly, it\'s taking very long time to unlock an animal on the sanctuary. Hence request you to unlock one animal and then the puzzle goes to another animal.    Thanks.' ,

The first one was such a great game and some of these are enjoyable,  if you have the patience to wait for them.',

      'This game would have been awesome if you didnt ruin, see, this just shows the world that companies dont give a rats....  About what we say and that, question, how the hell am i suppose to play with my friends instead of randoms, there is no friend system, this basically a pokemon set up with different graphics. Oh, and how many of these ratings is real, i know mine is.',
       'I would have rated all 5 stars before the update. Now I just want to delete it completely. You absolutely ruined it with this massive locking mechanism on items and with items being used in turn. I can have everything i need to revive or cure or this and that but can\'t use them because I\'m getting one hit by the sane morty on every character and can\'t even revive. This bs. No longer fun at all.',
       'I love this game, it\'s super fun. The only problem is, I wish it was possible to regain access to previous accounts if you return after re-installing the game. On multiplayer I tried to use my previous ID name and it was already in use... by ME. Now I know that my game account hasn\'t been deactivated, I just can\'t access it and I would love to keep all my progress',
       'This game is freaking awesome in every way!! Absolutely great old-school game play just like you\'re playing Pokemon! Which is awesome!!...... However I have a big question... My game got accidentally uninstalled...... So then I reinstalled it, and I was wondering if there was a way to reload my game profile since I read downloaded the game?',
       'Its stupid. If ur doing good in a in a battle all of a sudden your mortys will start missing I\'ve had mortys that have missed three or four times in a row after the first hit drains more than three-quarters of their power but I have never seen the computer Miss more than one time',
       'Absolutely love this game and was instantly hooked. My friends kept talking about it and so I downloaded it and have been playing it non stop for the last 2 days. Absolutely suggest people download it. I only have one slight inconvenience. I really wish there was a friend system that allowed players to play together specifically with each other' ,

      'Does not hardly ever match with the amount you are betting so if you are betting 500,000 you will hardly ever match it or win over the amount so the small bets suck and do not equil to the amount you are winning. Sure you will hit some big wins but watch your winning amounts and see it dwindle slowly.   Winnings are fast at first but slows way down. I use max bet when testing slot games and this one takes your winnings just as fast as you get them.  Also u have to follow there story line and you start off with just one game that you have to play for 10 levels and a new game opens and that is every 10 levels.  So at level 100 you only have 10 games to choose.',
       'This game is at most decent. The biggest issue I face in the game are the symbols. The power up stars to help you level up, the scatter symbols and the bonus symbols only get in the way making it very difficult to get good line hits. Not to mention most of the slots pay very poorly. The bonus games are unique but very difficult to get and pay poorly. The free games are very boring with no real motives to get excited to get them, also poor payouts. You can\'t make an account and not save progress. The Artemis slot and Hestia slot NEED AN UPGRADE, two very promising slots are ruined do to the fact that the scatter and star symbols all get in the way. PLEASE get rid of the damn stars And make free games obtainable in a different way. I can not tell you enough how many times Iv almost had a good 5 of a kind when all of a sudden the star or scatter symbols get in the way. The hourly free coins are decent and the daily free spin for coins is ok. There are also it\'s good side to this game. Like I mentioned before the bonus games are unique and fun and the graphics are great. The slots offer a few ways helping you to gain a good win and achieveable quests to help you gain more coins and level up faster. This games has much promise to it and because it is sill an early game I think I will continue to play it in hopes that the creators can update this to be a fantastic game',
       'Tick tock tick tock I\'ll tell ya I\'m close to uninstalling just sitting waiting for your team to get it together and finishing level 70 and up',
       'In one night I completed all stages with no losing at all this games is worth downloading',
       'Can\'t stay off this game. I\'m so addicted, lol',
       'Its amazing game to start off playing then it gets difficult, but still love the outcomes. 💞👍👌✌' ,

      'Pro: Its a pretty challenging game but not to put your out. There is also some daily chanllenges, new revamped arena to do with also some clan battle. The new room system that brings makes some level design unique. Some variety in levels and pigs. A new bird introduced: Silver The fortune tower   Cons: The lives system. Doesn\'t have that much of a story. Silvers ability is kinda disapointing.',
       'The game is very nice.Pls do some minor bug fixes . When will the NFL hat sets will be for sale by using black pearls. Please fix the tower of fortune as the pig never allows to go above 2nd floor and it appears on any card I pick after that. Fix these issues. A very nice game.',
       'Great game, but honestly they need to tweak the chests for in app purchases. Why are the things not all even? I should be able to get the same level of item. If I spend 80 jewels, all the items should be equivalent. There should 3,500 feathers on the same page as 7,500 feathers. If I\'m level 300, even the common chests could reflect that. People will spend the money. Why not offer all the daily specials all the time? It\'s fun, but I spend cash money on this game, let\'s make it worthwhile...',
       'Game is fun. I\'m giving it 1star because I can\'t turn off the notifications. Just turns back on and bothers me at all hours. Oh, and the stupid debris flying through stupid tunnels over and over and you can\'t progress until the debris breaks and it never will and wastes your gems.

       'It dosentt work at all since last update 2 weeks ago,   I\'ve tried re-installing it on my Samsung galaxy s3 and my tablet..    It is still completely useless on both devices.    rovio needs to be better than this to its paying customers...  It is ignorant as a company to not even try to fix this problem.

       'Game is great for the first several days, then gets so ridiculous that it no longer is fun. I\'m assuming that\'s when they want you to start dropping your hard earned money to keep up... My problem with that is: either you have ads that provide your revenue, or you have a pay-to-play game. In the end, it\'s just every other angry birds game.' ,

       'I like playing this game although i find that male characters do not have many long hair/ girl hair options available to buy unless you are vip or have diamonds. I think i speak for many people when i say that boys and girls should have more hair options from the opposite sex, for starcoins, as some people may take offense if they are strictly only allowed "boys hair"/ "girls hair" unlsss they are paying for it. I think you could inmprove further by making it easier to earn starcoins and another way to earn diamonds because many people do not want to/ cannot afford to BUY items in a fictional world.. Overall, i think this is a well rounded game, with a few improvement points, however i enjoy being able to have my own unique style in a virtual world :)',
       'Its a fun game however there are hackers,scammers ,glitches and its really annoying when the game freezes. Also when people post art books they can be really inappropriate. I think you should be at least  13 to play this game because of the inappropriate art books. I think the new update is great but I would like it if we would make n buy wish list on tablet and  on phone. Its a fun game but you reply need to think about who you can trust because many people just ply with your feelings.',
       'Can I request you have a different way of changing your password? My reason is because I got hacked and my email address is not working on it! Overall a great game but please change how you change password to make it easier! For the people who don\'t know their email I am there for you!',

      'Whenever you die in the game you start completely over again. And after each game an advertisement plays. Wish there could a 5 second skip button like YouTube does, especially you guys advertise every time after you die/end a game.  The graphics are cool, love the neon colors. It\'s a game for all ages!!! My kids and my husband and I all play this game. It\'s very competitive!!! I swear my husband can\'t beat my score no one has lol',
       'It is soooooo addictive and also VERY awesome. The only problem is that because people go on the game on their phone\'s or tablets I find it hard to control I don\'t know if anyone else thinks so but that\'s my opinion. Pls no hate anyway, Peace out and the reason it is like slither.io is bc it is by the same company',
       'It\'s good but not what I would play on daily basis..... it\'s my opinion so don\'t get mad. The controls are OKAY and I think they add more stuff to the game, I don\'t have any ideas for it though. This game is great and in the people like it but for me I wouldn\'t play it all the time on a road trip. Keep up the good work though! 😀😀😀',
       'Great game can be addictive with no real goal but to eat others poop as me and my daughter call it and other worms to grow bigger. Top notch comical game EVER that you wont be able to stop. Only set back is that the game gets extremely extremelylaggy on addroid tablets and on the online game interface',
       'start to crash often when playing online. i think it need some sounds or music. playing silent for long time feels like going stupid after long time played. since it so addictive . keep repeating boring play but keeps ppl playing. is fun though, but I think everyone need to keep control how much time played. can\'t believe I can play for like hours haha. don\'t know why my Nick name don\'t show anymore. usually is \'eat uuu\'. but shows as nothing ____ now.',
       'Worst game played ever . Too irritating , so many adds . Very disappointed . I was just seeing the ratings and I thought it will be good but after that I got very much angry. PLEASE NEVER DOWNLOAD THIS GAME. Slither.io is much better game than this one. Worst game controls' ,

      'This is AWESOME!!!!!! You will love this game. Download it now and you will not be sorry!!! Lots of wins and free spins and bonus wins. I am now at over 8 billion and that was done in alot less time then you think.  Lots of fun here. I do have one issue with this game. After level 25 it takes a long time to get past another level and it will take 5 levels from that to open another game and games can get boring to play but you will win alot and it\'s still very fun to play. Still worth the down load.',
       'It\'s a great game if you like consistency. The level are set up the same way, with different icons. The down fall is that there is a limit on how much you can bet, you wouldn\'t be able to bet 3/4 of your pot or even 1/2 your pot. This game is still by far a really good game.',
       'Thank you for creating a game that is actually fun!!  The payouts are excellent!  This is the best slot game that I have played and I have been through quite a few!  The only thing that could make this game even better is to make clubs so we can talk to team mates!  Please do not change the win/loose ratio like all other slots have done.  I have recommended your game to everyone I know with positive comments from all!',
       'Played a lot of these games and this is the best by far. Love it Don\'t waste your time with any other game. The pay outs are frequent and sizeable. I\'ve been playing max bets for ever and I\'m sitting with 6.5 trillion in credits. That\'s right ......thats trillions. Best slots',
       'This is a very entertaining game. Great graphics,great returns. No complaints, plenty of plaudits. This is the second time I\'ve written a comment. Do you feel insecure? Do you need me to write a second review? I stand by my original comment. Please don\'t ask me to write a third review, it takes me away from the game!',
       'Awesome payouts! Frequent wins. Great graphics only down fall is it takes awhile to level up which gets boring also would rather be able to bet higher make it more risk taking cheers' ,

      'Freezes usually when watching ads. Or you can\'t exit ads there is no X. Like everyone else is saying it actually cost alot of real money if you want to really play. I miss the days when you can pay for a game and then pay for expansion packs. But no.... Games now days are money pits and I\'m not falling in. But it\'s a pretty fun game, just takes forever to do anything. They should also always give you a option to use in game money instead of in game coins.',
       'The game was very fun. I even spent quite a bit of money to get told bars so I could progress but now I\'ve got to the point where there\'s nothing to do except repeatedly go to auctions without any objective. Please update soon so I can feel my money isn\'t wasted',
       'The game moves too slow. The rewards are not big enough for the real money and getting one gold per ad is not enough. From the moment you begin the game until day forever it\'s just too slow to have fun. Double the speed and charge a dollar or 2 and you\'ll make the millions you want. Just make it fun instead of sludge. I\'ll pay you ten bucks to open it all up with no ads if you\'d just make it fun',
       'I only downloaded this game yesterday but I\'m addicted to it already. As with all games there are a few little things that annoy me but overall it\'s definitely worth playing. Would recommend to anyone who just looking to pass some time',
       'The game keeps shutting down in the middle of an auction and I lose money and my energy 😡 I would actually spend a few real dollars on this game but not if I\'m gonna be losing energy like that. Also I think there should be a way to earn more energy...it\'s not enough free and takes too long to replenish. I love the game tho.',

      'I really love this game but ever since the most recent update , everytime I try to open the standard hunt screen it starts merging with the dog hunt screen and doesn\'t let me do anything. Also it\'s really a huge Hassel to get silver eagles and that makes the game play significantly worse then it should be. Again I really enjoyed this game but I\'d really appreciate it if all the above was fixed. I can\'t be the only person complaining about this.',
       'Too many ads in the game now the ads play without bonuses like free gold.  They want $99.99 for 5,000 gold and they charge 8,300 gold for one hunters permit in region 51.  The price is ridicous for that.  I would pay a couple of dollars to eliminate ads.  I would pay a dollar or two to for a one time hunt in region 51.  Deer hunter makes a damn good game but is run by people that dont give you good value.  The ads are annoying.',
       'Okay so at first this was a great game. But in the 4th region having to use bows was cool to but here\'s the catch, your first bow costs 6000 platinum eagles and only earning 2-5 eagles a hunt is down right bs. This doesn\'t include all the up grading to the bow. Please fix this , either give better rewards or lower the costs. I know there is one OK way to earn eagles but it only works with win streaks with I don\'t like I like the hunting aspect not the competition. Makes it hard to just sit back and relax. Oh and it\'s bs during these leagues that you send out more animals marked for the opponent than for yourself ensuring an absolute loss. Fix it or all together drop the league BS.',
       'Love this game but having problems now that I have reached region seven. It won\'t let me access  but once and then it locks me out. That\'s from the entire game. Freezing and problems with it loading. This bug needs to be addressed asap.',
       'Excellent game to pass time, only down side are the ads. You want to talk about ads. I\'ve never seen so many ads in a game. Literally every single hunt , which lasts maybe 30 seconds. You have an ad that is 6-30 seconds long. That is highly annoying.',
       'Its a good game but the ads let it down there is literally a ad Evey 2mins after Evey shoot and just about everything you click. Gameplay is good and addictive. Grafix are good. Controls could be better but its not really a problem. No real need to spend real cash although if you do you will get better items and better challenges and progress through game a lot quicker.. If there was a ad free version I would happy pay £5 for that maybe more' ,

      'Winning a bingo is impossible without using rare power ups. You go through them quickly and only earn a couple if any after each game.  If you don\'t want to spend real money I wouldn\'t bother.  It\'s very entertaining if u don\'t mind spending cash.',
       'At first I was iffy about downloading the game. I remember playing back in the day. But, this is AWESOME to play. I am truly hooked to this game. You guys did such a great job at making this game fun, entertaining and just straight GREAT! My friends now play it as well. 😀💜💜',
       'It would be great but when the last number is called it doesn\'t even give you time to hit the number. And that\'s really aggravating when it\'s a bingo. Because you get screwed out of it',
       '11-2-17 Every time there\'s an update, the game is unable to play or load.  The app is a hit or miss. Sometimes it loads up, but mostly lags or gets stuck. I have to force it to stop running, then go back in. As I\'m typing this, my free spin is still spinning.... Going on two minutes.  2/10/18  "Server not recognized" keeps popping up.',
       'What\'s up with the message re untrusted server  twice I\'ve logged in and have list 32 credits, game kicks me out.',
       'I give this a 1 star because everytime daub on every other number it doesn\'t daub and i end up hitting bingo by accident because i am constantly pushing the number and causing me to hit bingo so i just end up wasting  my Bingo chips to even play. Please fix this issue' ,

      'Downloaded this through another app (free golden eagles) where if you downloaded and played this game, and got castle to level 10 would be rewarded. Sent off request to support a number of times with proof and no reply, and after a week still no reward.   So if you are downloading this to get reward from another app don\'t bother as you won\'t get it',
       'Pure pay tto win. You will either pay or quit out of frustration. Build times are hilarious. Seriously, our Earth\'s sun will die before you max out your hero\'s knowledge or most any other knowledge.  The Stronghold is worthless and a huge waste of resources. It\'s more of a trophy.  Sure you can join a clan, get some bonuses and buy some shields with points, but you will be destroyed by the winners. Me, I had a gift card and blew on this game, now I just start fights and make people quit.',
       'The game itself is great. Zero complaints there. But the fact that it I am unable to ever log in is infuriating. I\'ve literally been zeroed out because the app won\'t let me log in... multiple times. It\'s absolutely ridiculous. Needs to be fixed.',
       'you guys give an update for us to move kingdoms. but it make so expensive that\'s it\'s unaffordable. like really 2 dakars  on a 12.99 pack. So you expect us to spend over 100 dollars just to move a kingdom. I don\'t know if your team there at plarium realizes that there is not 1 ps4 game that costs this much. seriously don\'t release an update that\'s not affordable don\'t make any sense.',
       'Great time killer, I love the interaction and concept of the game. It can get a bit laggy at times and at it\'s worst, it will crash on you. The wait times are unbearable though. No ads at all since the first time I played too!',
       'Having trouble still with scrolling through the Kingdom map. Also got a issue with someone \'s shield not coming down when he attacked me. People cannot attack while there shield is up, or do they attack that fast they put a shield up after the attack. less than 1 minute .Anyway the game is very slow and glitchy, was better when first installed it. I cannot do battles like this the game sometimes crashes or I have connection problems.' ,

      'Love this little game! I wish we had five life\'s, Three just gets me started. But overall, it\'s a great game. Getting like Candy Crush the higher the level the more impossible it gets to finish. Please don\'t make it so hard to win. I keep having to use coins to buy lives. Can never build up enough to amount to anything. Also you can give cash on the scratch off card. PLEASE !!!',
       'Yesterday I would have given 5 stars, today I would give minus stars if I could. After update, game will not start. Tried reinstalling a couple of times and still nothing. Been playing well over a year but today I have lost everything. Very sad. 😣😥😢😤😭😬😟 Please fix it.',
       'Could you please tell me why every city is closed after every update ? This coming from a guy in South Africa which has the most expensive networks in the world. It costs more than $ 20 every time I update the game to open the cities I\'ve finished already. I need these cities open to ship resources. So could you please explain why these cities are closed after every update?',
       'My friend was able to get 2 extra lives without paying anything!  She started after I did but it was never offered to me.  So I stumble along with 3 lives while she has 5.  No wonder she is catching up with me.  Some levels are quite difficult but I keep trying.  Would like to be able to choose the cities I travel to.  Building up my airplane points so I can but that is slow to grow.  I refuse to purchase items.  May never complete the game as they keep adding cities.   Would like another Canadian city though.  Maybe Vancouver?',
       'Been playing this game since Dec 2016. Quite interesting so far. But since the last update I have lost all my fb friends and thus not receiving any lives and gifts. It\'s getting awful.',
       'Build the iconic Sites of the World. You START in Sidney, Australia!  Come on,  Join the traveling FUN! Playing with friends; especially when your in the same country,  it\'s a traveling, building race to the next country. Additive!

      'This is a great game with good ideas. Don\'t listen to those people who say it\'s bad as its not. There are some flaws, mainly in the fact that there are only a few maps so more maps would be nice. Also, it would be nice if you could change the name or if there is a way, tell me. There are other slightly bad things but overall a great game.',
       'Great concept the only thing wrong with it is the slow movement\'s that happens some Times during the game hope  that you all fix it. Another thing is the lack of stages there are only four to three stages and all of them are with ice add more and I guarantee your that your ratings is going to rise. Finally the option to change your name at the main screen and better control\'s than just jumping. Would love to play it once these issues are fixed and I don\'t mean to be harsh hope you all got my opinions',
       'This game is good awful DO NOT INSTALL. The graphics are the only decent thing in this game and they are ripped off of the real game. The controls rarely work. The ads are always in the way. The AI\'s are OP and there is no point in playing the game. Its a much better idea to just buy the real game on steam instead. 100x better',
       'The graphics are perfect for the style, but attacks should be more under your contract with weapons, and variation without. I also can\'t find the Bluetooth multiplayer hinted by the Bluetooth connection permissions. Is that a later feature? If so please add soon!',
       'I like this game but please the attack please make it more sence attacking only jumping why dont u make like in pc moves',
       'The name is player I can not play without the name on it I want my name to be iamaStac8 and I want my skin to be color I don\'t want to be my skin yellow oh my gosh I don\'t want Mess up games I want good games' ,

      'Cards are clearly rigged and it is so obvious.  The developers are nothing but low lying cheaters probably still living in mom\'s basement. Case in point: My opponent takes the discard, the 2 of spades, gets gin immediately, but doesn\'t use the 2 of spades. The cheating developers should be humiliated by this garbage.',
       'Like this game but it is rigged for you to lose and have to buy more credit. You should be able to win on your own merit not when the computer decides. Just played a game that went for an hour. Opponent  (a bot) played every card after time ran out and never got booted. Knocked every time for less than 5 points. Deleting game,.',

       'Absolute rubbish DO NOT BOTHER WITH IT. AND DON\'T PLAY THE FRUIT SHOWN AS GUESTS BECAUSE THEY JUST TAKE YOUR COINS, THEY ARE PART OF THE GAME. And when you start winning it loses connection when none of my other games do, i play on my other laptop to test ut and that worked fine playing other games so how come gin rummy always cut off. Then you get some that play 1 game then shove off. And when you start having a winning run it decides to cut you off by making out connection is lost, WHEN I HAVE PERFECT WIFI CONNECTION,  dont like you winning too often.   Verse 2: When you keep winning you get disconnected, strange when nothing else doesnt disconnect at home, THEY DONT LIKE YOU WINNING TOO OFTEN. Also dont play players with no picture as you wont win, they always get straight fixed hands to beat you. Its strange how some players keep getting strajght hands time after time after time, it does all it can to stop you winning, DONT PAY ANYTHING INTO THIS GAME. Then you get the idiots who play 1 game then shoot off soon as they lose, LOSERS. Just won a straight hand and didn\'t pay out the jackpot saying there was nk winner, another fricking catch to stop you getting the jackpot. And it must be a fix how come some players keep getting straight hands time and time straight after each other. And some players just grab and run.',
       'What a rigged game. I have played 100\'s of hands , but never got gin after drawing the first card, but other people are.

When i do so it shows the doubled value with the option to double again, and again the process can be repeated. This has amazing potential, But im really curious about how much Wiz is involved with this project, hmu i have plenty of ideas to make this game amazing--- love the new strains and goals btw! Keep up the amazing progress',

I don\'t get why game developers can\'t just make a great game you want to make purchases in. ads generate revenue for the game developers. let\'s not get them rich off of terrible IN game ads.

    description: 'Become a celebrated sniper hero in American Block Sniper Survival. This brutal running and shooting action game stars you as a sniper of a deadly operation. Trek through a devastated war torn city in pursuit of the enemy. Only once your objective has been met can you all the mission a success. ****READY YOUR WEAPONS****They would descend upon villages, bringing fire and death with them. Grave after grave... I couldn\'t bear to be a part of that anymore. The issue was so big, so consuming, and the world had forgotten about the horrors confronted on the battlefield: a child\'s burnt sock on the side of the road, blood spattered alleyways, the haunting stench of death and the ring of a report playing on repeat in your head as you try to sleep at night... and the look on the target\'s face as the blood drained from his body.

      'Cool passtime. Several elements I recignize from series like Sid Meiers Civilization or the Settlers. The fights turn based combat. And the guilds are surprisingly helpful. The game offers some pay to win stuff but nothing you cant get with a little extra time. Nice game. 1 star taken because i have some issues launching it sometimes.',
       'Nice game, plays well. Only when you scroll the screen it keeps making a clicking sound if you touch a building doing so. Also, some free diamonds once in a while like in clash of clans would be nice. Give some free stuff then maybe people will be willing to spend some money',
       'The latest update "moved" Rogues from 1st on the list to "hidden" way back in the rest of the troops.  Very frustrating.   ALSO the fact that we can only "trash" or "use" rewards given to us in the Expedition.  Shows how worthless many of the rewards really are.  If we could sell them or trade them with others?  That would make them actually valuable.',
       'This game follows a typical progression. Early game moves fast so new players stick with game. Then there is a rapid slow down in the game where you either a. Spend real money to have anywhere close to the same sense of progression or b. Wait and wait and wait. Very quickly the game turns into logging on every 4 hours just to tap the screen a couple times and then exit. Eventually you won\'t play for a few days or maybe a week and then you log back on and tap the screen a few times and see that nothing has changed durring the week so you log off because you made no progress and are now bored. So you go delete the app and then write a review as honest as this one.',
       'The game is challenging and fun. Gave it 4 stars because you better not depend on the people who made the game. They are snotty and snobbish. They told me they couldnt be bothered to answer "basic" questions. The players have been super nice and helpful. The graphics are so, so amazing.',
       'I have seen the ads many times and just thought it was yet another ordinary game (pay-to-win).  However, I got curious and decided to give it a shot.  I started playing a couple of hours ago and I am hooked.  I am, literally, still playing it after starting...a couple of hours ago.  Very impressed so far and truly hope it doesn\'t turn out to be one of those games that loses its luster due to lack of resources and ends up requiring my hard-earned dollars.  Thank you for a great game and relaxing music.' ,

      'Good graphics, but the cheering when we catch a fish is annoying, and some species don\'t resemble the real fish , sea bass one of them. But is a ok game , in reality when I go fishing I like to listen the sea ,makes me feel relaxed ,it would be nice to be able to turn the cheering of and get a bit more of the sea sound.',
       'The game is good really enjoying it although the glitches and game crashes are annoying.. typical how it happens when you unlock something very important or try to get more coins watching ads or spend alot on upgrades... Untill the developer fixes this I wouldn\'t bother trying to play it seriously. Games ok for now if you want to fill some memory on you\'re device',
       'It was a good game entertaining good time killer but after playing it for a little while and reaching a certain level I can no longer open the game it opens and then crashes immediately would have gave it a lot more stars but after getting frustrated with the crashing I no longer like the game',

      'I want to give this game 5 stars and a better review but ever sense I had to change to a new phone and been trying to get my saved games it wont let me it starts loading then stops. I LOVE the stories and read many of them and even ape t alot of money on gems and tickets and now it basically wants me to start all the stories over again. If not fix I\'m going to have to not play anymore and just move onto another game.',
       'Love the stories. Chapters are shorter than other similar apps but so addictive. Cant wait for more content. Update: loving the update and the bonus diamonds. Please make it so once you complete them the reset. I am completely addicted to some of the stories. Still wish the chapters were longer since we only get one a week. Some books have longer chapters than others.',
       'This is one of my favorite story apps the stories are so unique and intense. You have to make some hard decisions sometimes but it\'s worth it. I personally think this better than episode and choices. The only thing is they do not update the stories as quickly as other apps. But I love it, very addictive',
       'I love nearly all the books. Most of the stories are so in depth, I get lost in the book. I love all the music and themes and even the rewards center. And prices for diamonds and tickets are really low. Keeps me playing for hours and really is a time killer. I would definitely recommend this game. You won\'t regret it !! Thank You crazy maple studio !!',
       'Love love love this game n stories in 1 is awesomeness!!!!!! Only 1 issue wouls b sometimes if u dont have diamonds u cant make the right choice ans it messes up the plot. The only way u get diamonds is 1 after every chapter or spend 5.00+ which i wouldnt mind if i had the money but u would end up using all with in 1 maybe 2 chapters... Other than that best game EVER!!!!',
       'I enjoyed interactive books as a child and do enjoy the stories but 1 diamond per chapter and the cost to make a choice so high (17 diamonds) makes choosing your own path impossible. I did start a story that ended at the climax. Not happy but giving another story a chance.' ,

      'I think its a great looking game, with great thought out gameplay. Despite this, there are some issues about the game, I would like to address.  1. The controls for the dodge are a bit iffy. Sometimes when I slide in the right place to dodge, it would to a lower punch, and get myself hit. I don\'t mind the slide to dodge mechanic, it just may need some tinkering  2. I wish the fighters had some unique moves, you know. To give some diversity in them. Or unique traits.   That\'s about it. If you want to reply you can. Other then this, this is a good game.',
       'Graphics are incredible, I absolutely love pixel games. It has a striking resemblance to Mike Tyson\'s Punchout, which I\'ve always wanted to play. I found a spelling error on the level 2 skills, no big deal just wanted to tell you. Love the controls, I use buttons because dodging is a little difficult on swipe mode, maybe make it a little more sensitive, It\'s hard to dodge if your swipe fails to dodge. Character customization is awesome, maybe add shirts, or at least tank tops. Also I love the lack of ads, it really makes the game more professional. Pvp mode would be cool also, I\'m excited for that update, and more updates. I will continue to support you, keep working hard on this game! Also, it would be cool if you could make it windows 10 compatible on pc.',
       'Amazing fantastic boxing game of all pixel 2d. its like ko fighters in java game but this is not sideview haha.pls add more hair, Beard,tattoo and some cool punching movements  tnx sorry for my english.um pls don\'t add tshirt because is not real boxing if u have shirt while boxing. Maybe add cool costume before fight is the best tnx',
       'I believe this game is absolutely amazing the face that they let you calibrate the sensitivity, button placement, Ability to have your own creativity with your fighter pure geneous I love how the developers take the time to listen to reviews and fix bugs! Great job guys.... P.S. I wasn\'t trying to dick ride but I love this game😭😭',
       'Good concept amd game design. The only thing that I find really frustrating is how unrewarding dodging is. The higher up I go, the less effective dodging is. The opponents up there just keep throwing punches. In real life, when someone like Floyd Mayweather Jr. dodges, he is able to land a fast jab back.',
       'Pretty amazing little boxing game. Totally satisfied the craving I was having. No annoying advertisements. With only two modes, matches could get a little repetitive after a while. That\'s really my only complaint.' ,

      'I am downgrading the app as you are not telling us what you doing in any of the upgrades. This is tantamount to being underhanded as your ads are becoming more and more obtrusive. You are also giving with the one hand and taking back with the other refer your recent cut to being able to go back and play previous months.',
       'I love this game generally. The graphics are fab. I love that you can personalise the background and cards. It\'s easy to use and follow. If I could add one thing,  it would be that the game tells you when you have run out of moves; it only seems to do that if you play the daily challenge.',
       'It was a nice surprise to be able to personalize the background, backs of the cards and the type of card face. The back ground I did with a picture created in Avakin Life, that I rather like.  Over all spider is spider, with a lot of settings to make it yours, not sure if it will play offline yet.',
       'After more than 500 consecutive completed challenges this game has become bad. It is no longer a game of skill, but a game of luck completing it exactly it the way it was programmed. I now have to make multiple undo to complete the game and sometimes four or more attempts to start over again.  Mobilityware games like crown and twin peaks are again just pure luck to complete like spider.',
       'I love this game.  It is addictive, but challenging when you want, or easier if you just want to chill without thinking.  It does have ads at the start of each game, and sometimes they are frustratingly loud, and some as long as 15 seconds before you can dismiss them, but they are less intrusive than some free games have.  I am happy that it does NOT freeze up like some games do.',
       'Mobilityware is not in control of its ads. The ads cause the game to freeze and player has to force close. Their support is of no use whatsoever. Gave them a month and numerous interactive messages to no avail. Good bye mobilityware. Find another company to enjoy the games.' ,

      'There is absolutely nothing new about this game except that you slapped the name "Crown" over Tri-peaks and called it a "new strategy game". I was really hoping for a solitaire game I hadn\'t played before. I\'m extremely disappointed. I\'m a HUGE fan of your regular solitaire game. Huge fan. But the name and description are misleading and it\'s embarrassing.',
       'It is fun to play. The first games I played when I got a computer, were solitaire games. I still like them better than ANY of the other games I\'ve played. I will be adding this one to that group. I like games that make you "think" rather than "time you" and you have to hurry. They make me too anxious. This game works for me. Thank you.',
       'I wish i knew if all games were solvable.  I like to play winning games and replay the deal until i can figure it out.  As it stands, i cannot tell if it is a winning hand so i move on if i lose more than a few times in a row on a single hand.',
       'I really enjoy the game, EXCEPT for the fact that there seems to be no way to turn off the ad sounds. Even setting my phone to mute won\'t mute the ads. It\'s intrusive and annoying, especially in a public place.',
       'You have the best solitaire games by far, I have almost all of them and I love everything about them!   Only one complaint on your solitaire and spider controls-----thev are not stationary (stationery) l.    Thanks. People love you!',
       'Maybe I\'m missing something because I see all these great reviews but it feels like half a card game. The hand takes less than a minute, and it\'s the same thing over and over. 60 seconds (maybe) of a game, then ad, then another 60 seconds, etc. Can\'t really go past a certain high score. Seems really pointless. I think I\'ll stick to normal solitaire.' ,

      'Well, I loved the looks of it. Seemed really fun so I downloaded it. Then I spent 30 min downloading the patches, to find out at the very end I didnt have enough space on my phone. Uninstalled as much as I could, and still didn\'t have enough space... Could have said in details of the game how much space it REALLY takes up... Would have been really nice to know.  -a not so happy consumer',
       'This is an awesome game. Play it.  @the devs: I have sent items purchased with blue  gems to other players a few times. No one noticed, as it gets lumped in with all the other mail as they hit "Collect All" or spam click each collect button. I\'m not expecting a way for them to praise me because I\'m so awesome - however, a way for the player who received it to distinguish it a bit more from all the other loot would make _me_ feel like it\'s not such a waste of blue gems.',
       'Addicting game with auto-questing and battling. You can choose to do it manually, which I do for boss fights. I don\'t have to buy anything from the shop, in fact, you get free gear every day! The graphics are amazing for a mobile game with it being an MMO. I have a Note 8, so it does run really well. I play with my monitor using SideSync for full screen awesomeness. There is a lot to do for all types of players, being in a guild doing dungeons reminds me of the old-school MMORPGs of sieging and doing weekly raids.',
       'Everything about this game is really good, but since this update today I can\'t even open the game it keeps closes and sending me to my home screen on my phone... Doesn\'t give me a error report or any messages just closes the app. Id really like to continue playing please fix . Galaxy S8+',
       'This was a good game until you guys lowered the monster core drop rate again with the latest update. It makes it hard for real gamers who play to earn to compete with others that pay to win. You guys really have no consideration for people that play the game on smartphones. With such low monster core drop rates it takes hours upon hours to make any progress and all those hours can cause a smartphone to get VERY hot. Unless this game comes with a phone replacement plan you guys need to fix the game.',
       'I saw this game and was a little skeptical. Felt like my phone would never handle such a thing if it was as good as it looks, well I\'m honestly surprised. Between the nice controls and not having to worry about grinding. To the somewhat intriguing story and overall playability of this game. I\'m very impressed. 5/5' ,
    recentChanges:

       '3) Open Siege and Fortress Siege regular season begins.',
       '4) 8 new Fortresses have been added for Fortress Siege.',

      'This is a very unique game, super cool concept and is very challenging. But as others mentioned, it could have been better executed. Though not the only thing meriting improvement, the hints are sometimes not relevant enough, and other times give it away instantly. I think the developers are onto something but it\'s not perfect yet.',
       'Good concept, but not enough visual clues/hints so that you feel like you\'re actually solving something. With nothing to go off of, it\'s more guesswork than actual puzzle solving. Or, like in the level where it very clearly displays the Bluetooth symbol, the hints are too obvious so there\'s no sense of accomplishment.',
       'I love the idea. It\'s a really cool aesthetic and using your phone settings to solve the puzzles is a really neat concept. My phone can\'t do all of these settings, unfortunately. It doesn\'t interpret when I take a screenshot and I can\'t take out my SIM card. Wish it worked with my phone :( (LG Stylo 3)',
       'I don\'t mind having to watch a video to earn a credit for tips. But to have me install a game that I\'m not interested in, thus leaving me stuck makes this less appealing. Otherwise, it was good while it lasted. But I\'m starting to lose interest.',
       'It\'s quite novel, but I wouldn\'t say there\'s anything to do with AI involved here. The prompts are nagging and the tone of the instructions are hardly ingraciating. You wanted a review and you got one.',
       'Honestly I\'ve had a ton of fun with this game. Some puzzles seem simple but still throw me off for awhile. Some are quick, and some take time (bypassed by changing phone time). They\'re all very clever and a new way to interact with a game' ,

      'The odds are set too low and the bets are set too high, hence you lose a lot of money fairly quickly. I\'m from Vegas and the "real comps" aren\'t worth my time nor effort. I\'m on a device for a reason= to play, not get wasted, not go down to the strip or casino, especially not waste real time and money. I just wish to be happy and play in piece. This doesn\'t keep me playing... Nor my attention long',
       'It is a good game but it is too tight to play for long.  It would also be better if you could get your bonus points more often.  By the way, could you see about getting the game that has the dragon that shakes the game and has a lot of random effects. I used to play it at the casino and it was always my favorite. I do like your game alot but it would be better to play longer. Thank you for the time I do get to play. It is fun.',
       'One of the stingiest free slot apps out there. I went through 1,000,000 tokens at 10,000 a bet and only hit the bonus round one time for 11,200 tokens. I had runs of almost 20 slot pulls with a single token winner. There are more fun slot apps out there that at least make you feel like you are winning something.',
       'There is a glitch that I have to login, logout and log back in and often lose the gift coins or tickets in the process. Only one game has paid out making it feel like trying new ones is not worth it.',
       'Was fun to start until I switched to a different slot machine. Now I\'m winning about every 15-20th spins and a minimal amount. Not fun when it\'s not worth it. I mean slots are supposed to pay out that\'s what makes it fun to play. Thumbs down!',
       'This is the best slots I\'ve played. The daily spin shouldn\'t be fixed though. It gives minimum 90% or more of the time. Been playing almost 800 consecutive days and the more you play the harder to increase level and receive gold coins. That\'s not rewarding loyalty.' ,

      'Come hit it big in our two new games – Power Boost Tree and Mammoth Power! The Wild Expand Feature in Power Boost Tree is sure to plant the seeds for success. Once a Wild symbol lands in the special golden frame, all other symbols within will transform into one massive Wild. Mammoth Power’s Free Spin bonus has huge potential too, transforming every Wild into a giant Wild multiplier. With bonuses that reach as high as 3X, it’s easier than ever to keep the wins rolling in.' ,

      'Money hungry devs. Makes promises to VIPs but don\'t deliver. Shoddy customer service with all answers given off a script but never really answer your concerns. Take plenty, give SFA back. Battery draining, laggy and constant bugs. Best decision I just made was to cancel my membership based on the fact that these people really do not GAF about their players, especially their VIPs when it is not a cheap membership to have.',
       'Definitely pay to win. Keeps kicking me out after doing about 2 levels. When you scroll up or down it thinks you are clicking on something. Stamina is a nightmare as when you reach a high enough level that takes more xp to level up, you can\'t play for hours as it takes to long to recharge. Other than that pretty good.',
       'Pay to win game. In reality you have to spend between 500-1000$ to get a decent deck for one deck (5 different element decks). Drop rates in packs are miniscule and cost around 44$ for a pack with 9/10 3 star and 4 star maximum cards. (Cards that are useful have a max of 6 stars). Customer support ALWAYS chooses money over the player.',
       'Well built foundation and cool artwork. But the stamina choking is absolutely inexcusable. As soon as level ups aren\'t regularly replenishing stamina get ready to play two levels every few hours. When are mobile game devs gonna realize this isn\'t an arcade, I\'m not putting in quarters just to *play* your game. If I loved your game, *maybe* I would spend money to buy a really cool rare unit, but never something as trivial and fleeting as stamina. Stop ruining your game\'s potential with such greedy freemium models.',
       'Everything, especially the text, is blurry. Graphics aren\'t big enough/high enough quality to look nice at 1440p. At the very least you guys need to replace the text to work better on high-res displays because it looks amateurish and outdated to be that blurry.',
       'Ok game but has annoying things like it pauses my music I\'m listening to even when I mute their music and check the box to use my own music. Everytime I open the app or go back to it, it pauses my music, and it keeps selecting items, cards or anything when I\'m just trying to scroll up or down the page. It keeps getting annoying when trying to get to the campaign and it selects different dungeons or whatever I am trying to scroll past.' ,

      'Ugh look people if u start playing this game oh wait if u had any sense u wouldn\'t. these adds are outrageous every time I die there an add I\'m not even kidding. My dad rates tones of games and I\'m the one playing some of them and I told my dad that these adds are so horrible I even had to report it. Now here me out great game but the adds. And in the beginning there is no instructions on how to do the game so like I said in the beginning there is a add at the end of every round so in the beginning there are many adds. Now i think there are more adds then game in this game. I\'m not trying to be mean so don\'t go crying😢 to ur boss.',
       'The game is stupid. I HATE IT. It\'s very annoying because of all the ads. It\'s sad that some people actually LIKE  games with all these ads. I mean, WHO would give this game 5 STARS? That would just be an idiotic thing to do. ZIGL, This game stinks. I mean, REALLY SKINKS. It stinks worse than DOG POOP. HOW DO YA LIKE ME NAH?! I\'m not trying to be mean ZIGL, But I\'m just giving my opinion. Thanks for reading ZIGL, don\'t get mad at me and go crying😢 to your boss. Bye!!🤙',

       'I like this game  very much cause you dont know what comes in front of you which makes this game more interesting. But 1 problem is there that the second i crash to any obstacle an add popups',
       'This game is the WORST!!! The controls don\'t work and there is not even demonstration on how to play. Also every time I retried to do it a stupid add came up. I AM FURIUS!!!! Do you expect me to have patience with this game? I hope not because I have no patience and this game totally pushed me to the limit and put me off playing on my tablet. If you do not want to be annoyed please don\'t get this app and if you do delete it straight away in my opinion. ( I don\'t mean to be rude but this game makes me very angry.) THE END!!!!!!!!!',
       'I really do like this game. It\'s a good way to learn to think quickly with what side you should move to. Although, it would be even better if you didn\'t have so many adds, but every rose must have it\'s thorns and I\'d say the adds are this roses thorns.' ,

      'I played it a long time ago and i stopted like 5 months ago. Then now i reinstalled it and:  1. I could not enter my acc  2. I could not connect to facebook or google play.  3. I had to pay each time i danced wich sucks.  Till that update this game was the best game/app ever. It was so fun and so great that I just wanted to play nonstop.  I mean before this big update u payed for a song and u could dance on it as much as you liked. Now it just ain\'t fun anymore.   Please return to the classic game or your gonna lose much much more players like me.',
       'I like it, I use it to exercise and have fun with my sister. Only question I have is: How accurate is the kcal Burned counter? I played for over an hour and I am told I burnt 1,252 KCals. I question the accuracy of this. You update the game often, so can you put in the game somewhere the average calories the song the user is choosing to play burns? That is my biggest concern. Otherwise, no issues. Fun, easy to use. Great way to get exercise in all the while enjoying it with family and friends.',
       'Game is good as all just dance video games. Daughter enjoyed it until noticed that she had only a few dances then had to wait. There should be at least a shorter time to wait. Or some sort of option to earn more coins. Because 2 videos weren\'t enough. And one of them didn\'t work because the connection was lost. Again game was okay as for game play. But not sure its a keeper.',
       'It\'s fun to do and this game is perfect for me because I love to dance. Dancing is my favorite thing to go when I\'m bored. I love the songs and dance moves it\'s awesome to play and do. Thx for making this game cause now I can do more dancing and dance moves. You guys should download this game for you new people cause it\'s awesome to learn but in a fun way. So if you suck and don\'t know how to dance then you should download this game it\'s perfect for you if you want to know how to do simple but hard dancing moves.',
       'Honestly, the game is great. It loads good, has amazing graphics and is easy to play. However the credits situation is absolutely retarded. I feel as if we shouldn\'t have to wait twenty-four hours to play ONE dance then wait again or pay $2.99 per DAY just to dance. You should at least have a page of good free dances for when someone has nothing to do!',
       'I really enjoyed playing this... Or at least the two songs I was able to play based on the coins that I had. My only criticism so far is that there should be ways to earn coins other than waiting so long for refills, watching ads, or buying coins. This strict control on earning coins doesn\'t make this a great game to play with a group of friends (though I know that you can buy VIP passes which are valid for a limited amount of time). It would add to the game play (as well as the overall experience of the game) if coins could be earned during the game in power ups or when you get perfect scores. This would give incentive to keep playing, let the games potentially last longer, and add to the competitiveness between players to enhance gaming fun.' ,

      'Great game for its genre. However it desperately needs some events maybe a daily login bonus and some form of vip ladder. I like the nostalgic of the old game but I feel like the developers made the game and just walked away from it. Please for love of games add new stuff and throw some events to us who are almost maxed out. This happens and I\'m totally cool with a 5 star rating',
       'Best game in years and I especially love the character jam and there are many more for you to collect they are worth the get even when your scroundging around for the last few characters. Also it\'s crazy how much they throw at you for watching an ad It can give you 20 diamonds to 8 hours of cash it\'s insane',
       'Fun game, cool animations and graphics. Good music and sound effects. Can you help with diamonds and sell out features just a tad bit more. I enjoy the game. Awesome job developers and programmers. Nice twist on the classic crazy taxi game',
       'This is a great time killer. It\'s a pretty fun game and easy to play. My only complaint is that you have to watch a zillion videos to get bonuses, which really wouldn\'t be that bad if you got the bonuses after watching the videos. It seems like the higher the level I reach the more frequently this happens. Fix this issue and I\'ll give it 5 stars.',
       'Great game, it\'s fun to play. Would rate it higher, but it often crashes when I\'m trying refuel or double my earnings by watching ads. Then the game restarts, and I can\'t refuel for awhile, or I list the bonus earnings. FRUSTRATING!!',
       'I was playing a game when this ad came up with a fake X so that it would take you to the play store. I hate shady practices like this so I installed it just so I can give you this review. Enjoy your single freak\'n star!  PS This is not a review of the game itself and I could care less at this point. This review is on this games advertisment tactics.' ,

      'This is a really great version of flappy bird, ive been finding apps just like this! BUT...one problem, too much ads! Pls fix this so i could give you a complete five star rating! xox',
       'Its great bit too many ads, but mainly  game is  awesome! I would really recommend it!! It also kills time like u Just can\'t stop playing.',
       'I don\'t like this game as it is just the same thing and there is noting that you can change like your character, background, ect. It\'s ok for little kid if they need to practise accuracy bit there\'s just nothing that make this game stand out',
       'I think that the graphics are bad and that flappy jumps too much when you tap him. It is still a good game bit it needs more work. Also there is too many adds. One after every two games',
       'This game is very good, almost like the real Flappy Bird™ The only thing I can say about it that I don\'t like is the graphics, they aren\'t very good. But overall, I really like the game! My highscore is 101! I recommend you get this game! 😀',
       'I like this games although I find it a bit hard because one minute the poles are high and then the next minute they are really low. The birds could be colourfuller and yeah it isn\'t a bad game so I think I would actually recommend it. It would be an all 5 star but in the graphics or the pictures they are a bit boring and not that colourful.' ,

I\'ve downloaded it again today, and it hasn\'t even loaded, it just says something about my internet connectivity.... My connection is absolutely fine.  Oh dear guys, the most simple of things, and it can\'t even do that. Come on!  UPDATE: I submitted a ticket, and no one even acknowledged me 😂 this is laughable Kabam 😂',
       'After the recent update the game has some connectivity problems. Even now my internet connection is perfect for other use but the game replies me with low connectivity & really hate when it happens during gameplay. Kindly solve this issue. Otherwise i loved this, A decent & perfect action game!👍',
       'Well, i love the game, now explanation of 4stars. I\'d gladly rate it 5 stars if you fix the issue, anytime i buy a special offer (daily) i never receive my red shards, i just bought a crystal and it also was supposed to come with a 1000 5star shards and i did not receive the shards. FIX THIS DAMN THING. You cost me a 5star hero.',
       'Everything used to be a 5* but with the March 1st update the game has become a total money grab. You nerfed just about every champ some to the point of being unusable. In order to complete content now you will have no choice but to throw hundreds if not thousands at this game. Until kabam addresses this issue tenfold it\'s #boycottmcoc don\'t waste a single dime on this game.' ,

      'Love this game! How about pet machine which gives you a random pet when you use it? You could pay 500, 750 or 1000 gems to spin, and it will give you a new pet! There could be 51 pets, 20 common, 15 rare, 10 ultra rare, 5 legendary ones with super powerful attacks and one golden for fully upgrading the safe,pet food, plant and books! Some ideas for pets are zombie, noob, turret from  the portal series, a cloud and mini versions of the bosses! Thanks!!!!',
       'Why this would happen!? I can\'t get my favorite weapons in the cellar, what is the point? The weapons include staff of flame, laser sword red, laser, flame axe, and dragon bros sniper rifle. Plz let me get them right away, and this game is cool so i rated it 3/5',
       'Best rogue-like multiplayer game that I\'ve played so far. Hotspot connection just needs a little tinkering on it, always disconnects even if all the players are just right beside the host. Aside from that, two thumbs up for the devs. Looking for an mmorpg with the same gameplay, but open world. Hopefully in the future you guys can make one.',
       'The game is great, however it crashed after I purchased the Druid...  purchased gems were not appearing and game will always freeze. I tried updating but the problems remained... after thinking about it I decided to uninstall and reinstall... and all my progress was lost... just like the purchases I made before... I cannot even access the Vampire I bought before... terrible storage management... most app use the google account to keep track of whatever you gain through in app purchases',
       'Soul knight is a rouge-like game that involves 1-4 players traversing throughout multiple floors to reach a stolen gem. Along the way, the players may find a weapon that will lead to victory! Or a toilet plunger that launches exploding S***...a-always a good time... anyway. This game is a mighty good time. Keep up the good work (thanks for the 4 player support ^v^)',
       'This is my first time reviewing an app so listen up. I\'ve been playing this game for a very long time and I have unlocked most of the characters but after sometime I uninstalled it, after about a month or so I re-installed it again because of the new update, particularly interested in 4 player multiplay, but... My data is GONE. I\'d give this game straight 5\'s but please fix this first. Anyways, the game is really really great. But pls guys, my data.' ,

      'I am stunned. I thought it was going to be a good game from the start because of the beautiful art but everything exceeded my expectations! The scenery is honestly so pretty I would just stop and imagine myself in the beautiful world and ponder. The music surprised me as well, it\'s so full of feeling and gets you very well into the mood. Lastly, the story was beyond interesting. It was very exciting to learn a bit about these myths and legends. Overall, the experience was amazing and I would recommend this game to everyone.',
       'The graphics are too good. Especially when you reach certain points and can suddenly communicate with spirits. It\'s amazing. If you\'re looking for casual adventures for android, this game does the job. Yes, the hints are given, but you are adviced to solve things yourself till you can\'t get any logic at all for the best experience. Good job, Snow Cannon Games. I want more like these. I\'m sure everyone else who\'s played this, wants so too. Please make a similar one on the Aztec Culture.💖',
       'This is so far, 2018, one of the most stunning games I\'ve had the privilege to play. Upon opening it I decided that I was going to record my play through and let others see how gorgeous this game is. I get excited to play it. The puzzles are challenging and really make you think while the graphics and voice acting immerse you this other world where spirits roam and the Old Gods still rule. Thank you to those who had a hand in making this game. 10/10',
       'OH ME LAWD. It\'s been such a long time since i found a game on play store that i could label "good". The art style is beautiful, story was captivating but my favorite part was the audio. Sound effects are amazing, the voices i could listen to all day although i don\'t know what language that was. Is there somewhere i could just listen to the warriors singing? They didn\'t sing words but it was still so relaxing to me. I feel like the game is a masterpiece and deserves hundred times the attention that it is getting. Kudos devs',
       'This is a classic point and click adventure game based on Norse mythology. Beautiful graphics, atmospheric sound, music and voice-overs. No stupid hidden object puzzles like in so many other point and click games nowadays, this game is reminiscent of Myst. I really missed a map with teleportation feature though, as you end up constantly running around from one end of the world to the other. A journal where the game automatically saves photos of the clues would have been really helpful as well, had to take screenshots myself. It\'s not overly long either. Otherwise a thoroughly enjoyable game, and it\'s completely free.',
       'It\'s honnestly been such a long time since I had that much fun playing a mobile game. The atmosphere is thrilling, the story is great, the graphics are perfect and the music is incredibly good. I can\'t help but praise this game. It must be because I\'m really into Norse mythology but nonetheless, it sure is an awesome game. The only issue I could bring up would be the long trips from one place to another: if you\'re at one end of the map, going to the other is quite a pain. Anyway, hats off.' ,

      'Its rlly a good game for brain training!! Idk why but i didnt find any bug, glitch, or smthing like they all saying. It works well in my device. This is the best app for training your brain. Ofc its not easy, its so challenging, in a good way. I rlly struggle in quick searching and some stages, but its just so addicting and so great!! I recommend you to download it!!!',
       'It\'s fun. My problem is on the attention one we are suppose to click stop once the red dot is on the brain and I do. There is plenty of time to click it  but it tells me i missed it. No matter how many times I click it while the red dot is still on the brain. If I press it 10 times then the screen that tells me I\'ve failed comes up 10 times. Driving me insane.',
       'There\'s a glitch in "Quick Decision Skill" game. It is based on whether the previous and current object is same or not. When I click on the peach-moon-type object as same, it gives error, though I click on Same when two moons appear consecutively in the game. This way I\'ll not be able to clear the levels.',
       'I love it!!! The games are interesting. Now I am on "memory match" game which was initially locked and it keeps on freezing and promotes me to next level without me completing the level well. Besides that, I would highly recommended it to others, it\'s worth installing.',
       'Hi, no support team is there, i have a problem- Not able to play Multi tasking game, its hanged - not scrolling after 3rd level, plz help me to play, need to complete tht game, other than this all r gud game to play. Intrsted to play , but no challenging all r very easy to complete the levels',
       'Things I think can be done just like that are not that easy.. The app just revealed the poor state of my memory/IQ.. And it has been help me to develop my thinking.. Nice App' ,

      'This game has highly disappointed me.  It was super fun and interactive at first then it gives you the option to pay to continue to play or to complete free offers to unlock the game for free.  I have found that you can complete as many offers ad you want but the game won\'t ever unlock and emailing the support web site doesn\'t do any good either. They don\'t ever respond and it is a complete waste of time.  Don\'t waste your time on this game.  Go out and find yourself something worth playing because this surely isn\'t it.',
       'DO NOT DOWNLOAD CAN NOT BE COMPLETED DUE TO A BUG!!!!!!  After buying you eventually get to the accordion level just before leaving the prison roof only for one (or 2 on some phones) ball being outside the play area which makes the mini game impossible.  Many reviews all over the internet highlighting this bug but the developer has not bothered to fix it.  AVOID THIS DEVELOPER !!!!!!!!!!',
       'It was super fun and interactive at first then it gives you the option to pay to continue to play or to complete free offers to unlock the game for free.I tried  to complete many offers such as surveys, installing a playing another game for certain level, but this game never unlocked no matter what! They don\'t ever respond and it is a complete waste of time. This game has highly disappointed me.',
       'It\'s fun in the begin it has a great starting puzzles.. they are challenging but interesting.. until you get to put your plans in place and then find out you can\'t continue unless you pay for hints or you do unnecessary task using other apps.. I found this feature pointless because I don\'t even use the hints but the producers are making me extra hard to get them.. it\'s a bunch of b.s. at this point I am unhappy with how they set this part up.. don\'t install you\'ll be disappointed unless you have money to spend that for no reason',
       '"Free" version lets you play minimal levels. I then completed 2 different offers to get the whole game. After spending an hour on each offer, still haven\'t been given access to the full game. Game is a joke and makers are a fraud. Waiting for something to happen to my info that was added to the offers.',
       'Game is ok.  Tasks are sometimes unclear.  After a few tasks you have to pay to keep going or complete some offer.  Tried several times, but never lets me continue.  Should say it\'s a trial version in description.  No clue how it got a 4+ star rating.' ,

       'Used to be my favorite game.  The latest update completely changed the character of the game.  The ball is faster, bouncier, and everything is smaller, and it all adds to just randomness.  The AI got worse at the same time, so it\'s not really harder... just more random.  I now find that this game stresses me out instead of helping me relax, so I have to give it up.',
       'Stale gameplay with nothing interesting. AI sucks. Lv 27 has little difference from lv 1. Too boring. Time to rid this trash from my phone at least I bothered playing with AI till lv 27. I wonder if there is even a end game or maybe the level keeps increasing aimlessly without any interesting change. Bored to max.',
       'First version was my favourite thing to play but the update looks like a different game entirely. The ball got too small and the physics became stupid and random',
       'This game is really bored! I\'m so stress! I lose and second you lose again why Glow Hockey is bored a bored game! But like it. I\'m nervous to play because you lose... but I\'m happy..',

      'It was fun while it lasted. I was a big fan of the first game and this one was an awesome improvement. Unfortunately my game crashed after months of playing and forced me to play the tutorial again. When I was finally able to check my cloud save it was overwritten by the tutorial. I\'ll probably uninstall the game since it\'s not worth it if I lose my progress again.',
       'Excellent game. I am totally addicted to it. Developers can you please include a reload button. Also sometimes playing I hit a wall or fence and it becones impossible to move left or right. In that case moving a couple of steps backward coukd save us in the game. Please include these options for making the most out of it. Overall its an excellent game and I highlh recommend it.',
       'Update! I spoke with the PikPok sevice team they fixed everythimg! Thanks guys! After getting to a certain level the game froze on the start up screen. Reinstalled and lost all my progress.',
       'Love this game. Only issue is it does lag sometimes. Other than that it\'s very fun.  Great customer support also. Had an issue after an update where I lost most of my weapons but customer service made it right and then some!',
       'sorry for my bad english. your game is really great. but i found some ingame bug issues while playing. hope if some one in dev team read this review, you could fix them. while reloading, if you hit something like a tree, a truck, a stump,... the loading animation will stop. and sometime, while starting loading a shotgun (mostly bug found while using shotgun), that mean no bullet in the gun yet, i suddenly hit a tree, and it stop loading, so, i cant finish my challenge, have to die and star from the beginning. it\'s ,somehow, really annoying. and sometime, i reloaded the backup gun already, but when the main gun is out of ammo, it auto switch to the backup gun, but, it empty, that\'s mean death. hope you guys fix it soon.',

Bad enough wins are rare and small as it is without them taking it away when you do win and to top it off you cannot contact support as it continuously comes up error. Not acceptable',
       'This game was fun until the last update, for some reason I just can\'t win now, had over 2 million and have been playing for a couple of days and now have only 80 thousand. If this is your way of trying to make me buy coins, it\'s not happening. Maybe if I was still winning I would of but now I think I\'m just gonna delete this game, thanks for ruining the fun!',
       'As soon as you hit level 45 you can\'t win. 3 days and I haven\'t won anything,  just spin and loose',

      'This Is A Good/Fun Game To Play If You Are Bored. I Just Downloaded It A Few Minutes And I\'m Already Up In Ranks. I Love Arcery And Guns. This Game Puts Both Of Them Together That\'s Good For Me. I Rated This Game A Full 5☆',
       'Lots of fun. Simple yet difficult to master. I play everyday. I like the variety of targets. Purchasing option doesnt work. I tried to buy $4.99 of coins in the app. It took my money  but it never added the coins to my score. Google Play credited the amount back to me. Good app overall.',
       'This Game was very exiting and relaxing  and spend time with shooting king with archers I like Guns  and the bullet was very Big and the level is 100000 I think I will pay every day First higher stakes multiplayer and it appeared with the opponent cheated the time ran out from the shoot but the Game was froze. But the Game was very interesting and exiting I like shooting very much',
       'First higher stakes multiplayer and it appeared that the opponent cheated. The time ran out for them to shoot but the game then froze. I was able to change guns, sent emotes, etc. and I was connected to a stable internet connection. I waited 20 minutes until finally sending the game yo the background so I could google if it was a cheat. Low behold I instantly lost all of my coins. Dont waste your time with this game, poorly made and cheaters will take all of your coins in multiplayer.',
       'Uninstalled after 10 mins. Too many pop ups for other games plus the lengthy ads that you can\'t get out of. Great game otherwise.',
       'It is about slowly balancing your gun to release and take the shot within a set time limit but not quite as easy when you actually try. This makes it a challenge to perfect hand eye coordination so that makes for a good game.' ,

      'I normally don\'t write reviews for mobile games but this is a very fun Yu-Gi-Oh! game to play with friends. It is challenging and engaging. Only 3 monsters and spell and trap cards at a time is a little weird. Not weird enough to take enjoyment from the game. I am still early in it but so far I am pleased. The only downside I can see. If you buy a themed pack it is strange most the cards have nothing to do with the theme and only getting three cards out the pack. That I would change. Still though I am still pleased with the game.',
       'It\'s an ok game if you like Yu-Gi-Oh. If you like the real card game, this game is similar to it. However, there are a few changes that you might not like in the game. 3 monster card zones and 3 spell/trap zones. Very simple and easy to pick up. The game has boosts you can use, but aren\'t really worth it until you pay to get further. Konami is just being Konami( take yo money, cha-ching)',
       'I\'ve dowloaded this game before and loved it, but I deleted it after a while. My friend encouraged me to get it again, so I\'ve been trying to. Trying. Once you download the app, there\'s 358 I-don\'t-know-what\'s that you have to download. This is currently my fourth day trying to download them. If my phone turns of or I exit out of the app in any way, everything I\'ve downloaded so far doesn\'t save. I\'ve probably attempted to download this seven times already. I do not recommend even downloading this with poor wi-fi.',
       'Is a game wish make my dream come true without even need to spend a single money .... No need to buy the cards which need cash... Just buy cards using gems that\'s enough.... Only weird thing is there is only 3 slot in monster and spell/trap slot.... In real Yu Gi Oh is always five... But this one is a bit special... But overall.... This game is actually free and very enjoyable..... Even better than spending cash on buying real cards..',
       'Im currently lvl 51. And has been playing for 2 yrs now. All i warn here is it\'s too addicting because with the addition of new characters to play and the GX, it reminds you of both of Yu-gi-oh and GX anime series. Currently have the 2 god cards. Waiting for the last piece of it. Lols. This game also, i would say, got better and always getting better as time goes by. Love this game. Thanks Konami. You can still lvl up and enjoy this game without spending any penny. But you have to work for it though, but it\'s worth it.',
       'It\'s fun, for the most part. Till you get to the drop rates for booster boxes.  How can you spend every gem you earn and still manage to avoid getting any of the actually decent cards in the box?  Most of my decks are still running off the initial booster packs I got in the beginning.  Seems kinda... Just okay. Sorry.' ,

      'I wish I could give this game 10 stars. It\'s amazing all around.  It\'s adorable and fun. The graphics are amazing too without any glitches so far. Haven\'t noticed any bugs either. The developer\'s done amazing. It does get repetitive after a while but so far by the time it happens something new unlocks so it\'s still fun. Can\'t wait to see what else you guys do to improve the game play since everything else has been flawless so far. Great job, keep up the great work!',
       'This game is super cute! I love my lil ninja friend! Lol. Nice story, and plenty to do to keep you busy. Will def take time to master, but it def has the potential to keep you interested in playing. Even got my wife playing it, and she usually only keeps games for a day or 2, cuz she gets bored with them. I think she\'ll play this one a little longer than most of the other games she\'s tried. I\'m really happy i found this game!!',
       'This one is probably my favourite, with minecraft and clash of clans. If you don\'t have this Virtual Friend game, then it is you who is missing out. Install and enjoy. There\'s nothing bad about this game, and if Naturalmotion do want me to suggest an add-on, then maybe enable me to link the game with a new device. I was LVL 52 once but I lost it. Now I\'m level 17. Hope you liked the suggestion. :)',
       'I love this game, it\'s simple and sweet. However, there was a middle row in the item-picking menu in which I had invested many coins into to help me level up faster. Today, when I logged in, the row simply disappeared without a trace. I tried restarting my phone and clearing the backgrounding of my app, but nothing seemed to fix it. Now I only have the Training row and the Fun stuff row. It took me quite a while to get those coins and I\'d really appreciate it if you brought the row back or gave me a solution to get it back. If it helps, you should also know that the \'I\' on every icon which used to let you see how an item was used has also vanished. Please fix this, thank you.',
       'You should add a dog and a cat wearing ninja suit they can be like the chicken and the squirrel the dog can run around you and bark and find bones and sell them for coins and the cat can find fish and sell it for coins. It just sounds like a good idea  the dog should be a husky or a smaller dog like a beagle so it is small like the other animals and it can sleep with the ninja the cat can just be a cat please look into this *^* looking forward to this',
       'This is a great game that I\'ve played off and on over the years. I just redownloaded it, and it\'d still fun to play. My only gripe is that there\'s no place to save your progress. Cloud, Facebook, etc. I hate having to start from level 1 every time I have to wipe/switch phones. Even an account that saves your data would be great. Fix this and it\'ll be 5 stars all the way for me.' ,

      'Thank you HQ Trivia for restoring my extra life when it disappeared  randomly. The game is great fun, the glitches have become very minor as with other popular apps. HQ updates often and as long as you keep up with updates and have a decent wifi connection there really isn\'t an issue with the gameplay. We look forward to it everyday!!',
       'Almost everytime I play it glitches by questions showing up late or not at all, getting kicked out while waiting for the game to start. It would be better if they got that fixed soon, along with having less questions about America and more international questions.',
       'Except the fact that Scott is the only host that I like, the only negative thing I have to say about this game is that super easy questions seem to be widely missed (like 10k people giving a wrong answer when a kid could easily answer), so I have a feeling that the questions are rigged. Other than that, great game, lots of fun times, lots of bad words said. 8/10',
       'Cool concept, maybe some questions could be better though! Super helpful customer services if you ever need help',

      'I absolutely love this game. It\'s so addictive and a really good game if your bored. I\'m really curious to find out what happens when you have collected all the balls, does the game just carry on or is their more challenges?? Overall, this game gets five stars from me 😚',
       'Its a really good game. The only thing is, that I wish there was maybe some instructions that appear at the beginning, because I didnt know that you couldnt hit the black lumps etc. Maybe if you add little phrases that say what to do and not to do, then it would be almost perfect.',
       'Great time killer I love everything about it and it is a great game to wake up to. The only down side is that you fall off the ledge and that makes it harder to dodge the black. Everything else is 5 stars so that is what I think about roller coaster.',
       'This game is amazing! It is addicting and fun to play!! The only thing is that I was hoping for some sort of introduction to the game, to tell me how to play etc. Also, I was hoping to be able to choose what kind of ball i use, the black one is plain and kind of boring. But overall its an amazing game!!',
       'Its really fun and addictive. Awesome game play and good for passing time. Not always so friendly to my battery and too many adds. Other than those little hick ups I absolutely love it.',
       'Loved everything about it! Only one thing, there are a few times you cant see where your going when the camera changes and you die sometimes because of it.' ,

      'Got too allgegro madness. And got stuck with the no face cards. 14 cards is alot to get. In fairway blast the card suits stick until a new none face card comes up, or reshuffles them. I find with this game they dont stick when the next card is turned over. So your run ends. And the run cards you ave accumulated as returned back to one agan.',
       'I totally love this game, but there\'s always aye glitch and then it blanks out so I have to reinstall the app multiple of times so I could keep playing.. So maybe admin you could take a look at it for us please as I would totally love to keep playing this game as its a great game to play especially when your winning down after such along day.. Thanks',
       'I love solitaire games, but this game is impossible. The first rounds will be easy, and then you\'re hit with ridiculous difficulty and straight up unwinnable games, that is, unless you spend money to get power ups that shouldn\'t even be necessary. 100% pay to win game. Which I find very sketchy. I\'ll never download anything from these developers ever again.',
       'PLEASE change where the 5 extra card for 2000 bucks is! I love this game but when you\'re short on money and you accidentally press it.... aaaaarggh. I\'m pretty sure others don\'t like where it is either. Could be a perfect game. And I spend hours a day on it as I\'m bedbound. Please...',
       'It\'s a fun game!! can keep you very entertained only thing that sucks is if you have it on PC or iOS there are way more features and it\'s way better than the Android version!!😢 So the side note is for the developers at Big Fish Games....... So I think we\'ve all waited way too long it\'s time to step it up and come out with a greater Android version at least make it as good as the iOS version!!!!!?????',
       'Game keeps blacking out which is frustrating.  Sometimes I get my progress back when I reinstall and sometimes I don\'t.  But love the game.' ,

      'This game is awsome!  Controls and graphics can be a little laggy,  but the large amount of tracks and cars to unlock and play around with makes up for it. My favorite car is the Duke Wagon Classic, nitro-charged, with a v-8 dropped into it.  Will kick butt in any race or derby! My only suggestion would be on the physics of the cars... Instead of having the bodies simply crush and get smaller/deformed, it would be cool to see body panels and  small pieces like lights and mirrors fall right off. Just a thought. Also it would be cool to have more big station wagon type cars.',
       'Love love love it!!! Best part is that is continuously surprises you with hidden coins and tricks in test drive play and you keep trying for more. Hope they continue to add more modes to the game!! Its easy to get whichever car you desire with the right race choice (the shorter the race the better) plus once you pay for a color or tire you don\'t have to buy it again for another vehicle. Love the winter and city modes. Keep it up!! My favorite vehicle is the FordGT lookalike lol =D',
       'In racing it\'s needs work if you lap the other cars it places you in last.. Happened twice now costing me 14000 coins.  I can\'t help that I\'m faster',
       'Very competitive and its hilarious if youre playing against opponent. Would nice if some racing level is free. Love it you dont to pay more coins for paint and all the orher stuff..awsome',
       'You are given some tiny very slow cars in the beginning, and you can either pay or play A LOT to get a decent car. And there are ads. Oh, and new tracks won\'t open automatically, you must buy them as well.',
       '2 thing to say.... My favorite car is a Chevy Silverado pickup 1997 and another thing.... BEST GAME EVER PLEASE MAKE ANOTHER ONE! PLZ! I LOVE YOU GUYS SO MUCH!' ,

       'Would be a great game if it would stop crashing! Wanna double up on the money you\'ve collected? Sorry, game crashed. Want to get the Ice Cream truck going for bigger profits? Sorry, game crashed. Good game, right until it sucks. Would even be enticed to spend a little real cash if the game money I should be earning would actually be there. But alas no, the game crashed.',
       'Gave 3 stars on some area because i lost my city and i don\'t know what happened and how i can get it back. I hope someone from game dev will help and I\'ll the game a full 5 star rating.',
       'This game in my opinion is the best game out there cause you really don\'t have to pay for everything you can earn diamonds on the regular and a good amount of coins you don\'t have to wait weeks or months to earn and build and evolve if I was going to put this game in a category it would be the equile category because your treated and earn everything equally I more then love this game because of that not because of the addiction this game has the style and features and momentum that no other game will ever have thank you so much',
       'Has daily rewards, not necessarily keep playing or keep online. Check regularly is good too. I don\'t really like the card type building, like leveling up from gatcha, but, the odds for free player is good enough in this game. All in all, great game.' ,

      'When I first downloaded this game, there were some issues, such as not being able to sync this game. So when I had to do a factory reset on my phone, it removed my stats. So after completing just over 600 games, and all the daily challenges, with over 110 "hints" and then having to do the reset, wiped out everything. The game kept going back to the first level when I selected next level after removing my stats. I uninstalled the game. Not going through each level again. It would be a much better game if it allowed syncing or even saving.',
       'Would be a great game to pass time if there werent an ad every 5 seconds. Seriously an ad when you click on options? Thats just greedy and stupid. Id give this less than a star if i could',
       'Like the game BUT WAY TO MAMY ADS. No game needs this many ads, I can\'t do anything without an ad popping up. It is really getting on my last nerves, ecut down the amount I don\'t mind a few but not that many.',
       'The amount of ads is ridiculous! Especially from that "Tune Blast", it\'s really annoying. And, w/some of the ads you have to wait 30sec before they\'re done, there\'s no "x" button. The actual mahjong game itself is decent.',
       'Overall, I love the game. The only thing wrong is that there\'s too many ads! I can\'t even go from menu to menu without an ad popping up. It\'s very irritating.',
       'It would be better if there were more tile choices, besides the basic 3. What really annoys me is that if you pause for a few seconds to look up or think of a move, an ad pops up. A 30 second, non skipable ad. The ads are also there after you finish every match. I know you need to make revenue but jeez. Calm down.' ,

      'This is a super fun game with a really riveting storyline. I love the set up, and how you don\'t need to pay to get further in the story. The biggest frustrations for this game are the wording and descriptions on some of the items (combs and brushes get swapped quite a bit as an example. So I\'ll lose a round when I was looking for a brush, only to discover via hints that the picture was of a comb.) and hit-box size (I\'ll go to click one item but not quite hit it and get penalized for it.) So while it\'s not perfect and can still use some improvement, it\'s a really great game. I highly recommend it if you like item search games and I can\'t wait to see what\'s in store for the future!',
       'One of the best games I\'ve ever played. My only issue is right now I can\'t get the my next case to open... I did already email you but just in case I\'d like to see if you can help me out with this. If it helps, I updated the game this morning.',
       'I LOVE THIS GAME!! I can\'t wait until new cases come out! I wonder if there\'s romance in the game? I would LOVE to date Dale(or Mulder)! I only have a problem with waiting for hours to see results on fingerprints and stuff like that. Keep up the great work!!!',
       'The progress fallback fix didn\'t work. My case is still reset and 2 of the search games are classified, yet it doesnt say that the next case is locked although it does still not allow me to play it. Please fix and i will rate 5 stars because this is a good game and i dont want it to go to waste',
       'This game is pretty awesome. I gave it a 2-star review because the game has made me start over from scratch 2 times in the last week. Very frustrating.',
       'I have played similar games like Criminal Case, this doesn\'t seem to be well optimized, It has crashed several times on the First Case. I have tried clearing cache, my tablet has over 12gb of free space, over 600mb RAM. It crashed 2 or 3 times on the same scene. I will try installing the latest update, but I think you need to get better at debugging your software.' ,

      'I dig it overall. The controls to set the pieces take a bit of getting used to, but I understand why they did it this way. Your finger starts where it should, but moved slightly lower than the finishing point. This way your finger is out of the way and you can clearly see where your piece is going. Very fun game with lots of options.',
       'A bit too difficult to work out. Good game but sometimes the positioning of beams just didn\'t seem to lock on the way it was suggested they should during tutorial parts. Tried multiple times but chucking the towel in on this one.',
       'The game\'s alright, the good part is especially to see the vehicle going through the bridge! Overall, It\'s an awesome game. Might not be the most awesome, but this is one of the games you\'d play to pass the time',
       'I really like this game, but when I got the 10 dollar upgrade, it said purchased failed and charged me. You robbed me from 10 dollars and if I don\'t get what I paid for soon. I\'m going to be infuriated...',
       'Great game with 1 small issue... you can only play this game if you have great WiFi or no WiFi because if you use bad WiFi (school or restaurant WiFi) it will load forever unless you turn it off. Great game though',
       'To start of it\'s the best bridge builder that\'s free and the physics are funny when it comes to ramps.and monster trucks because one flipped over while it got to the finish line and boy was it funny and i loved the gmaeplay and that\'s why i gave it 5 stars.' ,

      'Well guys.. I just broke the game 😂 it was the \'HEADLIGHT\' puzzle where I got stuck. I requested for a hint and I accidentally tapped out the E in it and now it\'s completely gone. There\'s no letter E no more in there. You should check this out. (So I requested a hint twice, went wrong on the word and then tapped E, and poof, it\'s gone) and maybe you should make a reset puzzle button for situations like this. 😃',
       'Very easy, boring and full of unskippable ads for no reward. Not a very clever game as some have suggested, this gives the player no sense of accomplishment nor any legitimate challenge unless you do not speak English.',
       'Just got really boring. In a group of 10 puzzles there was; 1 that was a clever brain teaser, about 7 that were just way too easy and severely lacked creativity, and at least 2 that were just genuinely terrible often making little to no sense whatsoever and then it just turned into a game of hangman with unlimited guesses. Clearly this was made by a team or individual who thinks that they are supper clever and witty but in reality just wanted to make a few easy bucks by showering people with adds and a completely unnecessary currency system.',
       'The best time spent by playing this game ... Some are easy, some are funny, some are tricky, some are still out of the mind.... But it\'s a wonderful game and waiting for more levels to come now...',
       'After completing 55 levels I get a blank screen. Are there any plans to add new levels?',
       'Its a great gane but is always glitching out.For example I have three leters after I use a hint,then I earn a hint and the other letter just disapears and it did not go onto the word or phrase.' ,

      'I love playing the game but there are so many updates all the time. And when they do their bimonthly update you have to download new package and then some gameplay features dont work. I have had a couple things not work from last update. I tried to contact support and they havent replied at all. Its been three days now. Im an everyday player who spends real money in game. Would rate higher if someone would help me out..',
       'The features of the game are cool.. i like all the pvp dungeons.. but most of the dungeons with event goes in certain time and limited.. if i miss them..then i hardly get the purpose of installing this game meaning.. nothing else to do.. it\'s getting boring for player like me who wants to spend hours online but no more rewarding pvp dungeons available overnight.. maybe create some entertaining 24 hours pvp features? I can tell many players tend to be inactive for more than 1 day...so hope for more crowded and better LOD..',
       'I just realized this evening that this game uses the microphone feature to spy on the players and listen to their conversations without their consent. After joining one event I could clearly hear conversations of other players (not about game and I\'m sure without them even knowing that they were being listened to) while I was having my sound turned off, even after leaving that particular event and when having my game in the background the sounds didn\'t stop until I turned off the game. This game should be called Legacy of Spies, nice try 👍🏻',
       'Spent almost two months time in this game but end up their glitch after an update resulted certain claim item forfeit. Maybe I was an f2p hence not worth their time and effort to assist me. Game deleted.',

      'Controls are terrible. Doesn\'t feel natural at all. Have to pay for every park/spot other than the starter park which sucks. Just pay the $1.99 for True Skate. Way better game with more natural feel for the controls and bigger parks/bettter spots. It\'s like going from Tony Hawk Pro Skater to EA\'s Skate series. Give us at least better controls to make this feel better. Fluck it. Not pick up finger to ollie which doesnt even work %80 of the time.',
       'Would be better if you could Manuel between tricks  and if the tricks were in combo with other instead of individually named. Also can\'t seem to feeble, or smith grind:/ Fakie seems to not be working for me, it just registers at regular even though I\'m clearly riding fakie! Also I\'ve paid for this game and haven\'t seen a new park in the past year and the map The Docks sucks!!',
       'Spent literally hundreds of hours playing this when I had an iPhone, it was the best mobile game of all time.. Then I switched to android, and waited forever for it to be ported to android. I was so happy when I found out it had eventually made it\'s way to the play store, downloaded it immediately and bought all of the parks. Then I realised it didn\'t have the option to replay clips or edit them like the iPhone version does. This has ruined the game.. One of the best features was the ability to watch back a line you have spent hours perfecting, edit the clip and share it. PLEASE judt add the ability to replay and edit clips on android like you can do on iPhone and make it the greatest game of all time again.',
       'It\'s an amazing game! I also have a suggestion. For tricks, like the ollie and kickflip, it should matter where your feet (Fingers) are, so if your going for a kickflip, you should have your foot higher up on the board and for doubles and triples, your foot should be farther down. I know it\'s quite large and some people may not like it, but it would add more realistic gameplay.  Edit: Also some different trucks would be nice, and also if it had grind marks.  Also you should add user challenges and maps, I know this would be a huge update to make but I know it would make the game so much better.',
       'Needs some fixes. It\'s EXTREMELY annoying when I go to do a nose or tail slide, the game does a boardalide. Even if I\'m blatantly placing my fingers in the right spots on the screen. How do I unlock "Skate". Needs more designs. Better customization.  Also needs to recognize more tricks.  Along with already existing ones to be better portrayed. Should add a mode where the board is essentially floating. So that one may be able to flip the board without wipe out to see how to do a specific trick. Game is fun though.',
       'Awesome game it\'s so fun and like real life skating I use to play this game along time ago when It had the horrible camera angle and it has improved a lot. It\'s not hard to control either. The one thing I didn\'t like was that there is no replay! If you could replay truck it would be perfect' ,

      'I love it! I play every night for 5-10 minutes, it is perfect for an evening entertainment! the only annoying thing about this game is that some of the questions repeat too often (in a different form, but still the same question). But in general, game is great.',
       'Great layout and design. Was very easy at first then got harder. At level 40 and the questions are getting way too obscure. Shouldnt they be about things most people have a general knowledge of at least. How is anyone above level 500? You are either cheating or have absolutely no life...',
       'I just keep going back for more! Fun, challenging and I\'ve learned a great deal. It\'s so hard to get shut out on that 10th question. I\'ve done a mental tally of how many questions I\'ve answered for zero reward....ouch! I\'m in agreement with others grumbling about this but, in fairness, it adds to the tension that makes me try harder!',
       'What element was present during the big bang? I didn\'t know the big bang "theory" has been accepted as fact or that someone was there to know what elements were present.  On a positive note this game is a lot of fun. Nice format and the ads arent too intrusive.',

      'The game works fine during the day, then somewhere around 7pm NZT, the game locks itself and I can\'t play for 12 hours. Has been this way for a long time.  Also I\'m the new update it asked if I wanted to reload an old profile and I\'ve lost all the galactic and colossal cards I\'ve earned. Any chance I can get my old account back?',
       'Please fix ur connectivity!!! Why i sometimes disconnected from rank matches even though my line is strong? This is annoying when i could win the battle but u guys made me lose by saying my connection has problem😡',
       'Thank you so much ELECTRONIC ARTS for this amazing game. I know you guys worked really hard on this game and I would like to say that this is my favourite game. But I just want you to change one thing back please. Please can you make this game so I\'m able to play without data and Wi-Fi. Please can you guys do this for me.',
       'Most amazing, addictive awesome game . Unpredictable and challenging and rewarding .    The last update/patch didn\'t fix on my phone . The season restarted, I got my rewards for last season, and started again at level 30. Then the next time I signed in I was back at my previous level of Ultimate, I could tell the game went back to the old game . Is this going to be fixed ..?? I\'m still playing last season\'s level',
       'Please nerf captain cucumber, as a zombie main it\'s too problematic to fight against that card, for example unlike a similar card imp commander which in order to draw a card they have to deplete the enemy\'s health, whereas captain cucumber can just get a new card for just doing damage! Aside from that the cost of using it is too little, if the plant player has a trick then the earliest they can play it would already be turn 4!',
       'This is an amazing game but it\'s starting to upset me. I\'ve been playing battles in pvp and for 10 times in a row right before I would win the battle it will say on my end that I lost internet connection. At first I figure maybe that I was losing connection until it happened 10 times in a row. Can you please fix or give me back my stars I lost or something please.' ,

      'This slot game is designed to suck money out of a player in order to play for long periods of time. The payouts stink! Also no real way to exit the game or to close the app out!',
       'Started out really good. Lots of games, l I talked of payouts but after a little gaming it went south! Ain\'t that normal though, couldn\'t hit to save my a$$',
       'Love this game. I have gotten 3 different fines and I\'ve downloaded the game on each one. Only thing I hate is that I loose my credits when I came phones. But in no time I\'m able to get back up',
       'Totally over the requests for Facebook postings. There are a lot of us who dislike Facebook.. so why promote such a site??? As for the game, well the ads are over the top.  Payouts are excellent though.  Cut back on all the annoying features and this game would be truly awesome.  Never any need to spend as when the chips run out, as long as you regulary backup to your email addy.. just reset to last save.  Pays to clean out the cache on a regular basis, to keep your Tablet or Phone running at peak contition.',
       'Cool slot game, only wish that the game devs would change the game stats to be a little easier to win when your chips are getting low, so that ur able to keep playing for awhile, instead of waiting 4hrs for a new login bonus wheel...4hrs is a little rough..2-3hrs yeah not 4!!!',
       'This is my favorite of all video slots that I play. Mind blowing payouts! I now play only  the SUPER LUCKY CASINO apps (SLC).       You never have to spend any money to be a club participant (free to be in a club, free to leave and able to create your own club).      The easiest way to review all of the SUPER LUCKY CASINO apps exclusively,, is to key Super Lucky Casino into the google play search.      I enjoy being in a club that competes in a league. You can win millions of chips depending on your level of play. There are multiple ways for getting chips which include given and paid. Naturally, winning them can be the most fun and exciting ways.       The payouts are remarkable and consistant. I have pulled down 1.7 billion chips in a bonus cycle on a 5 million dollar bet. I have experienced several wins like that in different games in this SLC app and one other.      If you are in a club, one way to advance or hold your position is to play in the events.     The only thing that bugs me is that even after buying into any of the SUPER LUCKY CASINOS, it still costs 4.99 plus tax to be able to control advertisements and commercials (only then can you turn on or off ads). However, if you are in league play, there will be those times when I want to see those ads because there have been opportunities provided through those advisements that I want to know about. The plus side of buying into this is the abilitty turn back on the ads when you want and then back off. Try each of the SUPER LUCKY CASINO APPS, each has its charm.' ,

      'I gave it 5 star coz it is the best game on Android.  But the some thing need to change or put it the up coming updates.  Like make hardcore game mode to the unskilled and fair place to play with normal guns and normal armors or not with armor just regular health. I m sure you got the point and will make it better. Still love it thank for the best game',
       'Great game. Good job devs. Unlike what some people are saying, that this is p2w. I don\'t think that\'s correct.  I\'m a free to play gamer, and I\'m doing pretty good. You just need to find the propper weapon for yourself(not nessesarily the most expensive one) and the game mode you are most accustomed to. A few improvements could be done though,  like add a few bigger maps. Also please add vehicles like your other game WWheroes. That would be awesome. Also maybe a feature to play with your friends on LAN. Great concept,gameplay,controls,graphics. Thanks guys.....',
       'This is one of the best fps. I tell people who ask me about this game game, its like a call of duty for your phone. I\'ve never really liked to many phone game but just end up dealing with them. I can honestly say I really enjoy this game. The only down fall is it can get expensive and that\'s why I would say 4/5. Money part set a side 5/5 great game.       Thank you for making this game',
       'READ READ READ This stings... i literally played all day and night. Went from level 5 to 18.. and just as i went on a spending spree of golden chests.. a hacker has put a big button over the equipment screen... cant buy anything.. and like 10 legendary rented guns gone to waste.. were is ur contact us button so i can send photos. Update cant enter battles either.',
       'Over all this game is really good and has high quality graphics compared to other games. The only problem with it is how much gold is required to put attachments on guns. People who play this game that aren\'t going to pay to win are going to leave the game if they can\'t get their hands on a good fun and a good leveled up armor piece .',
       'Game is super unfair and a huge rip-off, it\'s loaded with hackers who can shoot through walls and the cost of upgrading weapons is insane. Most of the time they spawn you right on top of another player so you get smoked before you even materialize. Don\'t waste your time of money.' ,

      'I play the game all the time, but it needs easier and faster prestige. Three days of waiting for the next egg is bs with a prestige score of almost 1,000,000. Also "silos" hardly earn anything. That\'s my main complaint. Fix it so they earn WAY more over non play or I\'m done and I\'ve actually spent money so if you still want that, fix it.',
       'Fun and simple game that lets you gradually grow your farm at your own speed. This is a game you can play from once a week where you collect the money you\'ve collected offline, buy upgrades, then leave the game for another week; to spending a few casual hours of hunting for the drones that give you extra money and gold eggs which are the games micro-transaction currency to buy permanent upgrades that help your farm grow faster. It not so much a race as it is just enjoying your farm steadily grow over time.',
       'Edit: Latest update is thoroughly average. Some great new tools and really cool upgrades mixed in with ridiculously boring time sink achievements. They breathed new life into the game and then stuffed it up and made me sit around for 20 actual real life days for each egg waiting for a chicken counter to reach a billion. Such a shame.  I like big numbers and Egg Inc. delivers in spades. Click and hold functionality, strategic planning and approachable mission targets; one of the best in the genre.',
       'My only complaint is when is that everything you tap opens a menu. So if you were to try to hit a drone and accidentally tap the housing it opens that menu and you can\'t close it fast enough to still get the drone. I think there should just be a single or couple small menu buttons that allow you to cycle through the different things you can purchase to avoid this. Other than that great game! It\'s entertaining to have 100 million chickens in your pocket.',
       'Been playing this game for a while now, but something awesome happened. I completed a quest which took about 4 days to manage, but I only completed it about an hour before the deadline. It didn\'t register, and when I looked it said I haven\'t completed the quest and it\'s expired. Today I got a popup saying sorry about that, and giving me the rewards for it, so thanks!! What a game and what great developers you are!',
       'The graphic are great and the gameplay is fun but what kept me going was the writing. At first I was like uhhh another newspaper? Those don\'t do anything... But I kept reading and they are GREAT. On the lower side, the drones often clip in building and can\'t be clicked or you click straight on it but get sent to a building screen instead and by the time you get back, the fast drones are gone.' ,

      'It\'s gonna be better if you can do any useful upgrades or some useful items to help with flights. And do come out with a solution regarding zooming out and in. The missiles sometimes come out of the side of the screen too suddenly and we can\'t see and react to them. Maybe the screen should be zoomed to the part where the players can react to the missiles from side screen. Other than that, nice game.',
       'The game concept is amazing and the motion of play is good too. However its as if the creators are trying on purpose to make this game a flop. The controls are absolutly rubbish and honestly make no sense. The plane makes unwanted sudden turns. This coulb be simply avoided and simplified by a joystick control.i shall review my rating once the game gets an update improving the controls',
       'Ok so, I really enjoyed this game so I decided to pay in order to remove the ads... Turns out the ads are still poping up and of course there is no way I can contact them about this issue. Just a bunch of thieves.',
       'I played a few rounds, decided it was a great time killer but it has too many ads. Paid for no ads, still have ads. Update: emailed the developer, have not recived an answer, and STILL have ads. Next is an email to Google play, if they don\'t do anything I\'ll be contesting the charge with my bank.',
       'It\'s just a constructive criticism. Now to be honest. I Uninstalled it within 10 minutes.  I know you need to earn money but you know greed is bad ALWAYS.  Too much ads every single time.  And touch controls also lil weak. Just so annoying.  Better luck next time.',
       'u will see more ads than u actually get to play the game. Garbage, waste if time. One of the ads actually made my phone crash. Save ur time and don\'t download trust me' ,

      'Amazing addictive game. Try it out! Not too many ads, and just the right amount of challenge without pulling your hair out. Sometimes there\'s a hidden dot in the title, or ones that are almost the same color as the background, but it\'s not bad enough to lose a star.',
       'Updated with no fix...  problem still persists.  No exit button and controls for the back button are very wonky. Need to add dedicated exit button or fix what happens when you tap / swipe the blank park of the screen. Trying to bring the controls up from their hidden state selects options is frustrating. You end up starting games. Very unpolished controls, imo.',
       'Cool game, only bad thing is that tutorial levels are rated as bronze so you can never have all gold.. I tried doing the same tutorial three times in a row, then it is counted as gold, but when you exit the game and enter again that it is bronze again',
       'Different and fun. Not too hard but still challenging.  Daily challenges are impossible to complete though (bug?) , so don\'t bother with them (hence my only giving 3 stars)',
       'This right here is a work of genius.  My only wish is for an undo button, for when you accidentally touch a part of the screen and it places a spot/cut/bridge in an unwinnable spot.  Especially annoying during daily challenge that you can\'t re-do.  Also, I would like to be able to retry any level, such as the daily or randoms, even if it wouldn\'t "count". I\'m convinced every so often there is an unwinable level, but you can\'t even test it or let the devs know because once you fail it goes away permanently.  Still, a great, great game... I really hope there is a V2 some day.',
       'Really fun and intuitive. Wish there were some kind of bonus challenge though, right now you can only win or lose, but not win with style!' ,

      'The story lines are great, and a definite change from Choices. Where the game loses points for me is in the ticket generation. When similar games give you at least two tickets/keys to play a chapter, it makes no sense that you only get one ticket for this game per play. The creators should reconsider that, and at least offer players two tickets. When that changes I\'ll up my star rating.',
       'Its jst da best one i hav evr played.. truly romantic .. thrilling.. what else i m totally in luv wid evry charactr.. only complaint will b smetmes da decision i wanna choose r to expensive.. cn u mak diamonds at choose frm 25 to 10 or 15..?',
       'At first i didn\'t like it because you had to wait 40 minutes to get another ticket, and you only got 1 ticket, but after i payed money for the unlimited for 7 days i blew through book after book. Love the game',
       'So good I had to buy unlimited passes... Only wish they\'d let you think about a choice instead of clicking to the next page right away... I accidentally screwed up and wasted 25 gems like that...',
       'Good stories, but you don\'t really get to choose your path and the chapters are really short. Another downside is after each chapter you have to wait an hour for another ticket before you can carry on unless you pay. To change clothes you need quite a lot of gems and it shuts down   alot (bugs). Its a shame as could be better with improvements.',
       'Great stories and definitely addicting.  Dislike that you have to wait an hour for a ticket as most games give you 2. Also, I\'ve noticed a glitch in the option to "speed up" the timer if you watch a short video. I\'m given that option some days but not others. I\'ve sent a message to their support group over 2 days ago and never heard back' ,

      'This game is ingenious and amazing, and the script is beautiful and gameplay is simple and straightforward, timeless, and fun, with increasing difficulty, but also, able to go back and compete against yourself for more Rewards. The user interface is spot-on, and the graphics are perfect. They scale well to any resolution and any aspect ratio, taking up the entire screen without any letterboxing. The actual gameplay is simply a 2 button gameplay, left and right, and yet, this game kept me busy for hours. It\'s addicting, but doesn\'t require you to consistently visit the app. It does not nag you in any way.  I have not seen a single advertisement, and the developer does not have any big paywall or reward system for paying. You will not need to spend any money on this.',
       'I think it is a good idea done well. I havent had any problems so far and the game os more than i expected. I thought the game would just be full of mindless levels but it is not. It even has a cool story and i cant wait to see how it plays out. There ia a cool mechanic wherd you get a speed boost the closer you are to the walls. I really enjoyed the game and i think it deserves 5 stars. This is the only mobile game i loved so much i actually made a review for.',
       'This is the best game ever, that I have ever played 1. I loved the story (You will know what I mean when you have played) 2. The controls are very strange and frustrate some people. But I think that\'s what make the game challenging 3. THE MUSIC. I loved the choices they have made with the music. It\'s really good love it 4. The graphics are really good couldn\'t ask for more 5. Really like the secrets   PS. Would like if you could at some kind of multiplayer when you have beaten the game  - Love Ln\'TCore',
       'Saw this before and saw 4.9 out of 5 with over 80,000 reviews. That\'s... unheard of on the store. So I came back to try it out. Completely worth it. Gameplay is flawless, visuals are gorgeously retro and vaporwave, the soundtrack is all retrowave from various artists, and the story is really good too. It\'s not often I rate games, and even then I\'m not excited when writing them. For this one I can\'t praise this game enough. Perfect retro-styled racing gem on Google Play.',
       'I don\'t often play games and I never review them. But this game absolutely merits five stars.       The writing is stunningly brilliant, kind of like if Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance was made into an arcade game.  A very simple and somehow-complex 1980s arcade game.  With lots of fun and poignant nerdy jokes, and all female characters.      The story is full of mystery and human intrigue, and somehow also a nihilistic treatise on technology and how it functions in our life. And I sincerely apologize if that ruins any surprise for anyone still reading this review.',
       'This game... This game is outstanding. It was a fun challenge. The story is short, but extremely sweet. The lore in the background is engaging, I constantly wanted to hear more. The absolute lack of microtransactions has me in awe - this game was legitimately made in order to entertain, not make money off of you. I really want to replay it again, and again, and again. The developers have created something here, something that will hopefully drive other developers to create works of art on a similar level. The game is really short, only 2 hours of story, and then an extra two hours to finish all the extra challenges. If you have a free time slot, why not allot it to this game?' ,

      'The graphics aren\'t the best and the set up isn\'t totally comprehensive. Some maps are so zoomed in that it\'s hard to recognize the general location unless you\'re already really familiar with geography. It could be more interesting, but the questions are good and it has helped me learn some.',
       'I\'m extremely impressed by your app. It is not only fun, but it is the best educational app that has taught me so much! The border outline is the only thing that needs better graphics...otherwise I couldn\'t be happier!!! (An offline mode would make this app perfect) . Thank you!🙋💯💡👍❗🌠🏆💝☺',
       'Was a great game, I learned a ton of geography. But now the ads are seriously out of control. Top players are really the ones who watch the most ads. Also, it would be nice if the encyclopedia allowed you to compare countries for a given category instead of only being able to view a single country.',
       'The graphics/fonts and everything are outdated, but there is SO much information you can be quizzed on. I\'m learning everyday!',
       'Good game, but could someone help me? I don\'t know where to ask anywhere else. I\'m a level 32 and I have changed my phone. Now it asks for my user ID, which apparently isn\'t the same as my user name, which I know. Where could I retrieve it? I\'d hate to start over.',
       'It is challenging and does exercise the brain! I do find the format a bit confusing and the categories misleading (e.g. questions about Africa under "Americas" (?) But fun overall.' ,

      'I love Beat the Boss 4! But there are some things that I would like to be fixed. For example, when naming your custom boss, the name duplicates. The way to fix it is by putting spaces after it. Another example is that the boss customization screen sometimes switches back to boss selection screen and can\'t go back after being there for long periods of time. I would love to give this game 5 stars if these issues were fixed.',
       'Game is now unplayable due to ads and KIIP rewards popups. The ads bring up my status bar so I can\'t X out of the ad, and the app hangs when trying to load the KIIP program. I have no interest in trying to play something that shovels ads in your face more often than you can actually play.',
       'I loved it. I understand the ads are so that you can continue your work. However, there is a few probelms. First of all, when you click on the judgey/uneven eyes, they change to even eyes. Second of all, when you click on a custom character, the game doubles the name, and following along with that, sometimes it undoes it. I understand if it takes a long time, but i\'m asking you, if you can, to please fix these when you can. Sorry for bothering you.      Doge is waiting',
       'Too many ads. It\'s annoying especially when you are connected to the internet. The King Boss is not working and is always saying "Something went wrong, please try again later" and crashes the whole gane. On the other hand it\'s a super addictive and fun game to play.',
       'This game needs a lot of work done. So many glitches its really weird and hard to explain the glitches that happen. One of them was the screen uncalibrated itself an it was moved to the upper left side , an the right side was just black . idek if that makes sense but it shouldn\'t happen.',
       'The game is amazing, but it is pathetic at the fact that there are ads popping up every 2 minutes and there\'s no way to remove them... I would be happy to pay to remove the ads, I won\'t be playing this game until this is fixed. I remember playing this game years ago, I understand you guys may be making more money from displaying ads than people paying to remove them.' ,

      'I really do enjoy playing this game. It\'s a great time waster. Good for breaks at work. Public transit. Bored at home. Good graphics. You can choose the controls method. Great car selection. I enjoy it so much, to help the creator I spend a few bucks now and then. It\'s one of the few games I actually play. Just wish there was actual racing. Or if you could have police chasing you, rather than being the police. Either way, good game. Those would be great to implement. 😁',
       'THIS GAME IS OVERPOWERD I\'ve been finding a game that is  A Leagend Car game. Then i found this cool game and  I PLAYED IT ALOT. But not forever.   🎵THE STORY🎵  When i\'ve played it i saw a !alarm At the gifts then i liked you at facebook Then i subscribed you on youtube  And i liked you at twitter too. Then theres a free luckybucy thing. The free watch and then you will have $500.THANK YOU FOR THE GAME',
       'This game is getting boring. Yah, Next Generation Endless Racing blahblah. But is this all about endless whatever? I think you must put some thrill to this game. This is nothing compared to Traffic Rider which is you also create that game (Yeah. Traffic Rider is one of my fav game.) I HOPE YOU PUT SOMETHING THRILLING LIKE MISSIONS *NOT DAILY MISSION* AND PUT SOME CAR NAMES IN IT. ONE MORE HOPE YOU MAKE THE CARS IN TRAFFIC MORE REALISTIC IT LOOKS LIKE A MOVING BOX... AND I WANT SOME FEEDBACK.',
       'Hello, 😊 I really love this game, my favourite actually! I have play a lot of games, but this one is the best so far! PS.:I never spent real money on games! But in this game you don\'t really have to, so it\'s even better for me and for people who can\'t spend real money in virtual things. I know that there are 1 or 2 cars in the game that you can only buy with real money, but it still is a perfect game in my opinion! 😉',
       'I\'ve been playing this game for a long time on a couple devices and it\'s been a lot of fun. There seems to be some variations in scale of one compact car to another. The models themselves don\'t quite seem to be in scale to each other. You might have two hatch backs that should both be small, even very near in size but when you\'re looking at cars to buy you can tell that the model itself just isn\'t quite the right size compared to other similar cars, and then when you get out on the road with it, it looks bigger than it should compared to other vehicles on the road around it. But.. That\'s not too big of a deal. Great game!',
       'Fun, decent selection of vehicles, graphics and controls look and  work great. But theres a car with no way to get it but paying 15 actual dollars and I hate that. Everything should be earnable even if basically impossible to earn and $15 is alot of money for a single vehicle in a small limited android game. Even the dlc cars in major games like gran turismo and forza are cheaper and those games are way better. That aspect of the game is just confusing is all. Still fun to play.' ,

Me:Ooooh.....is see. Then i come home rest for little bit and seacrh this Game.     THE   END',
       'I paid $4.99 and still haven\'t got my gems either give me my gems or I will charge back my money. The game is good but I\'m pissed I haven\'t got what I paid for.   EDIT:  It\'s been almost 3 whole days since I paid this app for gems in-game and they have yet to give them to me, I have made a successful charge back for my money by calling Google play. Do not download this app and do not make any in-game purchases from this app. Just pay the $6.00 to play Minecraft.',
       'Great game (very similar to Minecraft) until you get bored of stuff to do due to no red stone and limited items to build. Plus, mine kept freezing and logging off but when I\'d log back in, all my stuff would magically disappear! Complete waste of my time! Deleted after the 3rd time it happened and it was on multiple devices so I know the issue wasn\'t on my end! Also, you get bombarded with advertisements whenever you sleep, switch inbetween menus and craft items!',
       'CandaDroid yesterday I used 5.00 for a gem pack and never got any gems if possible could you give the gems owed cause currently I have yet to see any number change in gems or if you can\'t get the gems could I receive a refund and as proof I payed for it I\'ll email you a copy. The whole situation makes me upset again if possible could I get the gems or at the very most a refund, please and thanks Rhapsodic Archer',
       'Probably the worst game I\'ve ever attempted to play. Tutorial is just shy of non-existent. That means it doesn\'t tell you anything. navigation gave me such vetigo I\'m about to throw up and that\'s not an exaggeration. yeah, i would give it 0 stars if possible. you guys really need to send this one back to creator and fire him/her.',
       'The engine seems good but I have no idea what you\'re meant to do. It just seems like a sandbox. I walked round for ten minutes collecting flowers and trees and managed to make a few sticks and blocks but wasn\'t sure how to make anything with them. The tutorial is pants.' ,

      'I love this game. I truly do. That\'s why this hurts. With the Adam Warlock update, I knew I had to be ready to save up crystals, though I did intend to spend a few for new uniforms, but hiding the one for the update\'s protagonist behind 5.5k crystals is a new low, and you haven\'t even soothed the slap on our faces from the Ultimates\' update. I was prepared to buy a new subscription for crystals or bios, but not anymore.  Netmarble, I thought you better than this. You had a good, committed following, yet you abuse us like this.',
       'An amazingly, beautiful made Game, which is a true gem for Marvel fans. Hats off to you guys. I didn\'t thought that android platform will be that big in gaming areas. I am a Hardcore gamer and i know what gaming should look like...and that\'s what it looks like - Future Fight. I hope you guys will improve the game from time-to-time so that we can\'t get bored of it.',
       'Updates? Updating means improving something, you\'re just digging a bigger hole NM.. I used to spend £10 a month on this, now it\'s not even enough to unlock the new characters... Many of my free to play friends stopped playing, and I\'m 1 update of following them.. Just can\'t be bothered with the grind, and the other option is pumping money into it. That\'s not gonna happen anymore.',
       'Do not even download this game. It is an absolute scam. At one point it was a good game but you will quickly find all the good characters are locked behind thousands of dollars of paywall. Much of the game is based on RNG and so a lot of the resources you can actually grind for go up in smoke. If you don\'t already have this, stay away.',
       'This game is fun and a great phone game. If you are looking for a game with leveling that will occupy time and love comic books this is the best. It has been plagued the last few updates with customer relation problems due to what has been viewed as cash grab maneuvers. The developers need to go back to what was making the game successful. The increasing of prices every few updates will destroy consumer confidence. I do feel that they listen to their customers and make adjustments accordingly.',
       'Look I downloaded this game not too long after installation I expect to play the game then I was notified that I can\'t play offline no problem with that but my problem was downloading the update info which also cost 522.36 mb. All this should not b necessary I think it should be like this when downloading the game there should be an additional file which should be the update info.I feel it will be easy for those who are downloading this game (like me) to start the game instead of downloading "update info" before starting the game. And I hope make u of this advice because it will be beneficial for those who are downloading the game and for you.' ,

      'Too many Ads. I realize there\'s a purchase option for no ads, I don\'t want to spend money a centuries old game. The ads are distracting and the reason I\'m opting for another. There will always be another app without ads, so I don\'t know why you have to be a capitalist douche and force payment.',
       'Well done. Love this app. Lots of options in the settings which greatly enhances its flexibility. AI is challenging but not impossible to beat. Lots of levels therefore can gradually crank up the difficulty as you get better. Only thing missing is a 3-D option unless I\'ve somehow missed it in the settings.',
       'Too much annoying ads! The game as great before the update few days ago. The ads now auto play and cannot go back to the game as by pressing back button during the ads like before. The ads play itself and ut off my music playback every time and the game did not make the playback continue after the ads. It\'s so annoying Everytime you finish the game the ad pops up and play its video then cut off your music and you have to press play on your music app again and again. If you put the ads to get money that\'s fine but PLEASE mute them so the ads won\'t cut off the playback music that I am listening or if you let the ads auto play please make the game playback the music after the ads. I will not rate 5 stars till this issue has been fixed.',
       'One of the best graphics available (simple and classy), but the amount of adds became ridiculous. Algorithm for levels is not working properly (same levels vary too much). Also, it could improve tutor.',
       'Requires Google Play Services to have access to lots of unnecessary privacy related information for the Achievements to work. Unacceptable! Minus 1 star for that. It amazes how much personal information people are willing to hand over to play a "free" game. Great chess app otherwise.',
       'Best chess app. Don\'t think twice before trying it. I\'ve tried a dozen similar apps and found myself using this one for over 2 years across 4 devices.' ,
