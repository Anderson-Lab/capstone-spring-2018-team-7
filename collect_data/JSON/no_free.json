       'I love the game, it\'s very addicting and fun (sometimes a little frustrating). But could you add a "left-handed mode", where the knives you have left show on the right bottom of the screen? Because being left-handed makes it uncomfortable to play without covering how many knives I have left. I think that\'d be a minor but good addition to the game? Anyway, the game is still great, good job on it.',

      'In my humble opinion, this game is truly a work of art and talent. This game can be used by people of all skill levels, due to the variations of complexity and difficulty within each pixel art piece. And it\'s just bursting and overflowing with hundreds, maybe even thousands of art pieces. There are hours of fun and relaxation awaiting you, and what a way it is to pass the time. Even better, it is appropriate for ages of all kind, including small children.Overall, I recommend this to anyone willing, for this is truly glorious.',
       'I love this game! There are so many pictures to color! This game will keep me occupied for hours! I just love how creative they are! But one question...Why do more pictures come by and take the place of my new colored ones? Like, why do more pictures come by everyday? It\'s kind of frustrating to color the new ones and then more appear the next day. Please fix, or stop the glitch. Overall, great game.‚ò∫',
       'Awesome app, its oddly satisfying and can either be really challenging ir really easy. Its constantly update with new pictures to do, and already contains probably hundreds lol, if dont 75+ and in saving the really detailed ones for last. If there even is such a thing. But, i think a counter for how many blocks of each color are left would be a really awesome alteration. There are many strategies to use when you do a color by number. So a counter for how many blocks of the selected number are left, it would be such a life save.this game has taken enough of my life already as is lmao',
       'Way to many ads, was hard to enjoy. Would have been more bearable If the ads weren\'t 30 seconds each, and played everytime I open/close a drawing. And, to prevent any ads you have to pay. I just want an easy, accessible, relaxing game. And by either making one pay, or making them suffer is not really my idea of "Relaxing". Thank you for your consideration.',
       'Good but ¬£4 is a lot to not quite remove all the add. Some pictures are still locked behind and walls. Easy enough to unlock but for the price id expected all add to be removed. Also really would like the pictures to be sortable by category with more fantasy and space stuff in the complex pictures. Also there appears to be no way to sync pictures across devices. If I\'ve paid ¬£4 I should be able to switch between the phone and tablet at will. Both are android.',
       'This game is really fun and when u play it u won\'t even know how fast the time has gone by. This game has some really challenging photos to colour which I am still working on. The thing that is not really good about this game is that there are lots of adds that pop up every time. Please improve that. Other than that this game is fantastic and I also really love all of the images we need to colour and how there are different modes u can change image after u have completely coloured it. I would definitely recommend this app.' ,

      'So far so good.  I\'m only on level 12 right now and this fantastic. Kids will feel good about themselves. I\'m hoping that it stays simple for a while longer. Kids tend to have shorter attention spans than adults and get frustrated easier. All in all a great game thus far. Thanks',
       'I absolutely love this game. The graphics are spectacular. The characters well they\'re not characters their cartoons they\'re amazing. And the game is fun. My only complaint is that every level is a struggle to get through and it would be nice if occasionally they would make a few of them easier.',
       'You will not believe what I am about you tell you but this game picks and chooses who to charge for rewards. I have screenshots of my partner\'s game, not having to pay for his rewards and I look at my game, getting charged $2.99 everytime I want my rewards. Its messed up and I have deleted the game.',
       'Support don\'t want to help when you have an issue. Once they reply you don\'t have an option to reply to them, you have to start all over again and it\'s the same reply about back up to Facebook etc, which I did.... level 170 and I had to start again, don\'t ask for help, they don\'t care!!! Better of with candy crush or another competitor game',
       'Toy Blast for Kids, much easier and a more basic playing structure. In play while waiting for my Toy Blast lives to refill. BUT now it keeps telling me there is a problem with my game history when I open it and it deletes all my lives, damn annoying',
       'Fun and love the opportunity to get free helpers to beat harder levels when needed. Only bad part is piggy bank that you have to spend money to use it.' ,

       'So. Who wants a GOOD, fun, entertaining game that you can\'t stop playing? You? OK then. This is the game for you. You can win coins for dying, reviving, and playing every day. It\'s easy. My 3 year old brother can play it, but there\'s 1 thing you need to remember if you are younger than 8. DO NOT START KILLING SAUSAGES IN MUMS OR DAD\'S KITCHEN. THERE WOULD BE EXTREME CONSEQUENCES INCLUDING THE HOSPITAL... Have fun!',
       'There is some fun to be had here, if you enjoy constant adds and having some no-win obstacles come your way. I mean really what\'s the point of a game where randomly nothing you do matters and you will die? If they changed it to where what you did had an impact on you dieing or not (at all times not just some of the time) it would be worth playing. Uninstalled.',
       'Complete garbage. The whole game revolves around watching ads. You spend more time watching long ads than playing the game. The game itself is a Temple Run ripoff with 1-tap control. Mind-numbingly boring and the microtransactions is front and center. This game has everything that\'s terrible with mobile gaming.',
       'Love it! Definitely addicted to collecting all the outfits. Although please make it so you can pay coins to revive yourself. I dont like ads which is why i paid for the ad free version. Also it should be like 10 coins 1st revive 25 next 50 next 100 etc...',
       'I LOVE THIS GAME! It\'s so fun. I encourage other\'s to play this game. Though, the commercials are kind of annoying and weird. But over all good game. I\'m so edicteted to all of the different sausages you can be! If you hate this game, You Are Weird. There\'s a point to this game. All of my friends are like there\'s no point. And BLA BLA BLA! I love this game! üòáüòÄüòÑüòõüòãüòçüòé!' ,

      'The in app purchases are a little overboard. I normally wouldn\'t pay for stuff in an app but for this game I would definitely not even consider it. Nothing should cost more than $50, but there are packages in this app costing $100... that\'s way too much and I really don\'t like it. The only thing I want to see in the game is the ability to upgrade things with a percent amount of money. (10%, 25%, 50%, 75%, and obviously max which already exists)',
       'It was a fun time waster while it lasted. I had the game for about 3 days and it just wouldn\'t load anymore. I tried uninstalling and re-instlling but the load screen gets stuck in the same spot. I\'ve uninstalled the app but again, fun while it lasted.',
       'Good game, nice time waster. Got the latest update and now the game will not load past 42%. I missed put on the last day of a special event due to this issue.',
       'Very fun for me to play, but honestly it\'s a little too addictive. Especially when special mines come up to complete',
       'Love this game but The escalator on the amethyst mine is stuck?? halfway down. Getting no ice cash!! Very frustrating üò£üò£',

      'Its overall a great game. I like the tracks and the cars. I just wished you could re-earn money by replaying tracks, but put it at half amount that way it gives people that dont want to spend money on the game a chance on singleplayer.  FIX THE LAG because you finish in first and you end up getting second, third or fourth because of the lag.',
       'A simple game that\'s like a modern version of an old school racing game I played. It\'s cool for the most part but it is lacking in the department of how to earn money. I wish your developers could add another way to get money than just multiplayer after you complete the career mode. It\'s also incredibly hard to find parts to cars you want without gems. This is mostly a pay to win game, I know but you already have a ton of ads so why make the game less enjoyable by having only two ways to make money? One is temporary and the other is permanent but you earn so little. I still enjoy the game but consider what I had to say, thank you.',
       'Finish race in 1st place. Waiting for rewards. Loading... Sudenly I\'m in 4th place and \'didn\'t finish the race\'. -40 trophies. Simply ridiculous  Also, fix the checkpoints. It\'s frustrating to get thrown back so much when all you did was get a little out of the track.',
       'Annoying adds. Draining my internet data i dont like it! Every challenges in multiplayer need to watch the adds so you will receive the reward nope that\'s horible. I prefer playing a free game so i don\'t like this kind of game. Its just simple thia is money game!!!',
       'I am at level 6 and on stage 2. I am noticing that the game is kinda lacking in car part drops. The level progress is fine, the amount that it costs to upgrade vehicles is fine, the fact that you can use gems to unlock cars is fine, but I am not seeing enough car part drops to keep the game from becoming stagnant.',
       'Thank you for fixing the chrashing :D It\'s a really fun game to play with friends during school or at home. I have 6 friends who play this and we are all having a lot of fun playing this. Hope we can get more cars and maps soon.' ,

      'I LOVE THIS GAMEE!! It\'s so addicting and once u get used to it, u can\'t stop playing it! It\'s a great time killer and it auto saves (not of u connected to Facebook.) Again, I love this game and I would recommend this game to EVERYONE because it\'s for all ages (unless u are a very serious person) JK LOL! :D',
       'OK, I love Idle clickers and this is a great game in this genre. Easy to get into, ads not forced on you, nice graphics.  There is one thing that is really bugging me though. You start out with your standard 9 crops and you can then unlock more for each plot. My issue is it does not tell you when you unlock a new one if it earns more than the standard one. Do they just look different but earn the same? Apart from this... Love it. Keep up good work devs',
       'AMAZING! I love this game. It is so addicting and a great way to pass time and boredom. I think though for one small improvement you could add a thing where there are like \'mini games\' and you earn coins for that. Using those coins earend in the mini games you spend it on things like watering cans, fences for live stock and more! This was only some suggestions for a bigger game if you can have or make a new game called like farm life or something like that....LOVE IT...',
       'Like so far But, 2 issues. 1- I don\'t Facebook or do any social media so needs to be a way other than ads for those bonuses. 2- daily rewards Don\'t happen. Shows that they were collected but will not activate unless I have enough diamonds. Please fix. Play offline on tablet and hotspot to get daily reward.',
       'Great and addicting game, but with one major bug. I went to collect my idle money and I watched a video too double it (46 billion total). But when I hit the button to collect it, I never got it. All the money dissapeared and I got nothing. What\'s the point of an idle game, if you don\'t get anything for being idle?',
       'I adored it at the start, very quickly got all 9 plots, but now I don\'t think I understand the point? I thought once I unlocked all 9, I would get a new plot, but instead I have to find (buy) shoeboxes to find new crops...and there doesn\'t seem to be a way of earning shoeboxes. I also completed one of the challenges (change the weather for 3 shoeboxes) but didn\'t get the reward! Very frustrating & O don\'t know what to do with it now other than uninstall it.' ,

      'Veeery enjoyable game! I feel like it\'s advertised too much, but it\'s definitely worth playing. Especially if you love games like Bejeweled!  Some of the levels are unnecessarily difficult to get by. You have to either get lucky, or be some type of strategic genius to pass them within a good time frame. That\'s slightly disappounting. Its too much of an encouragement to use money.',
       'I really like this Game so Far. I will play for awhile to See how it Works & If I like it. Absolutely Love Your Game. Play it ALL THE TIME!!! I Must Admit that I Really Do enjoy this Game! Sometimes I find myself Having a Hard Time With Certain Levels. I Could be On that Level for Days or a Few Weeks. I think with Some Improvement that Would make People Play. This Game More. But I Must Say Hat\'s Off to The Developers',
       'The reason why I love the game is bc its very addictive An it helps me concentrate. The only thing that I would like to suggest that we pull our friends in the game an work at these harder levels together so we can move forward to help Austin an his family members out. We still  need to be able to use our coins when we desire to not have to go through 2 boards on a game.',
       'It\'s catchy and addictive. Hooks you early. Enjoy the graphics, storyline and gameplay.  However as you get further into the game you pretty much have to spend money to advance. If you get an award, say an hour of free playing time, its rare to advance during that free time so it\'s a waste of an award.  On a smaller note there are not many decorating options. This is not a deal breaker for me however.',
       'I do not want to do the garden that is why there is a gardenescape game! I want to work on the house but too many task on the garden! What is the point of having a gardenescape version if the homescape is also aboyt the garden?! Spending too much time in one room or part of the house. Taking too long to advance into one level. Unnecessary requirements or decorations for the house. Exciting at first but too long to advance it becomes boring already',
       'I enjoy the game both for the mini games and the home decorating.  My only complaint is that I\'ve spent a lot of time in the yard and I prefer to stay in the house, but there is no choice as to what rooms unlock.  I hope the game goes back to the house soon.  If I wanted to do the yard who would be playing gardenscapes, or whatever the garden version of this game is.' ,

      'I love this game and would have rated it a 5 but suddenly the pause feature isn\'t working and I lost a game that was over 8000 points because I had a phone call. After I unpaused it set me back to zero. So aggravating. Also the 30 second ad for 30 stars doesn\'t show up anymore. Not sure what happened to this game in the last 2 weeks.',
       'This used to be an awesome game. I played it every day! But after the latest update, the ads at the top cause the game to lag terribly and make the ball fall very slowly and the pieces disappear slowly.  I can\'t adjust as needed due to the lag. I\'m unable to play due to this lag. Interestingly enough, when I turn on Airplane Mode thereby disabling the ads across the top, everything runs smoothly like it used to!! I am all for ads to support the developers  but this type they currently have causes severe lag which has rendered the game useless.',
       'I have paid ¬£2.99 to remove ads and in still getting them. I emailed the developer two weeks ago and have still not had a response. You are forced to watch ads so often the game becomes unplayable and paying the money to remove them does not work. Save your time and do not bother even installing it. If you do install it do not pay the money to remove ads as it does not work!!!',
       'There are way too many advertisements every time I start a game or lose or win a game I instantly get an 30 second ad which I have to waste my time on to skip it until I am finally done. Overall except for the advertisements it is a great game controls and game play is brilliant I recommend this game but you will get a lot of ads. Suggestion: Lower the amount of ads showen',
       'Its alright but theres too many ads. All adds are 30 secs and mostly unable to skip. I dont mind ads but the come up even when I\'m in the middle of a level, making it near impossible to do anything, so I\'m uninstalling it for that reason.',
       'Sadly, it could\'ve been a fun game if I could actually tap where I wanted to. The tap is off by like a few mm or something. I have to tap above the try again button to actually try again, or else I end up hitting challenges... So during the game play the exact same thing would happen, which makes the game unplayable.' ,

      'Gameplay design and illustration is perfect I think, cute character and easy to understand this game.  But ads and especially loading, it takes so long when we want to play this game, loading start screen, after ads also loading, after fame also loading, it\'s bit lazy to open this game bcos of long loading.  And last, so sad we cant play this offline or multiplayer maybe (such as visit friends buildings or make a business with any players.',
       'To many problems, but great idea behind the game. Twice now I\'ve had over 2000 fame stars but when I\'ve come back they are gone and I\'ve only got the 500+ stars I previously collect. No point playing when the game keeps loosing your saved games and you loose your fame points.',
       'I am writing a review for this game because of one problem from the settings menu. The settings menu that is on the top left corner of the screen where it gives you the option to turn off both music, sound and notification. I turned off the notification so I wouldn\'t be notified of anything coming from the game. The notification setting isn\'t doing well. I keep seeing a notification popup once in a while. Please fix this problem.',
       'Could have gotten 4-5 stars but the game CONSTANTLY keeps telling me I\'ve "lost connection", implying that I have no Internet, even though I very clearly do. Needs to be fixed as it happens very randomly, sometimes on startup, sometimes even in the middle of the game! Very annoying for someone who is just getting into it..',
       'Game requires internet connection non stop to play, thats absurd in this day and age. One star until you fix that glaring design FLAW!!! Also updating everytime that the game asks to rate.',
       'Not liking it. When u leave and come back it tell u that u can double the coins u made while gone if u watch a video but it doesn\'t add it. I am missing several trillion dollars. It just keeps the balance u had wen u left' ,

      'So I played it on my iPhone e and loved it. Recently o got a new phone and it\'s am android. I connected to my Nintendo account and loaded it up. My world seem to be it good shape everything there like in my IPhone but when I went to tour only world one was available. I\'m not going to spend another ten dollars to unlock what I already beat so please fix it I wanna keep enjoying this gamr',
       'I have had a very long conversation with someone at the hq and I was talking about the worlds. I bought the worlds on my iPad and downloaded Mario run on this device Android. I ask why my worlds that I purchased on my iPad aren\'t here. They don\'t connect that purchase with Nintendo account. When they connect everything else. I told them I am not paying twice so that brings down the rating for me for this game. But great fun and very enjoyable, but get the linking fixed. Seems a bit of a design flaw',
       'Like a big lugger spit in your eye if your a Mario fan. Iv played since the first Mario. For one I very very much hate how u can not control Mario really u just run forward very very annoying. I\'d be OK with this if not for the insane price they ask to move on after the 1st world! Highly disappointed in this. Make it like Mario or get rid of it personally',
       'Super Mario Run is a good game all tho you might get confused on some parts it helps you back out so thats good. The graphics great motion great then only thing i would like is if they could let us place the house or plant whatever and look at it before buying it other than that it\'s a great game to play',
       'It\'s not worth the $10 for the full game. The online versus mode is irritating at best. The controls are conveniently simple, but eventually become overly repetitive. The rewarding/punishment system for Toad Rally is a double-edged sword,  encouraging players to better themselves in order to compete, but also creates an environment where beginning or casual players may become discouraged from trying to compete amongst more adept players.',
       'Mediocre. Sometimes you can\'t perform well because you don\'t know where the multicolored coins are ahead of time. Also, the level design is not up to par for a standard mario game. I\'d suggest you save your money or if you do get it use the google rewards credits to purchase.' ,

      'Absolutely love all of the geometry dash games! Colors and graphics are awesome, game play is challenging but fun, and the music is perfect! Only thing I can complain about is that I wish all of the levels from these free versions were in the full version. I own the full version and would much prefer to be able to play these levels without ads and with all of the cool characters and colors I have unlocked. Other than that though, amazing work you guys, keep it up!',
       'Woah. WOAH. WWOOAAHH!!! Oh. Another Chllenging game but thhe only thing i like in it tha it has Dantdm\'s Old Intro at the press start! Wow. I am pro at Geometry Dash Games and another one oh yea and there is Sub Zero(MK) name there like i saw them quickly. And i would say for the creator: plz. Creator keep the good work! Ok!!! And make more Geometry Dash and can u make something more fun for more people to play with!!!',
       'Oh my god... This is the best geometry dash free game I have ever played,  and is almost more fun than the full version.  Robtop, you have regained full respect after what happened with meltdown. I\'m just speechless, at the amount of work that was put into these three levels, going from the camera angles to the animations. This game is not like meltdown,  which is three short amateur levels, but with three long, harder levels. This game is like a preview to 2.2, and I know it\'s going to be good.  We\'ll done, Robtop! Keep up the great work!',
       'This just blows my mind... one thing I would like to see in the future is some rob-top made tutorials on how each editing items works in the game so other players can feel more comfortable making their own levels and not be intimidated by all the other fan made levels... I am one of those players who is intimidated by the other fan made levels... This could help young and creative minds to create their own levels their friends can enjoy. Thanks 10/10',
       'I love this game so much.  Some of the effects and colours added into the game make it so fun to play and watch. Its challenging and thats what makes it fun. Its not like one of those games that are so easy you finish it in an hour. This game takes time and effort. Also the backround music is pretty cool. Especially nock em with headphones. controls are very easy to use, just tap to jump and usually hold to use the vehicles, so easy! This game is perfect and absolutely fun. I would highly recommend downloading geometry dash subzero.',
       'Don\'t get me wrong, these new levels and songs are fun and addictive and all of the new stuff is awesome... but stop making new apps? Why not just update the original? It\'s kind of frustrating to have a paid version with stuff I\'ve unlocked but have to deal with an unpaid version (aka, ads) and have to unlock skins and colors all over again because new apps keep being made.' ,

      'Really fun and challenging game nice music and graphics. There is one thing that would be cool if there was a fix for it. I like to listen to audio books when I play and it always turns it off. Is there a work around or fix you can do on that? It does it both on the Samsung 5 and 8 note phones. The music is fun to play with but when I\'m working through a board it\'s fun to play other content through my phone. Thanks.',
       'THIS GAME IS THE BAST!! Usually i dont download games but i saw the ad for this game many times so i just though oh why not. Now that im playing it its sooo awesome! Totally recommend it pplüòä',
       'I really want to love this game but I could barely play a little. I can\'t stand the controls. It\'s really bad. I\'m pretty sure it\'s fine on a phone but it\'s really inconvenient on a 7" device. I\'m disappointed there is no way to choose from other control schemes because the game itself looks fun!  Great visuals, nice music, lively, dynamic levels. Kinda like a 3D Geometry Dash.  I would definitely play it but it\'s so frustrating this way. Dying because of controls again and again...',

      'Great game, fun to play.  Only things I don\'t like are the fact there are so many ads and not just short ads long videos which is really annoying, and second and probable the biggest issue I found is that there is no single player option! I have to have like 10+ games going to enjoy playing if my partners arent online or play often. Would be much better if there was single player option',
       'Ads are too long and frequent but other than that, it\'s good.  It could do with more English stuff though. I have no idea what gym chains are in the U.S or discount stores or supermarkets for that matter but I do know England. Some rounds I can\'t take part in and end up losing the game because if it. Also, a lot of English synonyms aren\'t recognised either. I\'d enjoy the game even more if I could relate to all of it.',

       'This is an awesome game. A few suggestions though: Think it will be more fun if players play at the same time. Also why is fight list 2 not on the Play Store? I also think you should consider more international answers for questions that have a broader scope like  the one about Coca-Cola brands. All the ones available in my country were not recognized as answers. Great game !!!',
       'Update:  now the game won\'t let me start a new game.   Original post: Buggy to say the least. Paid to remove ads since it was only .99. And now the game randomly quits, and erases any games I\'ve started when I exit from the game for any period of time. Was find until I removed the ads. Great way to treat the people paying your bills.',
       'This game is very addicting and so fun to play. Some are challenging and can be hard if you don\'t spell the word correctly. I only wish we got 60 seconds. Some of the categories consist of longer words and some people can\'t type that fast. But I do love this game, just not an ad after every round.' ,

      'Unless you have 16 hrs a day to put into this game to learn the track you will never have a very high score. Sometimes your vehicle doesnt respond the same as other runs also you may land on your tail and survive and the next time you die its up and down with the control if you keep going or die. And sometimes it tries to flip when you try to take off resulting in a quick death',
       'Would and will give 5 star. But would like to see a gem counter. It gets rather tough keeping count.  Also I noticed sometimes that when come across the areas that have the 4-5 flat spiked walls that you have to time just right. When I die and revive they all seem to sync up together making it impossible to go under. I\'ll try and screenshot it next time. All in all great job and awesome game. Maybe a custom map feature for future. Possibly added to the no ads fee. Would be worth it then.',
       'This game is my favorite game ever. The graphics are amazing, the controls are great. I can\'t seem to find anything wrong with this game. Me and my brother love playing it. I also like that it is available on Google Play Store and the Appstore on iPhones. My old phone was an iPhone, and when I got my new phone I was worried that I wouldn\'t be able to play it, but thanks to Ketchapp and Google Play Store, I can still play it!! Also, I would like to suggest that you add a feature that allows you to create your own level, but it\'s not something you have to add, it\'s just something I think would make the game absolutely perfect for me. Then again, you may already have that feature and I haven\'t seen it/gotten to it yet. Anyway, it\'s an amazing game, and I hope Ketchapp keeps making amazing games like this!!! (BTW, Ketchapp games are my absolute FAV.) Thank you!! üöòüòäüöò',
       'This game would be great if it wasn\'t so laggy. Usually I would think it was an issue with phone storage or something, but I am on a new phone (note 8) and have only added a few apps in total. The game was smooth the first day or two but now the speed changes throughout play. The levels become impossible because the clock doesn\'t slow down even though the movement of the bike does.   Great concept and design. Hopefully that can be figured out if it is an issue on their side.',
       'Love it. Only thing is there is a glitch when you watch an ad for 200 thingy things you get a menu that lets you get 200 more. Than again, than again. Its better on our side than yours but it would be a good fox so you have to earn them! I love all your games, wish I had all of them but I have limited storage!',
       'Good game I figured out why I couldn\'t buy the bikes anymoreüòπ Anyway sometimes it gets a bit laggy but it doesn\'t last for to long. I told my friends about it and they love it it\'s fun to play when you\'re bored. All in all a good game:) Edit: Game:Score between 54 and 58 me: *scores 54* yes! *waiting* Game: doesn\'t count Me: great.' ,

       'Some games are very laggy for mobile players, some take forever to load. Not only that some players cuss and be mean or rude and alot of hackers.

I have played this game for about a year (different accounts) and I know you don\'t have to have robux to have fun (but it\'s better with robux). If you don\'t know what robux are they are money on roblox that you buy, you can make your avatar look awesome, and you can get gamepasses. I definitely would share this with friends and family. I think if you read this then you should play it. The only bad thing is the chat. It hashtags out a lot of stuff when you type on there.' ,

      'It\'s OK I love to play the game when I\'m bored and it helps me to be settled back and have a good time. But these all happens when I\'m offline. But when I\'m connected to Wi-Fi there\'s too many ads just slapped into my face. Yes I understand that you\'ll get these ads but ketchapp seriously,will you give and ad while I\'m playing the game??!! It\'s too much for me. But still I love the game so I just play it turning my Wi-Fi off in my mobile.',
       'Nice game but became boring in just one day! 2 options of controls: Spin (Steering Wheel) and Tap. Tap option is easier than spin. You have to complete the damn missions but the coins are only available in Normal mode they aren\'t available in arena mode. For making easy highscore follow this!! 1. Switch your controls to tap mode. 2. Open Arena mode. 3. In the beginning take the U-turn. 4. Keep driving in the middle line i.e in between of lane 1 and lane 2. 5. Just keep driving on that small line dividing both lanes and you\'ll get your highscore until and unless you get tired, I\'ve made it to 3,887.  Normal mode is quite harder than the Arena but it provides coins and you\'ve to play it for getting your missions accomplished!  Thanks',
       'It\'s stupid. It\'s really boring after your first try! And, when you come to a turn, the car doesn\'t turn fast enough. When you turn before a turn, it turns too fast. This thing is hacked.',
       'I know people were asking for different controls, but the new tap contols are turning the game into something so much less original.  Why don\'t you make the steering wheel work like in real cars?',
       'I dont know why people are rating Ketchapp games below 4 stars... I agree games are difficult but one of the unique one\'s in every launch. Their creativity is awesome... Love to play each of their games. Kind of more chanlenging and unique ones',
       'This is an amazing game! But there\'s a tiny problem with the controls: they are hard to be used. In addition, there are so many advertisments and that\'s the only reason I gave 4/5 Stars' ,

       'Although the game is really  good in every aspect, but when it comes to limited time events  i have to play day and night to win a car. It really gives you a bad effect on mind which ruins the fun of playing the game. They should be made a little easy which keeps the fun of playing. After the new update there is a problem. Whenever i see an advertisement to reduce waiting time for tickets, the time won\'t reduce and this happens like 10 to 20 times in a day.',
       'When I started playing this game I really enjoyed it. But now I realise that in order to progress, you MUST spend REAL money. I am a family man, with a wife and 6 children, I just wanted a game that I could play when kids are in bed and wife is in bath, I don\'t have cash to spend on games, the worst thing is the 7 Day events, you cannot beat them without spending money. Very disappointed. Good game but don\'t expect to progress very far if you don\'t want to spend money.',
       'The game is undoubtedly based on a pay-to-play foundation. Car Series is virtually impossible without spending money. Even with pulling all nighters, spending over 1000 gold, and not wasting a single ticket, I couldn\'t make the PR requirement for the final race of blackridge rumble. 7 days of suffering to get 40 blueprints.',
       'Its a good game but its too much of a "money making game" than a fun one. I feel like ive to race 5 races and put a few euro in.. now after new update u can get less free fuel, gold, i dont see free cash from watching ads.. im slowly dislikeing it and might delete it soon!',
       'I give the game 0 stars and EA 0 stars.  Very very slow to load.  Cheats all the time in black ridge rivals, more so now you have more cars to get passed pointless trying to win even against cars you should be able to win against.  And the points for winning or losing make no sense.  Can not see any point in playing this so called game any more.  Update 31st Jan 2018, black ridge is bad as it is but now I lose points and go from Icon 2 to Icon 1 after change from season 12 to season 13.' ,

      'Love it! I play it all the time! You can play online or offline - online gives you a chance to revive. Has course like game play or continuous. No pause which is understandable but kinda sucks. Once you get the hang of the controls it becomes  addicting. Would like to see more land and background options... maybe on the next update??',
       'I paid $2.50 for "Add free" but I still have adds! Refund me or fix the problem - this is unacceptable.  Update: My issue has been fixed and now I am a happy camper. Moved my rating to 4 stars. Would be 5 stars if I didn\'t have this issue for 2-3 days after my purchase. Overall it is a great, simple, and addicting game which is what I think mobile games should be all about. Best game since flight control lol.',
       'Cool game but the ads are irritating. I paid for the ad free but I\'m still getting ads. Contacting the developer and will request refund if they don\'t do anything.  Update: Has become so glitchy that I can\'t even play very well anymore. Still have ads and haven\'t received a refund.',
       'Great game, but the ad free version is a fraud. There are so many ads that the game is unplayable. I am convinced the dev created the ad free version knowing full well that he was leaving ads in it to collect even more money. Like many others, I have attempted to obtain a refund; however, I am resined to the fact that he has willfully stolen my money. Well-played, dev. I hope you get aids.',
       'It sucks. It\'s not supposed to be an ad display app with a game thrown in every once in a while. I opened the game, it showed an ad. Played the first time, it showed an ad and asked me to rate it. Played a third time, it showed an ad and asked me to rate it so I did. 1 star since I can\'t even find out if the game is any good because of the damn ads and whining for ratings.',
       'The game looks fun. I say "looks" because I saw a friend play it and I thought I\'d try it for myself. Every time I tried opening the game, all I got was the Voodoo logo and then whatever screen I\'d been on before I\'d opened the game. I\'d love to get a chance to play the game but this crash problem seems pretty common and a reinstall doesn\'t work. When I can actually play the game, I\'ll rate better. For now, I\'m going off of what I saw from my friend: a fun arcade game with good graphics and gameplay but too many ads.' ,

      'I love this game so much I think it\'s the best game any kid could have and whoever made this game has a very nice sense of humor because it\'s really funny and fun because when it goes to where you press the little bell  my sister likes it but I don\'t and I wish you would just not put that on your game it is so much harder for me to get back and I have to lose  my scores I would like you to please delete where  you press the screen and little white triangles pop up. I will get the scheme of five star. I should get at least a little of what I want. there so much wrong with your game. I can sue you and actually no I can\'t because I\'m a child. But if I could sue you I  wouldn\'t because listen here I\'m a nice person and I love your game did the message 4.7 do I make myself clear. Thank you. I am so sorry about the long message I ever granted real bad',
       'I love it, a great game to enjoy. If you like the older versions you will love this one just as much as I do! Plus there is an added multiplayer, now you can play against your friends or even random people if you want. Overall 5 out 5 rating from me!',
       'Are you interested in a knockoff of a much superior game? Do you want the illusion of playing the tiles to be broken when you miss a key but the music still plays on key? Do you want a subpar experience? This gane is for you!',
       'This is the best game I ever played in my life it\'s the best because it is relaxing as I would say and the song is so smooth and great hey who of you who didn\'t  download it yet do it now it\'s great and more so if it\'s not easy for you I mean it\'s fine because I just said that because I\'m really good at it so thank you. See y\'all next time again bye.',
       'I think this game is amazing i think if anyone scrown down pass this game they will reguet it it is so so fun and when you are going down pass the black things it almost makes a big bang so so so fun i love it you could sit there for hours and hours and not get bored and if ye like this one you should try the pink one so so fun as well',
       'Loved the game and even bought the ad free version but everyone  says in the comments great songs and i agree but what about  some songs that we actually know besides itsy bitsy spider? Only reason for the 4 stars rating.' ,

      'You\'re game is ok at best. It kinda really sucks that it takes way too long to upgrade ships or even make any gold playing the game in order to upgrade. And when I do play the aliens are disproportionately stronger than my ships and the power up come way to far and between to make the game overly enjoyable. And I don\'t want to have to spend that much money or invest that much time for a game on my phone. It could be a way more addictive game if you made a few upgrades to power up faster or earn gold quicker.',
       'Just purchased a Galaxy Pack, thinking I would get the 4 additional ships. Surprisingly, it didn\'t and just got robbed $6. Just messaged their FB page and never got a reply.   I recommend to have this gaming company closed down for scamming and robbing people of their money.   TWO THUMBS DOWN FOR THIS GAME',
       'Game randomly places a big red "buy" button right where the big red "play" button is.    I\'ve been given a message saying "could not process payment" several times without intending to buy.  My account is locked down on purpose.  It\'s a real shame because I want to give this 5 stars but can\'t because it\'s trying to contact me out of a lot of money.',
       'Addictive, challenging game. Looks like I\'ve topped out at level 47 in Campaign mode. I play this game many times a day but may lose interest if I can\'t proceed any further.  Also, I would consider purchasing add-ons, power, etc..., if they weren\'t so outrageously overpriced.  Update: it is impossible to clear level 48 with just 2 saves, one save is 2000 coins and the other is a crystal.  If you have more than 1 crystal you should be able to use them',
       'Spend $$$ in the 100s or waste 100s of hours getting what you need to "win" and on top of that half  of your time will be wasted watching ads between ALL beginner levels.  It is addictive, does not always work properly, NO customer support and constantly finds ways for everyone to spend their money on a make believe spaceship that is gone in seconds.',
       'It\'s a great little shooter that\'s easy to pick up. Only thing I\'d like to see is a way to pick which ship you\'re always using at the start instead of the starter green ship and having to rely on getting the ship you want to switch to to drop..., other than that this game earned the 4 star rating.  Edit: Now it seems that an update has zoomed the screen in so much that on the main screen theres icons being cut off and can\'t be seen.' ,

      'this game is a thousand times better than agar.io in my opinion! It\'s so much easier to get onto the leader board. Every time I play I get onto the leader board. It\'s just so addicting and I can\'t get enough. Everyone in my family loves it too. Creating your own skin is a great option as well. My only complaint is that the \'play online\' option is very laggy, and if you fix it would be much appreciated. Thanks for a great game, from me, ella, lauren, mollie, shane and ollie üòäüòä',
       'I\'ve recently upgraded from cubot to galaxy s7 and unfortunately the game is not working properly like it did on the old cubot phone. The screen gets stopping and it\'s impossible to play. I\'ve tried uninstalling and changing Wi-Fi settings but nothing worked. Other than that the game is sick! Love it,my kids love it and it\'s fun to play.',
       'So I think just about everyone has heard of this game... Buuuuuuut there are some newbies here so I\'ll explain. Its a multiplayer game and It\'s in my opinion that It is probibly #2 best game I\'ve ever played. Great concept and I like to get creative on makeing a snake/worm thing. A+ grade. üëåüëç',
       'Playing this game is total fun. But It would be more Awesome if there will be some sounds & a pause button maybe. One more thing, somebody tell me how to BOOST the Slither because everyone is boosting except meüò≠üòåüò∂üôÑüòìüòëüò´üôÉ',
       'The controlls are pretty bad considering how simple they are.  The lag is unbearable. Fix those and you\'ve got a 5star game all day. Simple fun pick up and put down time killer. In fact the lag is such an issue however, the game is getting uninstalled. You can\'t play a reaction based game when the lag has you 6 seconds behind whats going on.',
       'I\'m highly addicted to this game. It\'s a thousand times better then agar.io in my opinion and it\'s really cool that you get to create your own skin. The only downer is that I just wish there was some music because you start to get a bit bored after a while.This game is NOT a waste of time, and everyone needs to download it to experience the awesomeness!' ,

      'I like the mobile version better than the PC version because the touch screen works better than the mouse. I also love the food machine you can get for 12 diamonds. It\'s pricey but we\'ll worth the purchase. I kinda wish the pace of customers was a little bit slower so I had more time to prepare the food. I do wish however that I didn\'t need so many gems to upgrade every little thing. Or if I do need gems then maybe they could be easier to get instead of only getting 5 every time you level up. So, decrease the pace of customers and make the gems easier to get',
       'Love this game. Easy to play. My daughter and her partner both downloaded after playing mine.  When I first downloaded the game I didn\'t need to have the internet on. Don\'t know what happened but I know have to be on the internet to start the game but can then turn the internet off. Otherwise happy with it. So many restaurants to buy. And you can get ahead with the casino and keep playing everyday to get more money and gems. Thumbs up from me.',
       'this is a very well made game with excellent graphics and challenging play. It is however very money focused. The beginning levels are structured to encourage upgrades which at first are reasonable. Each later stage requires more diamonds to complete. The so called \'challenges\' are Impossible to complete without upgrading every implement so are essentially impossible for free play. Players beware!',
       'I love the way this game plays, and it plays like a dream. The grafics are wonderful, but there is just one flaw. The diamonds. You have to either play for a long time to earn more diamonds, and you can, or buy them with real money. And the game causes you to spend more diamonds than you can earn. From the atmosphere itself, to the food, and the appliances. Unless you have a lot of time and patience, or have the money to buy diamonds, this game might grind your nerves.',
       'Very nice graphics and addictive. The best thing is that it does not force you to pay for better progress. Ads are not noticeable. It provides a very comfortable playing environment.  It could be even better if the food can be more sensitive to touch. I always fail to grab those cooking food causing them to be burnt. Nice game overall though.',
       'I love cooking fever it\'s so fun and easy! My friend disliked it so I tried the game and l love it! I think you should be able to put tomato sauce on the burgers and onion on the sausages and there should be a movie food bit were you can serve food that you would get at the cinama like popcorn and slurpies because that would be AWESOME!' ,

      'The whole game is very amazing. Listening to the soundtracks can make you get motivated on playing the certain level until you pass it. The game can sometimes make you rage a little, and the colors can be little bit to neon and flashy for you. The whole point that I think about this game is that it tries to make it very challenging. The colors are beautiful in my opinion. The ads can me sometimes annoying, but you can turn on the airplane more so that they won\'t annoy you too much. Keep up the great work, RobTobGames!

       'Its a legit fun game to play but...  For me I get streshed because when I need to do it over again then u  streshed by not doing it...    Its still kind of a good game though..

       'Well, I admit, I\'m addicted to this. The levels are SO FUN, and also quite challenging. Sometimes,yes, I rage, but it wouldn\'t be fun if it was too easy.The animation is sophisticated, the music is AMAZING (my two favorite songs are Clutterfunk and Can\'t Let Go) and they give you a TON of levels for a free trial. I LOVE THIS GAME!!!! Thank you Robtop!!! üôåüòéüòç',
       'It\'s a real cool game, I do recommend playing this game because not is it only fun bit addictive as well. There are loads of levels so you never get Bored but warning ‚ö† the levels do get harder as u go further on. But yeah I do recommend playing this game it\'s super fun, super addictive and i would rate it a 4 star.',
       'So rage inducing! But i am a comete noob at your amazing creations. When o first downloaded it 3 yrs ago i hated it a deleyed after failing the first level before getting halfway. Some how though my abillity for rage cam control itself and yea. So in a way you made a rage game that helped my rage. Huh. Anyways great game might buy full version. Only if i can become a good player though',
       'Addictive & Fun I think GD Lite is super awesome and addictive. I think it\'s fun because it\'s challenging and there\'s super fun things in GD except hacking because that\'s no fun. Anyways GD is addictive because everyone gets it they beat a level get super happy and boom there into the game. And I\'m super happy because I beat every single level in GD Lite! I hope there could be even more levels!                                                        Challenging levels in GD I think Clutterfunk is the hardest even though I did beat it :D! But the most toghest is       Clubstep, Theary of Everything 2, and the one and only Deadlocked the three demons in GD! GD is awesome!!!!! :D :D :D &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 I love you GD!!!!!! üòéüòÇ' ,

      'One way to check how much products I have left is by touching the machine and thr corresponding product but sometimes the game will assume  that you are putting the product into production hence it will put the product into production whether you want it or not so it will waste production time. Sometimes the touch is too sensitive. Sometimes the touch is not sensitive enough which forces me to drag the product into the production slot up to 10 ten times just to start production. I know this feedback is not much but maybe an undo button will help. It makes the gameplay million times difference if you  put your players comfort a priority.',
       '√ÆnstaII " UNOPAY " App Enterr (GEMSO) to Start Earmings So far so good.Fun way to get money. Won\'t make you rich but the extra cash is helpful. It\'s also the best exchange rate on points. Uno points equals uc instead of like some of the others where it takes Uno points to reach uc etc....Also, √ÆnstaII " SUZICASH " App Enterr (SUHA) very reliable in paying you when you redeem to waIet/GEMs. You can choose assorted giftcards as payment or transfer to waIet for cash. Your choice. I love these guys thanks for addingsome fun to my day.',
       'I buy an axe it will last forever same thing with other tools but here I have to keep buying tools to do the job. An if I need more crop I get the land ready for more seeding get the water. This you have to bring in more people that never show up to do the work. That\'s why if I\'m going to farm I count on one person me. Here you need others. It not for me.',
       'Long time player returning to the game after taking a break. I leveled up to level 41 today. Before leveling up it showed I should get 1 white and 1 black rabbit with the new level but I didn\'t get either of them. I would also like to see it a bit easier to get wildlife refuge animals. 36 puzzle pieces seems a bit much.',
       'I love the game but going to give 4 stars because the newspaper should be in color! Please change this. And please give it a tan for mining tools and maps act so it don\'t take up storage space IJS my opinion!',
       'The game is addictive and nice to play. Please consider my suggestions and fix in the next or upcoming releases,  1. Reduce the time in the preparation of the jam machine as it consumes very long time. Else provide another machine  2. When we add something on the queue in the machine, there should be an option to remove the added item on the queue if the particular preparation not started. For example.  Am preparing product 1 in a machine and added 2 more products in the queue, later found that we have incorrect added the 2 more products, an option to delete that.   3. Why the puzzle moves to animal randomly, it\'s taking very long time to unlock an animal on the sanctuary. Hence request you to unlock one animal and then the puzzle goes to another animal.    Thanks.' ,

      'This game is simple. So simple that it is stupidly addictive at times when my mental and physical ability equates to a bowl of fruit. Nothing in this game brings me more satisfaction than the immensity of lag when bolts are caught in rapid bounce in a confined space. I say that with the utmost sincerity, no sarcasm at all. The lag is so intense, so joyful to watch. Please don\'t take it away from me. It is beautiful.',
       'Is this game for You? Do you enjoy spending most of the game watching ads? Do you enjoy games that make it impossible to play without spending real money? Do you enjoy being grabbed by the crotch so hard you change genders?  If you answered yes or no to any of these then no this game is not for you. It\'s nothing but a crappy game designed to rake in as much money as possible, rather than making something fun. Forced to watch 30 second ads after each round. Forced to use the currency you earn when you don\'t want too. Enemy power will suddenly jump up 10 fold making spells and goldimpossible to gain without watching an addition 30 second ad. Even if you win and get the key you are forced to watch a 30 sec ad to unlock as if you didn\'t get a key.',
       'Concept and gameplay is ok, but, like others have said, there are way too many ads. Also the special spells you can unlock are given to you at random. Have a aituation that drill would be great for? Too bad take explosion.',

      'The game loaded just fine but the controls are weird and there are SO many ads.. Wouldn\'t recommend unless you\'re just really bored and don\'t mind having ads ever 3 seconds:)',
       'Okay, Okay, Stop worrying about the ads. I must tell you that... This is not Minecraft, It\'s Dumbcraft. The reason is is that you can NOT activate Redstone (Bluestone) stuff cause preserplates, Buttons, and Levers don\'t activate and all you do is hit a thing. So don\'t download this.',
       'there are way to many adds there are so many I didn\'t even have time to load a game it i sutpid! I do not think you should play this game!',

      'I don\'t have any problem with the game but the problem is that I don\'t like that miniclip is adding the bot because the game is less popular or don\'t know but to win against a bot is very tough you cannot win a match against them. I am losing my many coin because of bots. To recognise bot player they will be in guest with 6 digit number and having same level or somewhat close to it.',
       'Every once in a while when I get on I try to click my free spin and it won\'t work. So it\'s like my phone froze but I can play every other app. So it\'s just this game that freezes every once and a while. I have shut my phone down and turned it back on but I\'m not going to do that for every time I want to get on the app. I do really love it. It\'s just that it freezes so I can barely play it.',
       'There is a bug in your game I went first of my league, supposingly I am entitled to 350 cash, but it wasn\'t there.  How could you make it so unfair for someone. Why bother having a prizes if not given to the right person.',
       'Uninstalled and reinstalled app because the update made it to where the game was unplayable. Went to login, using Facebook credentials. It says it failed because I would not allow them access to my friends list. Something doesn\'t seem right about that. Never had a game NOT allow me to login, after denying access to my friends list. Sorry, would prefer you not send messages to all my friends with my name tagged on it.',
       'I am in love with this game.. But the only bad thing happened today and I\'m very disappointed. I won carnival cup so I should get the announced price which includes 2 VIP  cards also. I didn\'t get my prize and I\'m really very upset. I have a screenshot of winning cup also.. I hope miniclip will help me. I\'m expecting my prize from you. I really love this game.',
       'Uncanny how the opponent in shooting race goes for the same target as me more often than not and is generally quicker. Seems similarly biased in free kick mode. It\'s almost as if you aren\'t allowed to progress unless you spend a load of money.' ,

       'It\'s so cute. I cant even describe how great it feels when youve been gone for a long time, then you come back to the app and see you have like 30 likes or so. It just makes you feel acomplished. I also enjoy how its not a pay to win game.',

       'Fun and very cute. Sometimes I\'ll tap on something and it won\'t work or I\'ll have to tap couple of times. Be nice if it had more games bit other than that very nice game.',

      'Amazing game... Loved it...üòç The tunes are AWESOME!!!  And Bryan swag zone At first even I thought that But... It is a maze so it\'ll obviously be twisted... (No Hate) It is actually that you should click maybe after the third or fourth turn to get it right... Even I took time to understand that So it\'s okay üòä',
       'I really wish you guys didn\'t update it. It truthfully bugs me that I can\'t listen to the full song on the menu anymore. The songs are absolutely amazing and the game is very addictive. I hope you will update the game again so that we can just sit and listen to these master pieces if we wanted. Thanks for an awesome game!',
       'It\'s an amazing game. Sure I run around my bedroom screening every time I fail next to the end.... but there is something about this game that makes you happy. Is it the music? Maybe. Is it the back ground and the way it moves?possibly. It\'s all of those things plus more   In a nut shell I really really really really really really really really really love this game :p',
       'Good songs. That\'s about it. The hitbox detection and lag spikes are horrific, the checkpoint system is a blatant cash grab, and what annoys the most is that the timing of music+taps (the core mechanic of the game) is completely broken. It is significantly easier to play the game with audio off, so that you don\'t get distracted by the miss timed turns. Doesn\'t even fulfill it\'s most basic selling point. Atrocious.',
       'The new system with hearts to get to continue from checkpoints is atrocious. People paid 5 euros or even more to eliminate these ads, and now what do we get? 4 measly hearts (i. e. 4 chances to continue from checkpoints) for watching 30-60 second commercials? If I would have known it would become like this I obviously wouldn\'t have paid for it. Shameful.',
       'This is by far my favourite mobile game to date. Loads of fun and not covered with ads like every other game out there (while there is a few this one isn\'t as bad). My only complaint is the new continuation thing. That wasn\'t there but now it\'s forced me to watch ads even though I played to remove ads.' ,

      'Thank you for constantly improving the game. Id say at this point not to add more but to fix and adjust what you already have. Fine tuning before more additions would be great. Optimizing sounds, movements, vehicles, rendering, scoping, responses, all that good stuff would be great. Its a little laggy but thats just what you get for a giant game and 100 million+ players. Love it either way.',
       'Fun game, especially since it\'s free. But I saw that this game supports controllers so I tried to use my pro switch controller with it and so far only 2 buttons seem to work, as well as a huge delay from input to actual action. And I can\'t seem to customize the controller layout, so I\'m just stuck with the Ability to walk and crouch/lay down with said controller. Can\'t aim or shoot.',

       'Yea sure there\'s some bugs, but pros totally outweigh the cons. The game runs beautifully on a good device. Most of the problems that people are having deals with their poor devices. Lol. New gears and new map are just awesome. Best game on mobile and very ambitious for portable. Bravo! Keep those updates coming.',
       'Hey NetEase Games, if you ever get the chance to read this I wanna tell you this is a great game and is really addicting. The problem is whenever I play the game it runs at a low fps and lags a lot especially whenever I shoot someone, do you know what is causing this and how to fix it? Reply asap :)',
       'Now its much better than before. But still not enough fps for play shooting game. I feel its really hard shoot 1person.  Becouse fps keep dropping while playing. Zenfone 2 ram 4gb. While playing i had 1 gb more and 8gb internal free space. I hope u can fix this.' ,

       'Ya hate ads? Turn off wifi and play. Stupid phone/gaming noobs. Its a good game and dont hate on it for ads. The ads make the people who made the game MONEY. Give then a break. Let them have money while u watch something u might want. If u wanna turn it off, like i said, turn off wifi.',
       'Would pay for the game to remove ads. I get you can turn off WiFi/data but it shouldn\'t be necessary, and is unfair to the company itself. Please offer a paid ad-free version!',
       'I genuinely liked the game it was fun and addictive but the ads is what kills it. Ad pop up like almost everytime you lose.. other than that its a grest game. The ads make me want to delete it. I hated giving this game a 1 star..',
       'Fun simple game burdened by a slew of constant advertising. Ads while you play, full screen timed ad when you restart (99.9% of time) and an optional 1 time 30s full screen ad to resume. Simply put too many ads!',
       'Fun game but way too many advertisements, which happen to blow through data. I\'ve spent about 1 hour playing the game and have gone through 224mb of cellular data. There is a 30 second ad after every single restart. Even if you goof up and get a score of 10. It\'s horrible. I have to turn off data in order to play the game, and then I can\'t do a 2nd chance. You neeeeeeeed to cool the ads' ,

      'The game has been majorly revamped and has benefited from it. It\'s so much better to see that content and events are happening more often. Hopefully we\'ll see the first wave of gen 4 by April or May and a nice egg event will happen to get a higher chance of a baby Pokemon from gen 4. Keep up the great work only downside is legendaries. I can\'t get them as not enough people in my area play Pokemon go and I\'m not travelling for a Pokemon. Can we have a legendary event for one week you can get 3* legendary raids? That would make it easier.',
       'I like the game, I was a bit worried to get it when it came out at first, but after installing it and learning how it generally works I like it a lot. I would love to see more pokemon added and maybe even some PvP/ being able to challenge other people around you some day. So far it\'s been great, I\'m not really sure why so many people have been so upset about it, but it\'s definitely a 5/5 for me so far.',
       'Constantly saying GPS not found (11). She jumps to random places and takes forever to even move. Its basically useless.. I was going to get a new phone to play this thinking it would work better but even after the update it hasn\'t changed. Waste all my data trying to play. Not happy. Disappointed.',
       'It is a fine game to play, if you want to waste time. Obviously, it is different from main pokemon game series. However, if you can\'t get the main series game(even through emulator), this is a alright game in my opinion to replace it. The raid boss is a pretty interesting concept and with the new wave of pokemons coming in, I would say the game has made progress for the better over the months. With raids, new generation of pokemons introduces and events.  However, there are some bugs in the newest update(with some from the lld update getting fixed). For instances, I did not receive any pokecoins from the gym despite my pokemon being there for more than 8 hours. And even when it said my pokemon have return with pokecoins, the pokecoins were not added to my balance of pokecois. So there is that.  Overall, the game is decent. Definitely better than it was before. However, there are many things it could improve on. So I am hoping for such improvements in the future.',
       'Tried it...Loved It! It\'s a game I can enjoy with my 8 yr old. More addicting than I thought it\'d be & I\'m 48 yrs old. I love the part where you walk & get rewarded while you do it. It can be disappointing when  eggs hatch and its a repeat monster but the candy you need to maximize it works itself out in the long run.',
       'Requires constantly lookong at the screen(unsafe while walking on street). Doesn\'t count steps traveled unless application is actively in use. No rural support. Not enough pokestops or gyms in my area parks or other public areas that are safe to access. No player vs player combat. No trading. Doesn\'t really seem like a Pokemon game, more of a gimmick.' ,

      'Well I downloaded it the other day and the app doesn\'t even get past 10% off loading app. Not exactly a good way to start out as a first time gamer for this game. Especially since I saw it in one of my other games saying to download it and get to a certain level and will receive 230 gems from the game I saw it advertised in. If the game does end up working since I uninstalled and reinstalled it just now! So if the app works and is actually worth playing i will change my rating',
       'Update: Since updating the game it doesnt force close as much but still does. Challenge 7 is impossible. Dont have enough time to complete the level. Please make easier for a higher rating. Its incredibly fruatrating when you use half your trophies on a level that is impossible to beat.   I used to love this game but lately it has been force closing and Ive been losing alot of things in the process. Ive spent my own money on the game so itd be great if this issue was fixed cuz I really do enjoy the gameplay.',
       'Personally I think this game is amazing, but it takes far too much time for dragons to sleep! I can understand 5-10 minutes but 20? Not so much. Normally this wouldn\'t be too much of a problem but the minutes only count if the app is open and you\'re playing it, theres nothing even remotely entertaining to do when your chalice is empty and all of your dragons are asleep. Now by no means am I a patient person but I feel like 20 minutes is too long to wait sitting there',
       'I am absolutely in love, and addicted to this game!! My favorite part is definately the holiday/special events. My only criticism is how long it takes to gain back a chalice. Especially when the levels start to require 3-5 per attempt. I know i\'d be playing a lot more if they generated just a little quicker! But otherwise the dragon\'s are adorable, and just the entire concept is really awesome!',
       'Instead of matching 3 shapes, this matches 3 of an object. Haven\'t seen another one like it.   Its hard to put down!! Being able to play parts of it offline is awesome. But this game eats ur battery so be ready. The valentine dragon is so adorable.  I just wish it was easier to get more. Only issue I have is that the controls are touchy especially if you have big fingers. Other than that i love it.',
       'I went from giving this a five star to a three star. It\'s  great game to play. But for whatever reason it\'s stopped "saving" my progress. Spent three hours playing today, only to come back to it and see I didn\'t have any off the stuff I did..thought it was a fluke so I played a bit more and then turned off the game, turned it back on and it again didn\'t have the stuff I did. At this point as much as I like the game I\'m most likely going to uninstall until this is fixed.  Update. Put down to a one star because it still keeps restarting my progress.' ,

    comments: 
      'Great timewaster! There are a lot of characters to earn and you don\'t need to spend real money to get them, so that\'s a plus. However, rated it a 3 cuz there are sooooo many ads. I get that ads generate the revenue to keep a good game free but an ad populates for literally every action. Win a game=ad, lose a game=ad, go to the settings=ad, change the volume=ad... ok the last one is fictitious but it really seems like that\'s how it works',
       'Love the game, its fun, addictive, and challenging. It makes you actually think before you do anything. The ads really are a bit much, being that after every single round in a tournament there is one. Also, one major thing, keep up with the updates. IOS users seems to have gotten an update with new characters and pvp mode even but not android',
       'The game is simple to immediately start playing and fun. I shouldn\'t rate a game based off of this but, these pop up adds are tremendously common. Adds are essential so that the app can support itself but to have an add after every single play and then have an add to open a chest? Really? That\'s a bit much, especially, when the adds are not easily skippable and even force you to the download screen of the add. The game is simple, fun, and has witty, silly, and quirky characters. But the adds are a bit much.',
       'Me and my son have had fun with this game and made an attempt to collect all characters. The game is set up so you can not earn all of the characters but have to buy the last couple in a cash grab. It would be fine if they we\'re only available for real money but the game gives the illusion that you can win them in a chest. One that we have spun over 50 times without success',
       'The game itself is enjoyable and the controls are quite simple. Very intuitive. But Jesus Christ on a frosty log, the ads are way to much. After every round, ad, want your prize? Ad. Wanna do anything in the game? Enjoy the ad. Jesus guys, I don\'t mind ads and I understand that\'s how you make money, but you shouldn\'t have to watch an ad to get your prize for winning... Come on.',
       'Everything else is great, EXCEPT the amount of ads... I love the game, but I don\'t want to keep turning on and off airplane mode so I can actually enjoy it.  Edit: there are ads after I go into settings and more information, which doesn\'t leave the app!? Seriously? And the "messages" are all more ads for other apps too, lol. Bro calm down with the ads. This is why I\'m now uninstalling.' ,

I hope my tears will help u guys. :)',

I originally posted this way back in 2015 and yet you said you are constantly improving the game??? We try and give you the developer new ideas but it seems that no one bothers to read our comments? I guess it\'s just a lack of interest. Hopefully this time someone will read it............',

       'At first I wasn\'t sure how good the game was but after playing it several times on Android and Windows 8.1 phone, I like it.  It doesn\'t weigh down on the phone\'s processing power. A very addictive game!! Give it go.',
       'Was good but each new change detracts from the gameplay. Kept hoping it would focus more on adding features to the game play. Multiple paths, more challenging sections, etc. But recent additions just seem to be focused on selling more upgrade packs. Sad.' ,

      'This is a very good game,  I know there are a lot of ads so I just turn on airplane mode. However on My phone there is another set of numbers between the hundred thousands and millions. For example it will say I have 221,444 K, and I will hit a ball and get 30,927, then it changes to 211,474 K, but my next upgrades cost 1,846 million, and that is literally impossible to reach with it doing this.',
       'Way to many adds just like everyone else has said. 2 swings and an ad. I dont mind the ads at the bottom but every other swing an ad pops up. The game itself is great which is why i gave it two stars but come on guys cool it with the ads. Downloaded 10 minutes ago and i already want to delete this game',
       'The game is (AD) really fun but (AD) Kinda addictive, (AD) It\'s a great (AD) time killer.  Great for road (AD) trips and great for litt(AD)Le kids, 6.5/10 would recommend  (AD) to you if you like ads every 5 seconds.... just one think I don\'t like, all the ads.... look I know that\'s how you make money on here but you would make more with the x2 money thing after the ball lands, I think I\'ve spent more time watching ad forcefully then playing the game, I would watch the ads for the ingame money but I already watched 4 before I swing the bat',
       'Ok Voodoo, the ads, are ridiculous. Yes, we all understand that you need ads to run as a company but 2 swings in and I get a full on 30sec ad. And every 2 swings after that, ad. Horrid. It ruins the gameplay. I wouldn\'t be surprised if someone else used the mechanics of all your games and actually make it playable version of it with reasonable ads in between. Listen to the people who are commenting for one Voodoo. EVERY SINGLE GAME YOU RELEASE HAS THIS STUPID ISSUE. Until this gets fixed, I forsure am going to never recommend a Voodoo game ever again, just because of the ads.',
       'Too many ads I mean I know games have ads but this game has eay too much. Everytime I finished hitting the ball anotjer ad comes up and it gets annoying so im going to guve the game a 1 star.',
       'Okay.  So you might as well hit double up and watch the ad for the double reward on every swing, because every single swing after that ball stops you\'re gonna watch an ad anyways.  But don\'t try to buy ad free mode.  Last time I bought ad free mode on a voodoo game they took my money, refused to give me ad free mode, and will not respond to my customer support emails, so save your money.' ,

      'I started this game when it first came out. There were hardly any game advantages and everyone was having fun and on the same playing field. As more and more packages got released into the game it became a pay to win situation. I personally do not think spending $100+ on a phone game is a wise investment. Thus I enjoyed the game by taking advantage of their events and the prizes within the game. However, it has become dominated by people who payed to be the big guy and the little people get absolutely demolished. It has taken the fun out of playing, which really dissapoints me as it was a fun game to play.',
       'This game has potential to be fun but it\'s completely ruined because IT\'S COMPLETELY PAY-TO-WIN which sucked the fun out of the game that I quit. Don\'t get me wrong, Final Fantasy is highly respected RPG franchise because it\'s full of great games in the series. But no this one.  However, I might come back if the game developers make it not as pay-to-win as it is now. Right now, it\'s a complete money bucket!',
       'This game is great and fun, I love spending my time playing this game. One problem though, what is going on with the packages? Why is it every time a package is bought all the packages go from 20 to 100 dollars ? We should be able to buy the 20 dollar packages more than once! Is that fixable? Please cuz i do want to keep playing but 100 dollars is too much.',
       'The game is very addictive and fun to play. Some of the people playing the game are wonderful and fun to game with. Graphics are very good for a on line game played on phone, tablet or computer. The quests are challenging at best. BUT!!! BE WARNED... This game is not for young children as there is explicit language and cut throat people playing the game. After all it is a war game and nothing more. Now down to the nitty-gritty of the game. Yes it\'s free, but that only get you so far before you will need to buy packs in the game to advance and unlock the two new characters. The game quests are designed for people to spend if you want to get ahead fast. Large amounts of  $$$$$$ Cash are needed to play this game. $$$$$$ Personal note, I know people who have spent thousands on this game. Over all the game is great for young adults on up. PG-15',
       'This game is great and will make you feel tho go all out. It challenges you in a healthy way and keeps you on your toes. Join a guild, trust me. You can do a lot by yourself but joining a guild in this game is actually fun. I haven\'t experienced anything toxic, yet. I\'ve been playing for about a week and it\'s really great',
       'All the advanced features (such as the mythic forge or oracle) cost $100 each just to unlock and even more to upgrade. Pay to win players are nearly impossible to beat. And the strong always prey on newer weaker players. Being successful in this game is more about the size of your wallet than your skill. It is easy to learn, the controls are simple and it does have good graphics. If you play passed level 20 it is key to guard your hero at all costs.' ,

      'I played Game of War for appx 3 years.  The game started out great, everyone was on a somewhat even playing field. The game advanced to quick and left thousands of players behind. Other Players and I felt we could never keep up.  I hope this game advances at much more slower rate.  We all spend money to enjoy the game!    Don\'t be gready like GOW.  Thank you in advance.  Kirk',
       'Overall great game, however to play and be competitive ait is important to spend. In fact just to unlock some features you must spend at least .99 which is fine by me since I love to spend on this game anyways. I have been playing koa from the start and when this game came out I jumped on the bandwagon in the first 50 kingdom servers. So with that said yes it is LOTS of fun, I love my GoG family and definitely addicting LOL see you on the burning war field ;)',
       'It is a fun game and is the most indepth game I\'ve ever played. That all being said, unless you have a ton of money and a lot of time there is no way this game is worth it. I\'ve spend over $100 and play multiple times per day and I still find it hard to level up my estate. Even in an alliance unless they\'re all very high level it isn\'t much help. I\'m sure they\'re are much better games in this genre then Guns of Glory. To me it seems like a game for wealthy people and made by a company to just make money.',
       'What a great game!  Need to have introductory levels for newcomers, though.  You build your kingdom up and larger kingdom\'s just rush in and destroy you.  When you recover, they come right back.  Level into the attack mode, so people will enjoy the game more.  I am uninstalling after 6 weeks of running an Alliance, because it\'s just not worth the trouble.  Great concept, fantastic graphics!',
       'Love this game! Very entertaining, never boring. My only complaint is with some of the collecting events. You have to do certain things to obtain the necessary items to put together, but for some reason with the current one you don\'t get enough of one item, and too much of another. It would be great if you could trade within your alliance for things like this.',
       'Hey good game. Having played this type of game for almost 2 years, I\'m very happy with the rollout of this game. I only wish that the in game translator was better. So many wars start because you can\'t translate Russian, Chinese and most middle eastern dialects. Those wars often result in people quitting the game. All around, a very fun game. Even if you don\'t spend money!!' ,

      'FORCED ADS! I loved playing this game for years but had to bring the rating down atleast one star because of the forced ads that I usually refuse to watch in games. So now my sessions playing this game end as soon as an ad shows up. Very disappointed.',
       'Great game with I could communicate a little more and I hate the new adds I have been playing for a long long time now and the new video add are way too long you can\'t skip them it\'s way faster to close the app and reopen it, yeah its that bad and the. You have a stupid mini preview game of the add and it\'s a pain to exit',
       'The ads are ever increasing, I don\'t pay for games and being forced more and more is a deterrent to continue playing. Turn it down a notch.... edit to developer reply...that doesn\'t explain why more and more ads are popping up. What was wrong with it before?  Getting greedy with get you nowhere.',
       'It\'s a fun game, great for passing the time. That being said it suffers some very problematic connection issues, if I tab away for even half a second it disconnects me and causes and auto loss',
       'I thought it was a really good game and very addictive. I wish that instead of you losing when you\'re connection is down the game should carry on until you join again. I\'ve lost loads of battle\'s that where going really well then lose connection and it won\'t reconnect so I get a loss. Also there are loads of ads.',
       'Ranking system is horrible,  to many game options make matching a hassle.  Defence mode is to hard to play even though its made to be like single player, very discouraging.  Then when you get into it the game it crashes.  This happens frequently, very upsetting I don\'t know how this game has a 4.4 star rating.  It also throws ads at you randomly as well as has pay to win with  the ability to buy metals.  One or the other please.  Not made for the player at all.' ,

      'I don\'t think I need to \'review\' much here. There are some points I definitely don\'t like about the game. Such as the matchmaking... You get matched with the same deck type in a row. Other than that and some minor flaws it\'s a great game. I love the competitive aspect about it.  Finally I would suggest some 2v2 with different game modes, such as ramp up 2v2. Also, add the rematch button in 2v2 challenges with random mates.  Hope I hit the 4,3k this season. Good luck to all clashers!',
       'I think Clash Royale is a great game to play and is very well put together for all ages, it is a fast paced game and at the same time can be played with an individual pace of your own to a degree being that there is a clock ticking, also new characters are released at a well balanced rate, so that the game doesn\'t become boring and the regular balance of the characters strengths and weaknesses are balanced to make the game more competitive. I recommend this game for all ages and abilities. It\'s great for a few minutes or an hour or so and this game also has several different tournaments you can enjoy yourself or with a friend or a teammate. See you soon on Clash Royale. A.K.A. Dad.',
       'Supercell, I think your best game is hay day. Clash royale on the other hand isn\'t one of your better games. Android is better than apple. Why would you ever support apple instead of android. You released Brawl Stars only for apple. You should have less medieval/fantasy games unless you make the knights, princes etc. More realistic. In my opinion I think you\'re better at making farm and army games. Please make more of thoseüòñ',
       'This is the only game of its kind. Many companies try to copy, but this is the original and the best. There are  endless possibilities of card combos and decks that you could use making the game always entertaining. My only complaint is that the trainer is way too easy to beat. It is one of few games that you could get competitive without using your own üí∞. I also like how the stuff that u unlock in the beginning does not go to waste later in the game.',
       'What do we do?  I have been playing this game from 9 months now. In these 9 months i got 3 Legendary Cards 2 from chest and 1 from Clan Chest. But the thing is that all of them were Ice Wizard. I\'m in Arena 9 from 2 months now Because i dont have the cards to win. I check the tv royale every time i open the Game for a good deck But. So Supercell tell me what do i do? I can\'t push to Hog Mountain then what do i do in this game? Please do something',
       'Really a awsome  addictive  game.. but its not a fair play..  It  offered me only one  legendary card as I am playing from the beginning.  In the other hand one of my friend started playing just 4 months ago but he owned 5 legendary cards. one from the crown chest, another from the legendary chest and recently he got another one in the super magical chest. Now you decide. Is it a fair play?.  Really Disappointed üëé. And on the other hand it is pay to win game.. In some cases skill doesn\'t work .' ,

      'Good graphics but the character movements are clunky.  I\'m a hardcore FPS gamer and I like to test the limitations of a game.  So tried shooting a shoulder and the bullet went for a headshot instead whereas I clearly know my aim would miss. Glitchy.  Clunky and not so realistic unfortunately.  So not sure why the high ratings.',
       'Is game could be so much more than it is! After a few weeks, PVP becomes a joke when you are up against paying users who have one shot kill guns and a barrage of armour.  Then single player is just rinse and repeat over and over again.',
       'Free to download, pay to win game. You can only play for a VERY short time before stalling out and being forced to buy stuff to continue. I\'d avoid unless you plan on dropping cash on the game to play',
       'Could be a fun game if it wasn\'t for the constant pushing of buying premium packages ridiculous cost involved in doing anything. When will these companies realise. I will pay a few pounds for a good game but I dont want overpriced micro transactions and constant adds',
       'R U B B I S H.  Allowed 3 shots then I was being forced to spend some real cash. I felt I was being tricked so I uninstalled it and found a game I could play & evaluate prior to any cash spend. Developers think about this, gamers are not idiots & we are part of your income, so give to receive.',
       'Love this game me and my husband plays it... Love everything about this game keeps up entertain during down times and before bed the only thing I think would make the game better would be if this game would let you sale the weapons that you buy but don\'t need no more' ,

      'Great game. Challenging, fun, and addictive lol. I\'m 32 and play this often so it\'s not just for kids . Give it a try it\'s very satisfying . Just wished you could add friends ... People that play whom you may not know so we all could help each other. That would make it more interactive and a lot more fun. No one I know plays so it would have to be other fellow fishermen üòâ',
       'Fantastic game! It\'s great fun decorating the aqariums and the game board is very clear. The recent move of the boosters to the right hand side of the screen was a VERY bad decision, as I have accidentally used them when my hand has brushed against them - this has happened many times already. A good addition would be a marker indicating a purchased item.',
       'I love this game, its very challenging. The only thing I don\'t like is that your aquariums end up way overcrowded with stuff before you can move to the next aquarium. Of course you can move on to the next one as soon as its unlocked, but I won\'t move on until I have all 3 stars. So honestly, I guess this is just my issue. I probably should have given it 5 stars, because my issue is the only reason I didn\'t.',
       'Oh this is so cute! Other match games don\'t give such a reward - it\'s like playing a decorating game also! It would be very helpful to grey out or list the items & fish already purchased. It\'s easy to duplicate items which wastes coins earned & doesn\'t count towards trophy challenges. I don\'t like the bomb boosters on the right as I\'ve accidentally used them when not needed. I haven\'t spent any real money on this game. I just keep retrying the level. I\'m on level 644. Lots to go yet!',
       'I love this game I just wish it was more interactive with the fish in one\'s tank. Like when you pet them little hearts appear and one can earn happiness points with so many touches. I also wish that one could still earn something for previous tanks. I have no real reason to visit my first and second tank. I don\'t earn anything for more decorations and it doesn\'t get dirty and the fish don\'t get hungry. I feel bad for them, but I focus on my current tanks.',
       'I absolutely love this game! Yes, the levels get more difficult, but that\'s to be expected. No money needs to be spent here, as long as you have patience. However, I did spend some when things were getting tougher. I love the things the fish say. They make me smile and even laugh sometimes. I love the special contests, even if I don\'t win. The heart of this game is having fun. Thanks for a wonderful game. I recommend it highly! üëçüèº‚ò∫' ,

      'I love the gameplay, graphics and controls and this is just so relaxing to play! I love this compared to other sandbox games because of the controls are way better! Also when you take a pic and colour it in can you have a palette so you can colour it in different colours to the image that would be great if you could kinda edit photos by using different colours.',
       'Amazing! The only problem is that I might accidentally touch a number I already coloured and undo it. To fix this problem I suggest you make it so if you have completed a number it cannot be changed.',
       'I really  really like it!! But sometimes the LAG annoys me so MUCH!',
       'There\'s a problem where when you tap a certain number is unpredictably colors in the numbers around it instead of the number you intended to color. It\'s makes it impossible to color it in.',
       'I would give it 5 stars but there is this problem when I added more then 1 custom and the numbers of the colors won\'t show up and a I can\'t color it in..',
       'It is amazing and I love it when ever u don\'t have wifi or internet u can still play it so I highly recommend it' ,

      'To anyone saying the magnometer should be free; no, it shouldn\'t.  You guys are requesting it be free because it is in demand, which is exactly why it is for sale.  Parents don\'t let you buy things on the app?  Good. The magnometer is something EXTRA that is absolutely not necessary for the app to function.  Sure, it can help make the right move; that\'s why you have to pay for it... Without the Magnometer, you are playing a free chess app.  With the Magnometer, you are playing a free chess app and paying for it to help analyze your moves.  You are not entitled to a free move analyzer to help guide you simply because you want it to be free.  That\'s not how economics works, hate to break it to you.  There are many, many ways to analyze moves, positions, and get better at chess; the Magnometer is not and will never be the best way to do so. It is simply an added convenience that you can choose to pay for to help you find or analyze a move/position.',
       'Feels great to have a simulated match with a Magnus-like computer AI opponent. Will definitely destroy you even at the lower age levels. The only thing I don\'t like in the app is the gray color graphics of the board and the chess pieces. The upside about this is you can surely change that setting if you got the appropriate in-game currency to purchase a different color scheme, with some playthroughs that are needed first to be able to get them.',
       'Good job It seems like that you are not paying this app any attention anykmore. I dont understand what was the need of another Magnus Trainer app. You coukd have very well integrated the same fuctionality here. You closely missed the opportunity to create the best chess app in the world. Alas....',
       'Sound effects and graphics are distractingly poor. Missing basic features like turn confirmation. You can see a video on YouTube of Magnus himself making a mistake in placing a piece using this app.',
       'This chess game is very good, I would give it five stars except for an internal error that will not post my record of wins, losses and ties against Magnus. Maybe I fried the memory with all my losses...üòÅ',
       'Love the idea behind it. Well executed and a really fun feel to the game. Wish there was a 3d board option- have always found flat 2d chess board graphics frustrating to read.' ,

      'Another great game from ketchapp. A very unique idea, executed well and with nice graphics. It is simple yet difficult, a good combination. I gave it 4 stars however, as sometimes the game takes a while to respond to my touch, and often doesn\'t respond at all. My phone is quite slow though, so I\'m willing to give the game the benefit of the doubt.',
       'Fun little time killer. My only problem is that daily rewards fail to show up most days. It could be a problem on my end, but I don\'t know, and it\'s a pretty small issue so I don\'t really care.',
       'I\'ve noticed that when I get higher in the challenges the ones involving lane switching glitch out and never let me complete it. I have counted and I don\'t think it is possible for me to have counted incorrectly 20+ times repeatedly. Also now whenever I boot up the game it has the beginner tutorial pop-up telling you what to do which is annoying.',
       'Way too fast to even comprehend incoming obstacles. Wouldn\'t install unless you\'re a master at controlling your temper and have a bucket full of patience, and then some. Really wanted to like this app! üòï',
       'Quite challenging and kinda hard because of its speed (maybe thats why it was named "Rush" lol) but over all it is a nice game. Thumbs up!',

      'Do NOT go for high level military research without searching monster hunting, and Do NOT go for T4 if you not going to spent thousands of dollars. Even if you don\'t mind to wait 200 days, you will not able to afford it (lvl 10 military Def, Atk, Health cost 100m gold each).

       'This game is fun but be prepared for the mother of all Pay2win games.  These folks at IGG are experts at crafting new and exciting ways at fleecing their customers of every cent they can.  You CANNOT compete if u dont pay and pay often.  Players here ...just regular people... dump hundreds of rl $$$ regularly.  You have been warned.',
       'If you like spending mad money to be an Internet tough guy this is the game for you.

       'Game Sucks! Super high levels can come in wipe you out, seems like if they had a level limit, let\'s say 5 levels above you they can\'t attack, but O NO!!  Every day I come in to find I have been attack by a level 25 and I\'m only a level 14. It takes days to rebuild, so yeah everyday same thing, about to uninstall this game not worth it to me...',
       'Misleading sale information! ! Current Fortune Ticket sale is misleading and horribly overpriced.  "Give your guildmates 10 Fortune Tickets!" for $19.99 should give ALL guildmates 10 tickets EACH. Instead it gives 10 tickets TOTAL for the guild to fight over!! Since MOST of the guild is left out, how can I give them a Fortune ticket as stated?? There is a comparable  $4.99 offer that gives 50 Fortune chest, 2000 gems, and resources. Each Fortune ticket is equivalent to a Fortune chest.... DO THE MATH! ! I submitted the error to online help and was DENIED!',
       'Coloseum is BS. I think one reason is because you cant control who you can attack. I mean come on, auto battle sux really. You can be defeated by a low level and low rank with same type of heroes seriously? I would rate this zero if i could but bad luck for me i couldnt. Its getting worst everday. Ever since i rated this game, i never won a single battle in colo. Really? I wish i can rate this zero. This game is BS. No improvement ever since. I think i have edited this 3 or 4x already and nothing has changed. I gave up colo is BS.' ,

      'All the main movie characters and space ships to use. Wish u would make more farmable but over one of the best games out there. I actually prefer it compared to Xbox due to no issues with extensive network down periods. If u want us to pay then we gotta be able to play when we want right? Someone else should send that to Xbox they stopped caring long ago. Well done again for the game',
       'Amazing game. Really hits me in the childhood. Great mechanics, events, character moves/abilities, great art style, and unlike most mobile games, does not require paying a dime. It may take a while to reach a high level, but with practice and dedication, you can really go far in this game. I even recommended it to a lot of my family members. Would rate higher than 5 stars if that were an option. No problems whatsoever with the game.',
       'This update gave the players most of the things they have been asking for over a year now. The only issue i have is that EA is still pushing its pricing model with this game. 300 dollars to full star up a character + another 200 for gear. Its a bit much. The F2P is still full and while you will be hardpressed to make it to number 1 on your shard it is possible and gives great satisfaction. I would recommend atleast giving it a try.',
       'Just d/l this like a week ago. Very good game, the turn based RPG style works well, the graphics are top notch, as well as the sound is accurate and superb. The only thing is: I just updated it and now cant get past the Lucas film/Disney screen now. The update was not interrupted at all when I downloaded it, but I suspect it got corrupted, contacting support, hope they can help me I do NOT want to start over.',
       'The game looks interesting, but when you\'ve finished the tutorial you have to give permissions to Contacts (and then maybe other permissions), which is a big red flag for me. There is absolutely no reason ask for permissions like this just to sign up, with no way to proceed and gracefully opt-out!  Beware that by giving them the Contacts permission you are giving away other people\'s information, not just your own! \'Just say no\' to invasive app permissions.',
       'I\'ve been playing this game for a good year. It is the one game on mobile that I\'ve never put down. I love the grind and how rewarding it is. It is not pay to win, and you can max out every character without paying a cent. EA made something truly great here! Ecspically if your a die hard star wars Fan! They update almost monthly always with new characters! 11/10!' ,

      'Tekken is one of my favourite series in gaming. Previously i have some minor issues about all old getting delete but now my all data have recovered thats a minor bug in the which automatically log out your account from google play game or in facebook and then starts from beginning again but i have fixed this problem, for solving this problem just re-login in the game via play games or facebook, you get your data back. And seriously this is good game i love it, i am addicted of it.üòäüëç but we need more characterüòÖ.',
       'Do u call this game management and do u guys call this a game... I just upgraded my phone software... Reinstall the game and lost all my account..everything i worked on it.. I tried reconnecting to my Google account.. It gave me the link to my previous account and asked me to restart the game...but nothing happened... I need my damn account',
       'Was excited, even pre-registered. But not happy with the cost and chances of getting characters worth paying with. And what are the pre-registration benefits. Not got any. It encourages you to buy characters worth real world money, lots of it. No. Becomes routine after some time. Only Injustice and the Batman Arkham games are the best, others are the rest.',
       'Thanks a lot for a fast reply. Game is awesome, though there might small small issues, but it\'s at an initial stage as well... I am expecting for the local challenge event to come soon... üòâ',
       'Need a help from you Bandai Namco. Why i start again at level 1. Where\'s my level 36 account with more than 1K gem and 500thou+ coins. I did not clear any data on my phone. Please, fix my issue guys.',
       'I was really annoyed today... But its fixed now... Thanx guys... Hope u make this game even better.. Namco lived up to the expectations...' ,

      'Really a great little game. One of the only issue I\'m having is that switching/removing captains is quite bothersome, a simple remove button on the map screen would be nice. And a way to see how many cargo shipments you need to fulfill a contract; it gets a bit tedious pulling the old calculator out just to be as efficient possible with the cargo management. But other than that; a really nice game and a good source of entertainment',
       'Every time I close out of the app and reopen it there is a flash of the loading screen then it goes black and I can\'t get passed it. I have to uninstall and reinstall the app and it works a few times then the problem persists. Please help me because I really love this game. I play on a note 8. EDIT: The game is no longer playable it just opens to a black screen even after uninstalling and reinstalling, which is why I went from 3 stars to 1 star.',
       'Awesome game. Crashed on error 2005. Starting up gives me a black screen now. Any advice? Reinstalling doesnt seem to fix it.  Edit: upon further investigation the problem seems to originate from the save data linked to my google+ account.',
       'It\'s a fun game but like most games of this genre you\'ll find many elements locked behind paywalls and LONG wait times. This, of course, "encourages" the player to buy premium items with real cash or suffer through the grind. Personally, I\'d rather pay 5$ outright for this game than have all these microtransactions and to have wait times not exceed 60 minutes but...that wouldn\'t make the devs of these games enough money, right? Because it\'s never enough...   P.S. I keep getting a reload error code 2005...not sure what\'s the issue?',
       'Constantly receive error:2005, it asks to reload the game and just gets stuck at a black screen until I force close. Doesn\'t do a good job of explaining ship stats and when it\'s better to buy a new ship vs upgrading an older one.',
       'It was a great game when I first downloaded it, it\'s was really user friendly. But now after three days, every time I get into the game, it keeps wanting to restart saying that there has been a error. Please fix.' ,

      'Okay heres the thing,every f game is with money and this game was so much better without those money,i was 1000 lvl and my tom is gone why? Cuz u didnt made that feature back in the days,also u made this stupid diamonds alll for money,and not coins like it was...its not all about money get it? This game was so popularbback in the days and now is trash with all those videos to watch all those money you need to spend on clothes for tom...its ridiculus...sry for my english im just disapointed cuz u turned this game in real money not coins where you can be able to buy everything by playing like i did....',

       'I like this game very much. I have played this game from 2,3 years but I don\'t the recent update of this game in which the premium galactic and royal fittings beddings, clothings are brought by diamonds which I don\'t like. Before this update these things are brought by coins and now these are brought by diamonds which I hate it and give it 4 stars.',
       'This game used to be fun not no more, it restarts my whole phone and then I go to play it, and it freezes my phone up, or it shuts off and it goes back to the home screen, fix it and might redown load it. If not then I\'ll never play this game again.',

And I was about to uninstall it..     2_one of the question was you can play with other users offline. This is not correct!...     3_ need to add "Edit and changing names"     4_Game rated with 5 star.. Than you all üé±',
       '"Cusion shot on 8 ball" games are great, woukd be cool if one was created at a lower buy-in though.  I think its currently like 8 million needed to play a bank the 8ball game.  I personally like the No Guidline 9ball games,but would love a cheaper bank the 8 game.    Also, well done on adding the upgrade-able cue sticks.  That alone, i think, has made this game much much better.',
       'Likes- 1) The game is pretty addictive.  2) Graphics is good.  3) Variations are cool.  4) Game controls are awesome.  5) You need skills and timing. 6) Stats keeps you update how you       are performing.  7) You make friends while playing.  Dislikes -  1) It\'s also a game of money so....  2) When you win too many games       you get tougher opponents.  3) Despite having good Internet      connection the game disrupts in      between by disconnecting it.  4) The game starts controlling you        in winning or losing.',
       'I realize y\'all gotta get paid but why make the playing experience for those of us that don\'t pay cash money.  Not allowing a player to select a pocket when shooting the 8 ball and allowing your opponent to shoot and win. I guess I\'m pretty good because nobody has been able to get rid of me playing pool. Instead I seem to get strange lock ups or no response from game. I always seem to lose 100s of thousands. It\'s a pretty good app and I\'ve sent many people to download your app.',
       'Best pool graphic wise but the game is not fair what so ever. Game is Controlled you don\'t decide if you win the game does. Your win percentage and rank don\'t mean squat. Cues length and force controlled to games advantage even when reloaded. I had 6,991,000 and my win percentage was 61.3 and lost 1 million 5x in a row. How do I have a 61.3% chance of winning and lose so easily by these 40-50% players like nothing. If you don\'t actually buy stuff with actual money on app game will treat you poorly.',
       '8 ball i have been playing it for sometime now and I spend alot of money on the specials.. great specials.. but I noticed whenever I buy coins I don\'t win any games until those coins are over and I\'m only winning recently 2 games maximum in a row and normally my win streak used to be 7 and above... I don\'t know why this is happening but it sucks because it\'s putting me off the game.. it\'s like 8 ball is making sure I\'m losing hence the rate 3' ,

Don\'t worry about getting low scores, because the game starts out slow and gets faster, so you\'ll always be prepared for faster tiles.  There are challenges where you challenge other people in the world!  I never want to give up on this game, its really addicting!',
       'This game has no WORLD\'S favourite song  DESPACITO  SO i m hating it tooooo much  when i see this then i think that let\'s download it bcoz it contains despacito song also but when i see all album of this app then i started hated it. So i would request from CHEETAH GAMES that plezz add DESPACITO SONG also in it This is my humble request from CHEETAH GAMES.',
       'This game is honestly a great time-killer and even has it\'s challenging parts, but from what I\'ve noticed as you get to the higher tier songs they just get slower and slower and are just flat with barely any challenge. I expected more of a challenge with a higher level but now this game is getting horribly boring.',
       'It\'s been 4 months since my report that the game has such a major glitch, still NO improvement. I lost so many lives just because the song suddenly slowed down and then as suddenly fast forwarding itself, there\'s no rhythm at all. Why don\'t you just fix the glitch first rather than add more songs.. Now, at 2018, it\'s only getting worse..',
       'Great game. Played to level 120 and have over 500 gems but then I switched devices. This requires a Facebook account which I did not have. It worked for a little bit until Facebook disabled my account for doing nothing. They need to fix the method they use to sync progress. Now I am level 3 with 17 gems.',
       'You should add a way to transfer progress. Not copy but transfer so i (and probably many others) transfer to a new account. That would be helpful. And I don\'t know what that freaking "slow down redirection" thing is but it screwed me up!!' ,

      'This is by far the best chess "trainer" for me.  It\'s got a nice flow and the game isn\'t "stupid" like most other chess apps/games I\'ve played.  I plat at least a few games every night and I feel like it give me a nice challenge and makes me really think about the moves I\'m making.  Especially at the higher difficulty levels.  Overall a great chess app with no glitches and a good brain inside of it.  A must for a chess player with any real skill at the game.',
       'I love this game and the best brain exerciser game ever in the history.  The cool 3d view makes the game as if I am playing on the real board, very good graphics. However, it doesn\'t show the list of killed chessman during game play the only drawback. I am expecting this upgradation and this will be the perfect Android chess.',
       'For the non experts, let me tell you that 5his game cheats. I sat with a real chessboard to analyse why wasn\'t I  able to crack master level.   And what i observed was it didn\'t allow you to make actual moves when you show high levels of intell8gence. Sometimes it makes moves which are faulty. I think there is some mistakes in coding, perhaps deliberately made.  So not a fair play but a foul play.',
       'So far it\'s o.k. I like the fact that it is simply a chess game with no fancy sound effects or graphics. I see no real reason to have the higher difficulty levels locked out until they are beaten but they are. I got it to practice with. It is useful for that. It\'s not bad...Just a simple down to earth chess game',
       'The game has been drawn because the other player has no legal move and is not in check. If they can ot move then I win because they cannot move to a legal position. The computer ends the games too early because they cannot be bothered to chase you around the board. You cannot unlock the higher difficulty games because it just says draw.',
       'Not 100% sure how that works but the other person has their king and it\'s a stale mate and I have practically most of my pieces but to unlock harder levels I have to win. Does stalemate not count? I think its pretty stupid' ,

      'I think that we should get more  coins for winning the levels. I find that the game can cost me money that I don\'t have, so I will spend less time playing your game. I love this game alot but why play if you are not getting enjoyment because it costs to much to play. (Otherwise I love the game) I also never got my horse, please give me my horse, I really need that horse btw. I already had a name for her to. I was going to call her daisy. The name goes great with the garden theme. (If you hadnt realized thst already) Please please send me daisy, I love her already. Peace.',
       'It was a lot of fun the first few "days" but got very hard very fast. Don\'t bother with power-ups as it doesn\'t really make a difference. The only way to win is to get lucky with a big bomb. That\'s it. It\'s a shame because the game is nice, I just progress way too slowly now for it to be worth playing.',
       'I enjoy playing this game but I think 900 coins is crazy for 5 extra lives. There are other games I play that offer less coins and a boost for a smaller price. On one game I play it\'s 65 coins for 10 extra moves and a boost, on a different one it\'s 25 coins for 5 extra moves. I also think that stars for each level should vary too. For harder levels it should be 3 stars, for medium levels it should be 2 stars, and for easy levels 1 star. I\'ll continue to play no matter what, it\'s fun, challenging and strategical!',
       'The first thing that comes to mind is that you guys have gone above and beyond on this one!! It\'s so much fun!! From the interactions of restoring the grounds, to decorating them (custom, might I add !!)    To the actual sounds the game makes while playing.. I can\'t stay off of it. And yes I\'m constantly tempted to purchase coins when I can\'t beat a level, for like the 7th time!!  Haha üòÇ Great game guys!! We would ALL appreciate more gifts than currently available. Especially for your daily addicts, üòÅ Forever a gamer.     Xx',
       'I rly enjoy this game the only 2 dwn falls it has.. is it only let\'s u spin the wheel every other day and when you get a free life.. it won\'t let you use it. It says ur lives are full. so you never get it also i wish it gave u more than 5 lives im on level 244',
       'Loving it.  Reached level 370, and am really enjoying the game. Fun, good graphics, good story. Nice balance of challenging levels and easier ones, but so far no levels that look impossible. On the negative side, 900 hard won coins for 5 extra moves is ridiculous. When replaying a level it would be nice if you could go straight to the game play without the screen telling you what you need, we already know.' ,

      'So I thought it was a good game to play pretty fun in the down time, but then I purchased the simple 40 gems pack and didn\'t receive my gems at all. I purchased a little person for the same price and it worked instantly. So I went to repurchase the gems in case it didn\'t process right ya know? And it said I couldn\'t purchase this item because I already own it. Like no I don\'t I don\'t have my gems at all. If you want future purchases I suggest this be fixed as soon as possible.',
       'It\'s a great game and a good time waster. The only problems that I have is that it takes forever to do any missions because you have and extreme limited food supply and money supply. To get either or you have to spend either actual money or it takes many hours to collect enough money to do even one part of a mission or enough food to do part of the mission. Other than that I enjoy the game it keeps me entertained for short periods of time',
       'Very fun game. Takes really long to accumulate coins coz they limit the buildings that produce them. Also DO NOT like how it\'s so Facebook oriented. For someone like me who doesn\'t have FB a lot of the bonuses and extras aren\'t available to me and I can\'t use my own picture or name.',
       'I  like this game, but it requires A LOT of purchases of the gem packages in order to progress. It takes a long time to make headway and the rewards are not enough to motivate the player. If you are impatient this is NOT a great game choice. If you are on a budget, also not a great choice! You can legitimately spend hundreds of dollars buying gems to make a tiny amout of progress. Warning, it is addictive and you will be tempted to buy the gems!!!',
       'While the game is fun, it\'s also a game to avoid. The developers are out to make money. If you spend real money to buy gems, you waste them because no prompt comes up before using them. Second, pop ups come up wanting you to spend $$ in buying packs and there is no prompts to warn you if you click on an pop up by accident and the developers refuse to give any refund. Beware if playing this game!!',
       'I downloaded this game because in the previews it showed different puzzles. (Ex. Coloring, actual puzzles)  but when i opened it up turns out it was just another click and wait game which I absolutely hate. I\'ve been playing it for a while now hoping the puzzle aspect of the game would show up later but nope have yet to find it. All I can say is false advertisement . Will update if anything changes. But that won\'t be for long time seeing as its a fricken click and wait game-,-' ,

      'Very fun and time killing. I play with my bf and 2 friends and we all try to beat eachothers high scores. It can be pretty competitive. Im prob gonna try to get more ppl to play with me too lol. There could be more variety in the blocks, and there should be like different modes, just an idea',
       'Its cool and all but needs some extra features.  Maybe a way to store 1 brick for later or some level advancement.  Maybe challenges or a power up system. The game is addictive but its very basic. with no real progression path,  other than beating your own high score, it becomes boring.  Still,  thanks for what it is.',
       'What they show on the preview and what it gives you in game don\'t even match. They make it look like it so easy. You cannot rotate the pieces. The pieces they give are so random, and most games you can barely get past a couple of turns before you can\'t place anymore and you lose.',
       'This is very deceiving. It looks like it\'s Tetris, but it\'s not. The pieces don\'t come down like the pictures show. I hate apps like this who deceive people to believe its a certain game when it\'s not just to get people to download. Will never download a game from this developer again.',
       'This app would score a lot better if there was an option to get rid of the adds. If gladly pay to have them gone but that isn\'t an option for some reason. They\'re so intrusive and far too frequent even for a free game. Uninstalling and won\'t be coming back',
       'This game says it has all different types of shapes but it has the same ones from another puzzle game. I think this game was very boring and that you should not download it' ,

      '**UPDATE** Was an awesome game. Could use a few more perks (ie. Weapons and hard to get items) in drop boxes and yellow zones.Now the down side is if you die in a level your last position is no longer there to try and recoup some of your items. Players killing you as you open trunks in inventory screen. With that I think I am done with this game. Oh ya and the free spin box...give random prizes instead of coins and rope. People will get really into it if perks are awesome.',
       'Honestly ive been waiting for close to 2 months. This game was like crack for me until the update left me no nice place, no hard earned stuff. I dont mind starting from the bottom again but at least give me some perks. This game is worth every cent and time. But until i get my account back or my stuff back im leaving 2 stars when really this game should be 5 stars all the time. I wont be playing this game til then. Thanks for the good times.',
       'I love the game. It\'s awesome. But I do have a few questions. Why are the bunker cards so extremely difficult to find? I\'ve been looking for days killing every zombie possible and looking through every crate without finding the cards. Also. Why isn\'t there a disclaimer that says if you die in the game, everything you purchased will be lost? I think that would be extremely necessary so no one over spends their money. Other than that, absolutely smooth running, fantastic graphics, and realistic deaths. I love every aspect except I can\'t find these darn bunker key cards.',
       'Great, addictive game! However, real fast, I was wondering how the free box worked. I always hope for something real good but ALWAYS end up with either raw materials or ONE coin. Now don\'t get me wrong, I LOVE getting free stuff, it just seems like the "spinner" purposefully chooses raw materials. Like, it\'s not random like it seems; it never chooses anything close to a weapon! In any case, I cannot play this game enough, very very fun!',
       'Absolute love the game and would\'ve gave a better review but version 1.7.6 and 1.7.7 won\'t work. It keeps saying "connection lost... It seems you lost connection to one of our game servers. Restart the game to proceed" over and over again ever since the 1.7.6 game update. If they fix it I will be updating my review to 5 stars because it is one of my favorite games',
       'FINALLY , I was able to complete my chopper. All the updates are very awesome. Well done Kefir! Just want to REPORT A BUG OR SOMETHING - when I went to a rest stop after the latest update. I can\'t seem to transfer the items from my chopper back to my inventory and to my surprise it all disappeared (bottles full of gasoline, 1 red ticket, 1 glock and a rifle) please fix this. Too bad i got 29 red tickets at the bunker. hahah but thats okay. Hope there will be some kind of reward to those non paying players. been with LDOE for 6months now.  THANKS!' ,

      'Horrendously intrusive advertising I play this game regularly, and enjoy the gameplay. However, the advertising is a horrible and annoying part of the app, and probably borderlining app guidelines. When the advertisement is on between rounds, they block your entire UI, and there\'s nothing you can do to shut it down. They will frequently stream video, which can easily consume your entire allowed data from your telephone company. This is NOT how you should provide games, free or not.',

      'I truly enjoy this game. There is a learning curve at the beginning if you\'re going to have a successful mission. However, soon enough you\'ll be traveling the Stars. This game is challenging enough to keep you interested. You are solely in control of all of your missions, which I like because I don\'t feel like I\'m forced to jump through hoops to get to the next level. Very well designed. Now for the real reason why I\'m sending this review... Designers, please move the engine ignition button away from the acceleration bar. Too many accidental engine ignitions while trying to adjust engine power.',
       'Awesome work with this new updates.  I have an idea. Maybe you\'ve already thought of it.  Multiple engines under the same fuel tank.  For instance, I\'m trying to reenact the Falcon Heavy, but because you can only put one engine under each fuel tank, I had to put several boosters to reach the required thrust/weight ratio.  If we could put multiple engines under a single fuel tank, I wouldn\'t need more boosters.  Maybe, something for the future.',
       'I replayed the game, and also thanks for replying on my other review, but I noticed a lack of, understanding. As I said, it\'s very realistic and challenging, and also that I would really like to be able to send pieces of a space station into space and connect them there, which I\'m happy with now that it\'s possible now. One thing I would really, really, really love and that would help many many people is a hands on tutorial. Like a demo mission(or multiple missions) that teaches how to play the game properly. It may be difficult, but it would just be awesome because me and many other people are hands on learners rather than visual learners. Keep up the good work!',
       'Seriously one of the best games I\'ve ever played. It\'s just so addictive.  However, I am currently working on trying to land a rocket on a platform in the earth\'s orbit and I find it almost impossible. Can you make something that let us target another rocket and calculates the transfer window for us (much like the target system for a planet that you currently have).  Would be nice if that can happen. Anyway, here\'s a five star for the great work!',
       'O.M.G. This is the most beautiful, awe inspiring app I have ever used. I feel like I am living out the history of space exploration! I did two sub-orbital shots, then orbital. I did the three orbits of Col Glenn... ran out of fuel! Aerobraked home after a total of 8 orbits. The coolest game ever! (One thing, I think there\'s a scale factor error somewhere. Orbit periods are about ten times to quick, given your stated velocity. Also mission report says you went to 15km when you went to 150km.)',
       'The creators could really make some improvements. For example i\'ve made a space station that can latch onto other ships, however I can\'t get any other ships close enough to latch on. We should be able to set other ships as targets so we can latch on or whatever. Also perhaps add wheels so people can build rovers that can land and travel on different planets. The gameplay is not too hard but not easy all you need to do is look at the tutorials and you are set and the graphics are good.' ,

      'Thx for updating Frozen Shadows. Blazing Sands still needs work. Too much water, not enough Sand. Needs a "slide," I recommend sand surfing. The canyons also get boring. The variations between it and the other levels don\'t compare, especially for the gem cost to play it. Still, fun and relaxing, and stays fun. 4/5.',
       'One of the worst games that I have seen. It takes so much time to load and then hangs in between( even after having enough RAM and Memory)  Downloaded this game and played for only 2 days and within 2 days deleted it. Wastage of time please d OK my download',
       'I have been.playing this game and won valentine and Chinese new year run but main problem is same glitches as in old temple run the score 24,000 suddenly becomes 4000 and then to open new map destinations you need 500 diamonds so it\'s quite glitchy and unrealistic',
       'This is worse than worst whenever I want to play this game it says that I have to download the content and it starts downloading this really takes too much time I really hate this app and I suggest you to not download it because downloading it is really a waste of time and your Ram because it is of too much storage which can harm your Ram and maybe hang your mobile',
       'Hi guys this game is very good because I like it means our brain it works very nicely and your brain will activate our concentration will improve very much I love I love with this game because Afreen activate that\'s why I love it and one more thing I want to say that we can concentrate in our like Bharatanatyam karate drawing studies and an extra thank you guys thank you',

      'Nice game with very good events but the drop rates to heroes of 5 star is too low i killed a lot of gems and scrols and hero orbs and my first 5 star i  dropped it at lvl 75. Okok now again event of summoning 100 scrolls and i continue still no 5 star hero only 4, just try and fix the drop rate. In the rest its a nice game.',
       'Wasn\'t sure about this game at first. I love it. I use a f2p  and a vip one  to see  the difference  between the two. Really well done. Having said all that the game does require patience. This is an IDLE game. You pick it up do dailies, talk, spend money, or what ever you want to do in game, then put it down to "farm gold,xp,mats". The high end heros do take some planning to aquire as a f2p player. This game requires patience because it\'s an IDLE game. Yes some people have a ton of money to throw at the game but don\'t be jealous, just play your game and have fun.',
       'Nice graphics, intuitive control, fun. In the beginning, it was a little too much going on for my ADHD self, but now I\'ve been playing for a couple months and it\'s my favorite mobile game of all time. I love collecting all the interesting heroes as well as saving for events and seeing what RNGsus  will bring next!  My only complaint right now is that their notification system is whack. Especially in the beginning, it\'s easy to miss things you can do.',
       'Too much pay to win, free players hardly getting anywhere in the events and so fourth, not fair, increase the rewards of spending money and give free players more too easily solved, I previously rated it 5 stars instantly loved it but as I\'ve progressed it\'s just not fair!! Please do something!! I am vip6 but I\'m not rich, please bring more rewards for loyal free users who watch the ads and everything!! Thank you!!',
       'Not what I expected, given that my first impression of it was of IH being an "annoying add". Once I decided to pick it up though my thoughts changed rather drastically.   It\'s simple, it\'s fun and the warm colour palette of the graphics make a nice change compared to the widespread use of bleak colours in other games.   If you think you might enjoy this game, you sure are my friend.',
       'I purchased the spring festival card on top of all the money I\'ve already dumped into this game and the devs didn\'t give me my in game rewards. I\'ve submitted numerous tickets to get a refund or my rewards and they just reply there is no problem. Ya no problem with you taking my money.  They deleted my review, wonder how many other people had this issue and had reviews deleted.' ,
    recentChanges: 
      '1. New Player Level Cap: 300.',

      'As a Scrabble purist I rather resent being able to reorganize the board whilst secretly enjoying getting high scoring squares randomly together. The app works well, only a micro improvement but I would ideally like a little more space between the bottom of the board & the playable letters, as if the area\'s crowded it\'s hard to see what\'s what at a glance. All in all great, thanks.',

       'Ive been playing the game for a long time and it\'s great. The only changes I\'d make would be to have the ability to resigned whether it\'s your turn or not...

      'I like this game. I purchased it because it deserves, also I want to remove ads. 3,50 ‚Ç¨ and ads are not removed completely. I\'m disappointed, expecially for the "restore purchase" button that not works. Despite this I think that as a game is fun but monotonous in the long run, defect of 90% of apps of this kind. I hope developers will add something with updates that are not other challenges that ofter go to luck (and waiting time should e removed also). Sometimes there are some bugs but irrilevant for gameplay. The development house has made other interesting apps too. Sorry for errors, is not my first language.',
       'Hi everyone!  I\'m really not a fan of this game, I mean it\'s ok I\'m not going to lie but is very boring. The graphics are ok but it is repetitive.

      'Ever wanted to be Mayor? Ever wanted to run a town, develop the land, and see a metropolis grow? Well, look no further than Animal Crossing cuz this game does none of those things. You just merge buildings into better buildings. It is fun, if you spend money so that you\'re not bombarded with ads. But then you run the risk of being unable to watch ads when you want to to do things like double your earnings or unlock a better building from the mystery box.',
       'I like merging games, but this one has a huge ad issue that makes the game somewhat frustraiting to play. I\'ll click the store to buy a house and it will auto start an ad video. It\'s lacking a bit in the story line department too. For a base merging game it\'s simple and fun, but definitely needs some work.',
       'Such a terrible money grab. Ads cinsta tly pop up, making a consistent method for progressing impossible (which was most likely the goal). Didn\'t have patience to get very far, I feel like I\'ve wasted my time in the 5 minutes I played. Greedy devs forcing quality content behind a paywall making the game virtually unplayable for free. Terrible job.',
       'When opening the game it loads fine Nd does its idle thing, but I can\'t tap on anything. Completely 100%unrespomsive. After multiple attempts. Will change rating if game becomes playable before I forget about this review.',
       'The game just gets exponantially harder without any sense of progression and the worst prestige system ever. Didn\'t mind spending 2$ to remove overextensive AD use. They try to sell you lvl ups for base chest that are useless. You still need 256 boxes for the next building and 512 for the next evolution. Still grinding? To bad now its 1024 boxes',
       'Too many useless ads! I don\'t like being forced to watch ads. Especially when they take up more of your time than gameplay. The game forced me to watch a 15 second ad just to open the store. UNINSTALL!!!' ,

       'It\'s a great game but I think you guys should open the classic Sonic event again and add classic eggman as his boss and maybe add more classic zones for classic Sonic (like Angel Island or something) plus make classic Sonics running style like his in generations his running style makes no sense... Classic isn\'t worth the 6 dollars the way it is...',

      'The heroes should be for all players from the lower level. They can make their own choice to choose the hero or switch them. If you provide the better or strongest hero for the strong one, it means the stronger is still the better and even the best. The weaker will have no choice,  but accepting the unfair attack from those strong ones. Please think about it again. Be fair for all players. Otherwise, the stronger or the best ones are still the stronger and the best ones. How about the weak ones? Do they have a chance to use their strategy? It\'s the strategy game, not for only the big or strong players. Thanks!!...',

But I have one request to Clash of clans creators that pls update clan castle of coc village that there would be an option that how much treasury do you want to Transfer to your storage. I think all coc players would be love this option and it would be great idea because you can transfer required amount of treasury to your storage and the rest of it will remains safe in clan Castel. If you like this idea and will work on it then pls reply me. I would be thankful to all Coc creators if that happens.. üòä',
       'NICE GAME, NICE GRAPHICS,NICE GAMEPLAY.. Been Playing Since 2015 and I See A Lot Of Changes..  I Wish new content would Be Added More Frequently and I HOPE The Village must Have Village Houses! Cause A Village Is Not A Village Wihout Houses SUPERCELL. There should be houses that has different colors and traits, some which raises stats of barbs and valks, or reduces time to produce troops and spells like in Builder Base,there should be houses which raises defense or offense and houses which reduces building production. This May Give Clash Of Clans A New Spark and Would Be More Strategic than usual. Thanks For Reading Devs Godbless.',
       'it\'s a good game and challenging. Strategy is needed on going through battles, Arranging your defenses is very tough to manage lol..... You want to keep away the enemies from your lawn though........ and I love the "Builder hall" when I\'m done on my "Town hall" I manage the second camp.... although the loot in Builder hall is limited it\'s fun and addictive a real time killer........ keep up the good work developers........ have a good day.... ^_¬§',
       '1. Make us know how many players are online and who are the players online                    2.

       'The game is wonderful. Love the control and everything but I personally think troop shouldn\'t be expended after a battle. It makes the game kinda frustrating. Loosing all your troops, not everyone can build troop up so fast. But aside from that. You guys did a great jobüòâ' ,

      'LOVE the things you\'ve added! I\'m over level 1000 so I expect the levels to kind of be repeated but it was getting boring. Now it\'s fun again! If there\'s not a match, we don\'t have to use the toy we chose for that game now (rocket, bomb etc) that is awesome! New toy chest with good prizes, not just rockets, when you get to 20. Thanks a lot! Maybe I\'ll even finish lol!',
       'This is one of the best games ever. It also has some adorable scenes and graphics. I only wish for one thing to be fixed. That would be that you could push on the map on the screen and scroll through all the levels and see the different scene titles. The map option isn\'t there now so you can still scroll through levels but you don\'t know what the names of each episode is.',
       'This could be a good game if there wasn\'t so much cheating during competitions within the game. Go up 900 levels in a few days the highest levels? The developers see nothing wrong with this. I think it\'s used by them to get us to spend $$$$. Oh well....too bad.',
       'Too much cheating going on in tournaments. I can\'t see how first place got over 400 stars in 4 hours and right when the tournament is about to end. And I\'m at level 748 That\'s not possible to move up that quickly. At this level it very difficult to move up so quickly even with coins and boosters.',
       'I wish i could give 0 star. I used to love this game more then anything else i am on level 868 and all my power ups/ boosters are gone ? What the hell. I save alot of them and you took all of them i hate it now i hate it soo much. Cheaters',
       'So much fun! I love thos game. My only gripe with the latest update is that I can no longer see the names of each area. Other than that, the game is magic! Can\'t wait to reach max level!' ,

VEarn points equals vac instead of like some of the others where it takes Toyo points to reach mac etc...Also, InstaII \'TOYOCASH\' App Enterr (TVCD) very reliable in paying you when you redeem to Bankk. You can choose assorted giftcards as payment or transfer to WaIet for cash. Your choice. I love these guys thanks for addingsome fun to my day.',
       'I just started playing this game and I don\'t think it\'s live matches. The opponents have ai style movements. I\'d like to play against other players in the matches. I\'ve been crushing the ai and want to try real people. But all in all it is very fun. Best badminton game I\'ve played yet. And most realistic too. I\'ve played badminton for about 15 years so it\'s nice to finally find a good badminton game.',
       'All of all the badminton game i\'ve played, this is the best. I love the graphic, the gameplay and all. But the rank, -50 when we lose is just too much. And the price of the equipment and ability is just too expensive. Especially because we only got like 12xp and 82$ when we win a game, its doesnt match with the those expensive things. So i hope you\'ll change something about this whole rank decreasing, the xp and the coins that we get if we win a game. Thank you :)',
       'decent minimalist animation, so game is smooth since u are against ai/bot. pretty much wont lose, when u have unlock all item and stats. need an update for tournament against real player. and additional moves or trick to create a bit complexity and thrill to the game. if u like something easy and relaxing this is the game.',
       'This game gives me life lol...just pure fun overall, please fix the multiplayer mode. It freezes every time we try to connect and play each other..and we cant connect through Bluetooth either',
       'Really addictive game. Can I give some idea?? 1. Player can choose a flag avatar from where come from 2. Just put some story campaign  Thats my idea. Hope can be better and better again. The last words is... really recommended game.  Regards from Probolinggo, indonesia.' ,

      'Am I missing something? It says relaxed game of 8 ball but all I get are table after table of balls laid out in patterns. I\'d really like to play a game of 8 ball and not just practice shots. The pics shown with the numbered balls with a POV perspective do not exist in the game. View is straight down on unnumbered balls.',
       'It\'s not horrible by any means but it\'s basically the children\'s version of what the game should be. Way to basic way too easy and no points and buying system or any sort of upgrades every level just diffs with amount of balls and placement not difficulty Thanks',
       'I played without sound for a long time. After Upgrading my tablet, the sound won\'t turn OFF!   I have it off in the settings but am still getting sound after sinking a shot and at the end of a game.  I am very dissappointed that i wont be able to play this app anymore.',
       'I enjoy playing this game. I already reach level 400 but i don\'t know how many levels this game have. Do you increase the levels every time you update this game until it reach to never ending levels so that no one will stop playing this game because of the never ending levels. This game is fun and challenging.',
       '1st there are ads in between each play which is ridiculous.. I dont know how high the game goes up but there are NO hints or instructions on what exactly the goal is besides potting balls.. it\'s ADDICTIVE and fun BUT if this is all there is to it I won\'t keep game long',

      'Game is fun. Dont even mind spending money in gens every now and again. But seriously to get the outcome you want, this app is charging waaaaaaay too many gems. Like 50 for one simple choice. And its goes up higher depending on the amount of gems you have. If I pay $5.99 for like 60 gems.. that should get me through and entire story. Not just one chapter. Will delete app if they dont change it. Not gonna spend $40 to finish a story.. Sorry but I think thats outrageous.',
       'The stories seem great so far, the app is really nice. But the limiting of how much you can "read" is way over the top. Two short chapters and then a 4 hour wait to get another two. Or buying more chapter tickets. All the actually fun choices are also gated behind premium currency. If it was even a bit less limiting, it would be great. As it is, its fun but annoying.',
       'This game is really fun! I wish there was a way to restart a story that you are in the middle of or that you could change your appearance or other people\'s appearence at any time. Also when you decide what your character is wearing, sometimes you can\'t see it because dialog is in the way. Also when you choose what you look like. I would prefer it to be against a white background. It\'s hard to see what the darker colors look like.',
       'Really fun, the animation style is adorable but the waiting time is killer! Two short chapters, then you have to wait a ridiculously long amount of time to be able to play more unless you pay. Also the best story options are only available through micro transactions to get more gems to unlock the ability to make certain choices',
       'I think this game is awesome, I would recommend it but not if you don\'t like waiting for tickets to be able to play it. Personally, I don\'t mind waiting and think the stories are totally worth it. I would like to have more free tickets and I think we shouldn\'t have to use diamonds. It\'s unfair to make us pay for the outcome we want- it\'s episode, we want to actually choose how the story goes! Also, you should be able to put glasses on characters without them looking like geeks. Overall tho, great game',
       'Enjoying this games app but the weaknesses is WAITING TIME for the passes to refill again. Not to forget, it require a lot of gems to choose fabulous dialogue i want. Last, If it does not include a REAL money, it will be more pleasure. I really enjoy this game to fill my freetime & looking forward to finish the story, so i really hope on later update, the passes will refill more quickly & there is no need for money maybe.' ,

      'I\'ll keep this short, this game was way better when players were able to buy things like the hearts (lives), small and large boosts 750m and 1500m, and other items like this. I have since started to play this again after getting a new phone and this game has changed a lot. Although I like the new power-ups, it wouldn\'t hurt to bring back the old ones as well, and by that I mean allow players to buy more lives, boosts etc.   I hope the developers can make this happen, although I\'m only one person so they will not listen and probably couldn\'t care less what I think, but listening to the customer (or player of your game in this case) would probably work out quite well.',
       'I love this game. It\'s pretty old, but amazingly, still one of the best games on a mobile device. It\'s unbelievably addicting, which is quite a problem.. üòÇ But I love this game so much, and I play it everyday. Keep it up, Halfbrick Studios! I\'ve been playing this game since I was about 5, so sorry for the late rate. üòÑ',
       'I love this game. It could be improved though, I think that during missions where you have to do a certain amount of something in one game (for example, ride 500m on the hog in one run, or collect 4 tokens in one game) there should something that tells you how much of that thing you have done during gameplay. This would be super helpful so you don\'t have to count yourself. Also to those who are complaining about ads, I simply turn off my WiFi when I am playing (this prevents ads) and I turn it back on to do the S.A.M challenge.',
       'Pretty good game. It\'s a really fun game to play, and a great killer time. But it has way too many ads. It also tells you to spend a lot of real life money, to the point that is ridiculous. Like, having to pay to be able to use a third slot. Really???',
       'This game has gone downhill since the last update! I\'m getting more and more "error occured" screens whenever I use the coin multiplier, the 3 chances to get 750 coins, and the 3 free spins. Plus, the game suffers from lag during gameplay. Not satisfied overall',
       'I remember when the game was new, you did not have to pay for as many things. Greedy developers, that\'s right milk it for all it\'s worth.' ,

      'good improvements, make more tracks and some challenges to do. also remove rocket bunny cars and make just rocket bunny parts, make more parts, last exhaust is curved but flame goes straight, let us tune engine by putting different parts, like intercooler and turbo, let us change tire graphics, also let us put different wheels on front and back. this game got very big potential, try to involve some multiplayer, with ghosts and rankings, or open multiplayer room for more users live. high graphic option need very powerfull phone, my nexus5 doing 10fps, on medium i got stable 30fps. after update i had to buy last track even when i buyed it before, save file keeps my cars but no track data. let us make layouta for parking track. thanks and thumbs up for you :)',
       'Its got great potential, the physics are pretty good and the game stops lagging if you put it on low graphics. The fact there is only one option for steering is upsetting as i would prefer tilt steering to be a bit more precise but all in all its a great start to something big',
       'I know I said that this game is one of the best but I\'m not so sure now. One of the reasons for that is that the buttons need to be customisable while playing the game because I can\'t seem to press the turn button at the right time because my thumb is not where I need it to be ( plus I need it to be bigger) and you guys have retracted the CR mode for purchasing Nissan GTR r35 and Ferrari 458 Italia as well as the Mercedes AMG c63 and the BMW M4 rocket. Bring back the CR mode for purchase of these vehicles. At least for the Nissan GTR r35 please',
       'Well... Ive bought all the cars that you can without gold... All you have to do is get to 50x and you will have around 120,000cr and thats enough to buy all the cars... And put what you want on it... Add more cars and add tuning, also remove the god damm machine gun exhaust not all drift cars do that... Fix it because its annoying and it also over powers the sound of the car...',
       'I love the game but there\'s a few things I don\'t like. The pause button doesn\'t actually pause the game. It\'s just brings up the menu to continue or go back to the menu. In first person view the textures are broken inside the car (blue grids everywhere) and some times the controls for going left and right become unresponsive for a split second. Not enough to do any damage but enough where I felt I should put it in my review. Once those things are fixed I will definitely give it a 5/5',
       'I love the game it\'s decent just the money that\'s hard to get... And there can be alot of improvements  Sounds of the cars Tracks  And I can\'t select my car that I have in my garage please fix this  Thank you üëå' ,

      'Such a Blast to Play. App never seems to grow boring like some other games. Also the apps not constantly hounding you to spend on Upgrades and Advances which is nice. Your character jumps higher, flips and twirls faster as U advance further. I play it once or twice a day at least. All in All a great/fun app....ENJOY !!',
       'Ads ads and more ads. And really pushy ads that you can\'t just close straight away too. You spend more time watching ads than playing the game, and honestly you can\'t advance in the game without watching ads for coins anyway, so it\'s basically an advertisement with a mini game in between. Scummy sell out app.',
       'Since the last update, being able to double up on coins from hourly balloons is impossible.  Also watching videos for coins isn\'t working.  This game is great when everything works right.  However, it is getting frustrating not being able to view videos for coins.  I\'m game ad breaks are still working, so what\'s the deal?  The # 1 thing that keeps me in a game is not having to spend real money.  I a star simply because of this.  Fix it please.',
       'In this game once you have all of the flips it gets really boring. Also there are way to many ad breaks. This game was really fun but now that it\'s newer it\'s boring. It lags to much and kicks me out. I give this 1 star',
       'This game is great but I would only rate it a five if there were less adds. Every game I play, as soon as I finished it said "add break". This is very annoying as the adds are up to 30 seconds long. Please get rid of them.',
       'The game desparately needs to offer more coins as skill level increases.  The frequency of coins remains the same while the skill level demands more and more coins (in the thousands).  Watching ads helps, but the player finds themselves doing that exclusively, which defeats the purpose of the game.  Physics, graphics and gameplay are good.' ,

      'Well,This Game Is Kinda Good.Im Gonna Rate It For 5 Stars In The First Place But It Changed My Mind After That. The Graphics Is Good,The Controls Are Good Too And Everything is really good. BUT THE ONLY PROBLEM it is very LAGGY. Maybe Next Time When You Make An Another Update,Make some improvemnts of not being laggy. PLS.',
       'This game is a dream come true!!!!! Firstly the controls are phenomenal, graphics are astonishing and techniquely... everything in this game is the best. Minecraft is already becoming stupid because of the high payments as they are the most creative crafting game. Well guess what? This is even more creative. Minecraft is just dumb. Art is good everything is good about minecraft but what gives for the price. While this app is the best and freee!!!',
       'Better than minecraft at crafting. No hp so no problem fall from high ground. If ure creative, this is a must have apps. Its abit slow to build, still better than minecraft mobile. Ive built a big croc and built inside its body houses.',
       'Lots of fun, creative and very easy!  Review update: I reinstalled in 2018 to find it has changed. You cant dig down very far like you could before, or down to water (it only floods a little bit in places) so I couldn\'t make a moat for the castle.',
       'This game is great, building is easy enough with the help of the system, and visiting other maps is a great feature. however for free players who just want to build, you would find that the available blocks are extremely limited. Other blocks cost 50gems (per block) and ~200 gems are already 4$.. Customizing avatar and villagers can go up to 10k gems since individual items are minimum 1k gems. Great game, if you\'re willing to go broke',
       'It\'s pretty cool I mean I like how you get to it like by all sorts of things and I\'ll tell you where you can place the blocks and it where the white cut-out boxes you can like click on it and it\'ll go through walls and you can just have a little bit of fun really cool thanks whoever built this thank you for allowing this game to be exactly like Minecraft and but it\'s like a whole little combined station of Minecraft and one of those block things I can\'t remember what it was one of those' ,

      'This is a very addictive game. I don\'t understand why people don\'t like it. Fast paced. As for the adds, you people should turn your internet off and play. It will help.. ##VOODOO## Would you accept a video from me? You can use it for advertising purposes. I thought it might be of great help for you.  Please get back to me by replying. I would be happy to email the video to you..',
       'I know a lot of people seem to not like this game but I actually really enjoy it the only thing I don\'t like is the lack of sound.   It would be nice if there was background music of some kind and a glass breaking sound effect when you went through each barrier something pleasing to the ears  Oh and shorter ads would also probably be good.  It could also use more roads and balls and barriers to work towards. I feel like this game has a lot of potential though hope it keeps being updated.',
       'The game is very enjoyable, and it\'s pleasing to the eyes. I like that you can fall off course and redeem yourself if you make it back within 5 seconds. The ads are pretty excessive though. I\'m all for supporting a free to play game with advertisements, and at first I didn\'t have a problem with the ads. You get an advertisement after every game but they\'re often just picture ads or skippable after 5 seconds. I draw the line when you go e me an ad after every game and there are 30 second ads that you\'re forced to watch. If you\'re going to make me watch an ad give me an ad every 3 to 5 games at least.',
       'Hey Developer! This is Great Job!. But, if there are other players who have the disease "Afraid of Heights", this game will not be suitable for him. You make players Cringe (Afraid), because there is no music. This game like a Dark Theme Games.',
       'It was hard to play but the commercials r the worst. I get that you have to have some to offer the game for free but every single commercial was 30 seconds long or more by the time u can hit the X. The commercials we longer then the game play',
       'Since I got this phone, no other app have I liked or disliked enough to write a review. This game is pretty fun actually. But after you play it a few times (they wait until you get hooked), they start showing a 30 second ad every time you fall off the map (the map is the same every time, but it is a very different game. It reminds me of flappy bird - you will die almost immiately at the beginning, but your skill will increase with repetition). So every 30 seconds, I got a 30 ad. And the game costs 3 bucks. Rip off. Zero star review.' ,

      'This game is perfect for anyone who loves magic, fantasy, collecting, and a whole new level of adorable! Dragonvale takes everything to the next level! I highly recommend it, as it is a amazing game, my most played, and I hope everyone else enjoys it just as much as I do. Five stars! üåüüåüüåüüåüüåü Edit 2: I was re-organizing my islands by Element the other day, and I had just finished the Plant Island. I put down a Oversized Oak Tree, and immediately, a image flashed through my mind: a young girl, sitting on a branch of the oak tree, a book in one hand, a baby Plant dragon sitting next to her. Stretched out in front of them was my Plant Island, the dragons freely soaring, the other islands in the distance. And that sparked a inspiration in my head. I just wanted to ask; can I write a Dragonvale book, which takes place at my park? Please let me know !  :)',
       'When I first had it it was super fun. Then I saw a game I wanted so I deleted it I did that before and got it back I could log into facebook and go to my old island. But this time I could not. I was so far and looking forward to seeimg my dragons but it did not let me go to my old island. It left me im tears that I had to do what I did all over again. So I deleted this stupid game and gave this. If I could rate 0 I would',
       'its ok, and you might think you cant li e without it, but trust me.... after a while year of playing, which is what i have waited to wrote this review, the game play becomes very repetitive. sure try it out, its fun, but not something for the rest of your life. dont put money into it, you will regret ir later.',
       'After Gardenias update i was good. Then yesterday 02/08/18 it wont even fully load up. It says it had trouble downloading a file. I tried the classic restart of device - didnt work. So I uninstalled and reinstalled the app. I can play through the tutorial on a new park but attempting to load my level 102 park I get the same download message. I play on android. Please fix this. I havent missed a day of play since you implemented the daily rewards.',
       'I love this game but all of a sudden this morning I can not start the game. It says it can not download a required file. I tried on two different devices and got that message on both. My game is level 73, so I have been playing for awhile and this is the first problem I have had. Please help!',
       'Amazing, however I wish there was a way to save you island. I had such a big and awesome set up, but when I got my new phone I couldn\'t get it back. Please fix this, use you Google account or something, but I hate having to keep redoing my island.' ,

ONE IMPROVEMENT could be that it dosen\'t take 3mins to load because I really want to get on this fricking amazing game but it is making me wait! I love the game it is really fun ‚ô°',
       'I love the game but needs just one tiny update, you need a create your own ride option, all out make your own vehicle and guns and gun damage, based on what you created it will tell u your damage and health,, also you need a user store to publish and use other users vehicles, you make cars semis bikes planes etc.but in order too get all these cool features, you need to beat the 3rd boss in the game. But I want a vehicle creator because I want too make a mark 2 version of Darkside from twisted metal, (seems fitting, right?) So plz, plz, PLZ, make a create your own car feature.',

Now I can\'t see an entire lane on either side when I play and my car is way off when dragging finger to either side as well.  Oh, and I can\'t see left portions of cut screens, either.

      'This game is very fun.  My only concern is when I level up my character I am supposed to receive my level up gift.  Multiple times it says I have received $1,000 cash or 5+ rockets, but when I look at my collected items it was not put into my collection.  This rating can easily be a 5 star but the fact that I am not receiving my level up rewards makes it a 3 star.  I hope it is just a flaw in the system, and that it is not a technique you are using to force me to buy gold bars.',
       'It\'s a great game. Easy to learn but hard to master. Obviously no money is needed but it definitely helps you move through the game faster. If you don\'t want to spend money, quit complaining and stop sucking. Just "fine tune your skills". Honestly my only complaint is consistency with the pumps and the speed it gives you and the up arrow sometimes seems like it didn\'t register but that could just be the calibration on my phone. But overall fun and challenging game. Download this for sure.',
       'It\'s a fun game, physics are good, but my good does it get hard. I have progressed only a few levels over the last week. Some levels you have to hit everything perfect. One little mistake and the whole race is lost.   Aside from that it seems very difficult to aquire gold which is required for some upgrades. This worries me that they are trying to force you to purchase gold, otherwise why would they even have that separate currency?  Both Mad Skills Motocross games are great, this game makes me concerned that Mad Skills Motocross 3 will be more pay to win.',
       'Good game in concept.. the problem I found is that you need to be quite exceptional with the controls to beat the computer opponents.. 1 mistake and you will have to start over as your opponent will just glide through the course with great speed! Needs to be more user friendly in my opinion.',
       'Ok so i see a reply from turborilla saying that they dont limit your play and can unlock everything for free but how are u supposed to get more gold which is used to upgrade speed for bikes which is the purchased currency? Other than that it\'s fun . Also if you say that watching trailers earns you free gold I wouldn\'t know because it gave me the wait for 4 hours to be able to get what you need to progress in the game.',
       'Awesome game to play, but bring back the SWIPE controls from the first game (atleast as an controls option). As it is frustrating when your idiotic manuals but you only want him to pump. MAKE THE MANUAL BUTTON SEPARATE TO THE PUMP.' ,

      'I used to love this game, very addictive but recent updates have made the game have too many elements (clubs - who cares???) Ads all over and money disappears quickly due to cost of each game.  Not easy to complete games it feels "fixed" with random cards plus drains the battery on my phone.  Uninstalled.',
       'This is my 3rd review. Love the game but had issues when ads were introduced. That was rectified, then had issues with new Android version. That was fixed and game was going fantastically for about 3 weeks and now they have reduced the amount of free treasure to $1000 instead of $5000. This means I need to come back 3x more often without playing a single game just to be able to play once.',
       'This game is fun, it is addicting. However because of the constant changing and the unfair advantages that some players get (not everyone has the same events, quests, or in game things) it\'s becoming less and less appealing. And the multiple device fix is a joke! EVERYONE had that advantage you they took it! Dumb!',
       'Originally I really liked this game BUT the further you go the  more it costs to play.  That was ok, but you add more and more ads in there, they are on the "boards" they are between the games, between the levels and NOW you have Tri Peaks Solitaire brought to you by, yet another game. I like it, as a game it\'s addictive and was  fun but I think I have had enough.  It\'s becoming not so much fun and headed for the uninstall list.',
       'I really liked playing as mindless entertainment despite what I consider to be unreasonable costs of the games as you advance in levels  and even tolerated the forced ads when they began. Unfortunately 2 days ago   it refused to load and continues to ask to retry or restart.  My connections are optimal and no updates pending.   Have tried to contact support to no avail. Disappointing.',
       'Love playing this game but I\'m getting sick of some of the levels feeling rigged. They can be impossible to win. And not just like, oh I didn\'t plan my strategy well enough. No. Like I will legitimately get NO useful cards in the entire deck and won\'t be able to clear ANYTHING. it\'s clearly fixed for us to spend money on it. Disappointing.' ,

      'This game was great until the most recent update now I dont play as much. Only being able to save 25 cupcakes when before tgere was no limit IS terrible! I\'ve purchased boost to pass a level & several times when I\'ve used them the game freezes so I lose the boost. I contacted customer service got a generic response & no refund but they want me to rate their service ü§î no thanks! I loved the game before but not so much now!!',
       'Would of gave full marks but on a few cooking appliances when I tap on it doesn\'t work. Second I think it would help if you could carry money over from one country to another and convert currency. Some of the levels are hard to achieve and you don\'t earn enough power ups and spoons to help you through the levels plus restore lives take ages. Customer waiting is to quick.',
       'Was a great,  fun game,  but now with the new Update things will not download.  I\'ve sent emails to them and nothing has change.  I did receive an email back asking to rate their and of course I told them you don\'t want me to rate something I never received!!  Can\'t open game,  this issue has gotten worse!!üò°',
       'I LOVE IT!!  Very addictive & challenging. My only problem is that I accidentally uninstalled it while removing games from my tablet that I no longer play. I had just reached level 50 so now I have to start all over again. Fortunately this is one game I don\'t mind doing that with!!',
       'Great for passing time and the graphics are pretty. Only thing I wish is that you would give us something to do with our coins. For example I\'ve maxed out all levels in New York, I have 71k coins there and nothing to do with them since everything is fully upgraded. Thoughts?',
       'I have one major issue. I cannot get Big Fish customer support to use the email I was to use. I have a second email that I don\'t use anymore but they insist on using it. On the second email, I am almost done with Bangkok. On my chosen email I have to restart in New York with nothing! None of my purchases, coins, levels, or achievements are synchronized, which are into the hundreds of thousands coins, almost all levels available, all achievements available, and a amount of money in each city! So very frustrating! Other than that it is a terrific game.' ,

      'I\'m 11 and i love it so much.I have some Ideas for a toca kitchen 3. You can be able to make sandwiches and soups or stews. And more ingredients, more people. And you could add mustard and mayonnaise. Wait Maybe you could make tacos and weird ones. These are just  suggestions but I would love to see some of these suggestions. You would call it Toca Kitchen 3, with a nice logo. I did like toca kitchen 1 & 2. It is fun to play and food, and when we mess up to see how the people eating the food react. Bye.',
       'Awesome! You Can choose your pick. I am only using 9 and I love this. It is really interesting what they like and what they dislike. Thanks for making this , Toca Boca! I\'m sure 7 year olds would be giggling with laughter. Keep up the good work! Best regards, -Bella on MSP',

Keep up the good work! And make sure to make more today games free! Because then everyone will love you!',
       'I\'m giving a 5 star rating, not cuz I like this game but because I want you to make all your games free or at least the toca life:city or vacation. Please I always wanted that game because It looks really fun and it must be. You probably won\'t make them free but if you can, make toca life city free at least',
       'This is the best game ever it is also funny because I was giving the girl food and I gave her some strawberries and I put a lot of lemon, hot sauce, Barbiecu sauce,Manas,keckup,salt, and pepper... SO funny, it also sounds just like a kid is playing with the food, that I\'m eating grapes right now,üòÇüòÇüòÇüòÇüòÅüòÄüòä‚ò∫üôÇüòê',
       'I want YOU to read this Toca Boca I love it! But I have to ask, Why is there bread if you can\'t make a sandwich? Also can you make there a way to make soup? I really like your games but I am only 10,how do you expect me to pay for the games. At make 5 free like this!' ,

      'I really liked the action scene where the ICE police arrested the mommy and took her children into social services. I do believe giving an emergency C-section for an illegal is a bit much for a story line, but whatever. Totally makes sense. I love how we\'re able to take care of the premies and foster them until they\'re adopted! 6/10 - Would play again if bored.',
       'Well when I every part was doing just fine but then when I put all the things and it had something point when I posted it didn\'t work so I deleted it I did at first give it a good rating but now I want to change my reading and that\'s why I\'m doing this I said who did it all through my reviews so I hope every everyday everybody out there don\'t waste your time playing this gameüòêüòêüòêüòêüòêüòêüòëüòëüòëüòë',
       'It sucked the mother getting arrested we having to take care of it is all a lie and it was like the worst game ever it could take you four minutes to play literally',
       'This game\'s control quality is terrible and I even started to get frustrated because the game wouldn\'t let me do something I needed to do to advance.',
       'This game is boringgggg you barely have anything to do and the mommy does not go to jail for child pretectant services the people that commented just lied for people to download it!!!',
       'This game is good I liked it also not so many adds are there  and the part I like the most is that the dressing of the babies.if looking for a game like this please download it. Thanks' ,

      'I think that you should win the balls all so instead of just trophies!! You pay so much money to qualify for a tournament and you got to pay a 10,000 dollar entry fee and then 1000 ever hole!! The game is coming to how much you can spend instead of how good you are you shouldn\'t be able to enter a rookie tournament if you have over a thousand trophies!! Maybe it shouldn\'t cost so much to be able to get into the tournament!!! Besides if you spend a lot of money the people who can\'t spend as much!! I enjoy this game a lot I play it all the time I believe that it should be cheaper to qualify for the tournament!! And when you lose your game that you should loose the ball your playing with!! I really appreciate your time in listening to my opinion!! Hopefully this might make it a little more fair to the people who can\'t spend the money they would like!! Sincerely a Huge fan of the game!!! Thanks Joseph',
       'This is a great game but it has it\'s draw backs. Due to a glitch in the game I had some coins and trophies taken from me in a game that never loaded. The biggest issue with this game is there is no offline solo play. A solo or practice mode would be great to allow people to get a feel for the game and be able to make tweaks in certain scenarios when playing with others. Easily worth 5+ stars if some adjustments can be made. Very addictive, very fun and suspenseful, and a great time killer.',
       'I like the game. But you repeatedly match me with players that are much better. I dont get a fair chance. You do this every time i get trophies & coins, & you keep it up till all trophies & coins are gone. All i am asking for is fair matchup. I also dont know how you can justify a person with just 12 games having 120 trophies, it has happened on several occasions.',
       'Game is based on luck. Could be so much better if it was more realistic ie club selection. How can it be fair when it is easier to chip in from off the green than it is to hole a putt? NEED TO FIX BUG THAT MAKES MY SHOT HAPPEN WITHOUT MY FINGER LEAVING TABLET SCREEN!!! HAS COST ME HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF COINS!!!',
       'Awesome game. The only thing I don\'t care for is, why am I playing people that have 80 trophies but have played 2,000 games? I mean I\'m working with starter clubs and they are playing me with so much better clubs.. I just don\'t think that\'s very fare. And is there any other way possible to receive extra gems and coins or get extra clubs higher-ranking clubs? Thank you for your time and thank you for coming out with this game it is awesome',
       'Game seems fine as long as you DO NOT BUY ANYTHING!!. Game is so rigged and its about the most obvious Ive ever seen. Just before tourney time, you will not make a shot and you will be reduced to ZERO coins, balls and trophies. I have over 10,000 matches so I know the game and support very well. DO NOT BUY BALLS, COINS HEARTS OR ANYTHING ELSE FROM PLAYDEMIC.' ,

      'Good game however, once you\'ve taken control of all the islands there is little else to keep you interested. I would look at adding more world\'s and making the trading a real economy by having the ability to buy items and sell them for a profit in different ports. Potentially even have your ports taken over again or mutiny so you need to recapture them.',
       'Overall the game is great. Gameplay is smooth but slow (hey, old ships), making the gameplay calming. Graphics are pleasing to the eyes, though it could still need improvements. Sounds are calming too.   You guys should change the image for the gold coins since it resembles a symbol in One Piece. And also the whale movement could be smoother and slower. You could add more creatures in the ocean in addition to the whale since its just blank at times.',
       'Very simple. Gives me a lot of nostalgia. Two things though, it seriously needs music maybe some Celtic tunes or shanties. And secondly it needs more stuff to do. When I first saw a whale I was excited about doing some whaling but nope. The whales do absolutely nothing. Maybe even some treasure hunting puzzles or something. Good game just needs a little more content.',
       'Awesome game! Two things: please do something about the controls, they feel very poor quality. Even addig a left and a right arrow would be more comfortable for me.. Second is content. This game is huuuuge. But I\'m so addicted I managed to conquer all the islands by now, so I really want more challenges. Thanks for the awesome game, keep up the good work!',
       'Amazing game, graphics, and animations. My one wish is for an actual circle pad for movement because I have quite large fingers and I can\'t see what I\'m doing/ what\'s going on. Also would like maybe different routes to go on with boats: better damage but lower turning, faster but less health etc...',
       'This game together with Clash Of Clans are the best games I have ever played. It\'s addictive and fun but there\'s a lack of content. I completed the game and I don\'t know what to do now. I would really love it have my progress saved in the cloud and have more content added to the game. This game has perennial!' ,

       'This has to be like, my 5th or 6th reinstallment of this game since there\'s no ingame reset, but darn well worth the data(little bytes). I usually like more realistic car games, but even the "extreme" warp in physics in the gameplay doesn\'t distract from the fun. These are the cars you\'d want if you\'re trying to beat the traffic, run from the cops, or solve a parking dillemma. Great fun time killer! One thing though, the other reviewers are correct in their complaints about how often and when ads pop up. That shouldn\'t happen smack dab in the middle of a maneuver.',

Most troubling issue is that after I spent $119.99 for 200,000 points I believed I would be able to purchase all vehicles and packs in this App and developer\'s other iterations of this same type of App. Turns out I wasn\'t able to purchase all vehicles in this App but couldn\'t use my points across developer\'s other racing App\'s. Now I\'m stuck with 185,000 points and pretty much out $100.00 does not make me happy at all. I would like this developer to contact me somehow as I don\'t have contact info. Thanks',

      'I really love this game. I love voting and seeing what other have also come up with. I love that it is really world design where you can actually shop for pieces and not cartoon rubbish. However, I have had a number of issues where the game has had to restart and have even lost diamonds and cash after trying to collecting daily rewards when it re starts, watching endless adds and not receiving rewards for them or downloading other useless games I have no interest in and actually playing them to generate rewards and not receiving them either. These are my only issues with the game. Other than these it would be five stars.',
       'I love this game!! "it helps a lot" with my shopping addiction because I feel like I\'m buying real merchandise. I really enjoy the updates and how you guys added more room to be designed!!!! Also the 2d & 3d option to view products is awesome!! and if your  studying for interior design this is the app for you! I love the voting of others designs, you get to view everyone creativity. I really love how you guys never ask for an rating....like some apps by the 1st go you get popups please rate our app you guys never asked for an rating I choose to. Thanks for getting me addicted :))',
       'I thoroughly enjoy playing this game.  It\'s well made and no technical issues. 2 problems I have is 1) you can\'t sort the items by price and 2) and this one is a big one you can only use an item you purchase 5 times.  That\'s it.  I bought more diamonds so I could purchase more inventory so if you\'re taking my real cash you should let me keep the item in my inventory.  That really turned me off so I definitely will not be purchasing any more diamonds until that changes.',
       'It absolutely amazes me. You can\'t play this game without spending money, but the whole thing is an ad for furniture companies. They get to showcase there new items (with of course brand name and "price" attached) everytime you play. They are double dipping on there profits and it\'s unfair to thier players',
       'Love this game.  It doesn\'t pressure you to rate but after playing about 6 months I still enjoy designing.  A couple tech issues with diamond offers but I\'m still playing everyday and love every second of it.  I wish their were more rooms but i think it is a good amount (about 6/day) to keep you engaged throughout the day and discover new ideas.  Thanks, truely a 5 star game.',
       'I love this game, though I agree with previous reviews regarding rooms that don\'t include the aspects requested for the design challenge. The voting also seems flawed when rooms that are similar to top voted rooms get really low votes and winning rooms include those previously mentioned that have little of the challenge in their design or are really similar. There\'s little information about how the voting works in terms of who\'s designs are up against another players. The daily rewards could maybe reflect more reasonable amounts considering how much everything costs.' ,

       'Game is getting better with being fair. Free to play people can actually roll decent heroes after a while with persistence. IGG is still unbelievably money hungry for their newest released things - but I guess it\'s better to wait for everything or pay for it upfront. I chose option 1. Thank you IGG for making rolling a little more fair.',
       'I\'ve played for 3 years and this game has just gone way downhill, this is the biggest pay to win game that exists. It\'s enjoyable to see people have the ability to buy what I worked so hard during the last 3 years for a mere $10. I haven\'t enjoyed this game in months, it\'s a chore to still play.

       'nice game for the others saying that this is a copy of coc it has a lot of difference this game is more easy to play than coc. coc is a hard game more time o upgrade more time on things in this in only 5 m its fast becouse it is free and you already have a hero if you start the game in coc you ned to be th lvl 7 to get it or 8 idk but dont say that coc an cc is the same becouse your wrong of saying that they are the same (^_^)',

      'The ghosts costumes. They become turkeys  when Pacman eats an energizer.  Getting buggy. Constantly ignores commands.. No matter what difficulty rating.  Game should be harder, not hard to control. Ghosts could be faster or  not turn blue so long... The controls kinda suck.',
       'This game is great, but the controls suck. It always gets stuck and goes the opposite direction. Also, I expected ads but it\'s ridiculous that they automatically pause my game and pop up. Most of the time, I accidentally click the ads and it exits the app because the ads are so unexpected.',
       'controls keep laggin its hard to change directions and the ads make the game intolerable!!! Also I win sometimes in challenges like today the love maze but I didn\'t get any coins! i was supposed to get the highest reward but no! why? coz game is shite',
       'They have added so much junk to this arcade classic, that it\'s virtually unplayable. I just wanted to play some classic pac-man, not do daily missions and challenges. This is not Pac-Man, this is like Pac-Man Reborn or something.',
       'It is a great distraction. I play knowing that I can be completely taken away from me having to deal with boredom or anxiety. In life it really plays a big role in the scheme of things. People probably think that I am texting someone. Makes it kind of like a very good thing to appreciate.',
       'In think this game is still pretty good. Yeah, sure its got those daily challenges and stuff, but you know its fine with me. You still get to play the classic mode, and still get a better variety of maps to play on! Also, BANDAI NAMCO Entertainment America Inc. I love your game! I really do! Would you give me a special response please! I\'m a big fan my whole family is! Well good job on the game! Live Long, Love the Classics!' ,

       'Used to be a fun game but unfortunately it no longer works. Game has you waste your coins on quests which you complete and then you receive no reward for some reason. You\'re supposed to get free coins but about half the time you don\'t actually get it after you click the button. I wasted 90 coins and complete a quest and then I received nothing but it clearly thinks I completed the quest because I need to pay another 90 coins to get a new Quest. This is happen like half the time! Sometimes I get no XP for some reason. I don\'t know what happened to this game',
       'What is this???? After every 1 or 2 game when the main menu comes I touch screen just frozes I can\'t even touch any button. Neither I can play nor I can go to shop it\'s nothing I can do but just to quit the game. My phone is Samsung S6  Pls do something it\'s really irritating',
       'This is a nice idea for a game but needs a lot of work. First of i couldn\'t even understand how the game works. Always saying "connection is slow" every damn time. Controls? Terrible. Before i even learn how to move i get eaten. Please look into these and you might have a good game there.',
       'fix the laaags please. I have high speed internet but still facing lags. I spent a lot in this game and don\'t want to loose it. Still lagging :(. It works with only high speed internet. Can\'t play with the data packages only strong wifi.  You didn\'t fix this in the new edition of the game and the rush mode is not working. The new party is sucks big time. Fix fix fix',
       'Over all great game, but there\'s just one problem. The problem is that when you get huge (35k mass or higher) it tends to lag and freezes then eventually the app crashes please fix it really annoying .. Edit : There seems to be a bug in the controls shooting food will split tf' ,

      'Developers, please read.  First, this is a fun game and I enjoy its play style. It\'s reminiscent of TV shows like Battles Bots and game series\' like Bot Arena.   Second, I would like to suggest giving players the ability to add, delete, and move weapon, utility, and wheel anchors. In the same way players can currently add enhancements to parts and chassis\'s and move around stickers.   Third, It would be appreciated if Quick Play Super Boxes replaced Regular Boxes after all shipment slots are full. It would provide a greater incentive to keep playing Quick Play beyond just Winning Streak Crown Rewards.  I\'m offering these suggestions because I really enjoy this game and would like to see it become a more fulfilling and personalized experience.  Thank you,',
       'I absolutely love this game. I spend a lot of time on it! It\'s fairly balanced between players who play for free and those who purchase gems to give their bots better stats. You can easily rank up without paying a dime. I did for so long, until I kept hoarding pieces and didn\'t want to sell. I began to use gems instead of coins.',
       'Hi there Admin.  The cash purchased Super Giant Box has just crushed on me while I was opening it. I think much of its content is still out there instead on my account.  Would you be so kind and check the status of this cash purchased Super Giant Box?  Best regards,  C',
       'Game it self is great and a ton of fun.   But, the system for showing ads is so annoying.  It\'s not just your normal video ad no, they make you watch 3 different ads and a min of 16 or 11 sec each.  After you have watched the minimum time, you have to hit next and repeat again',
       'Wasted up to 200gems in ultimate league so far. When you lose a match, they offer you to keep your progression in exchange of gems, but they put the option on the right side instead of left. I keep pressing it by mistake and waste gems that I\'d much rather use to reset gang fights instead.',
       'That stupid balloon weapon has killed and ruined the game for me. Also, supply boxes have gone rubbish recently. Getting the same old rubbish which is always alot less powerful than current level. Not had a decent tank in ages. Was a good game, not anymore.' ,

       'I think if you could add a few extra spaces for more ninja then everybody would be happy .the reason I\'m giving this app a 4 star rating is because you can only have up to five ninja on a mission including your own .if anybody would like that to happen then give this review a thumbs up.',
       'It\'s amazing I love it I like how you can make your own ninja and have any weapons it\'s one of the best games I\'ve ever played I have it on all my devices it always puts my in a good mood a job well done plus I\'ve saw every episode and the movie I\'m a huge fan got lots of the sets (5) stars keep it up',

      'It\'s gonna be better if you can do any useful upgrades or some useful items to help with flights. And do come out with a solution regarding zooming out and in. The missiles sometimes come out of the side of the screen too suddenly and we can\'t see and react to them. Maybe the screen should be zoomed to the part where the players can react to the missiles from side screen. Other than that, nice game.',
       'The game concept is amazing and the motion of play is good too. However its as if the creators are trying on purpose to make this game a flop. The controls are absolutly rubbish and honestly make no sense. The plane makes unwanted sudden turns. This coulb be simply avoided and simplified by a joystick control.i shall review my rating once the game gets an update improving the controls',
       'Ok so, I really enjoyed this game so I decided to pay in order to remove the ads... Turns out the ads are still poping up and of course there is no way I can contact them about this issue. Just a bunch of thieves.',
       'I played a few rounds, decided it was a great time killer but it has too many ads. Paid for no ads, still have ads. Update: emailed the developer, have not recived an answer, and STILL have ads. Next is an email to Google play, if they don\'t do anything I\'ll be contesting the charge with my bank.',
       'It\'s just a constructive criticism. Now to be honest. I Uninstalled it within 10 minutes.  I know you need to earn money but you know greed is bad ALWAYS.  Too much ads every single time.  And touch controls also lil weak. Just so annoying.  Better luck next time.',

      'Once you start you can\'t stop. Edit. After 3 years am still addicted to it. But the feb 2018 update is asking too many questions and end of game. Retry button should come back. The hard levels are really hard. Can\'t get through even after 20 attempts',
       'After the last update I have been stuck on a hard level for to days. I like a challenge but this is ridiculous.     I notice that now the game blocks and will not allow you to use the special powers that you earned at the bottom. Also I tried to use my chocolate bars to get more chances it directed me to the store to buy more even thou I already had 46 bars which was enough to buy more moves. Until this is fixed I am going to play other games. I will not buy more bars.',
       'It cost to much money to just keep playing and then you earn stars but have to pay to break open the bank... not a fan of that it\'s kinda really crappy to give hope that you can eat stuff but then it\'s hope gotta fork over hard earned money still even though you earned stars',
       'It\'s a great game to pass time, but I hate the fact that when you loose a level it makes you confirm that you want to give up. When you accidentally hit continue, it automatically take your gold bars. You should have to confirm that aslo....',
       'This is by far my favourite in the Candy Crush series.  But one thing I still despise... the way my gold bars are held hostage in that piggy bank.  I won them fair and square in game.  I don\'t see why I have to buy with real money, something I earned in the game. If y\'all could just quit with that dang piggy bank, you\'d have one mega happy player. Just sayin.  That piggy annoys me.  Just sayin.',
       'I guess you don\'t read what your players write about your game. The update is BAD. Time consuming and unfriendly.  You still han not addressed the issues of players using foul language as their playing name.   I am thinking about getting deleting this app. If you didn\'t want it to be free why offer it as if it was?  There are issues I wish to address.  One issue is that you have allowed players to you swear words as their player name. Please remove this player from my online list that appears on my phone. I find this totally inappropriate. I am supprised you allow this. I play to get away from people who do this type of thing.  Second issue is that you have not fixed my off line play option.  I still have to go on line to open and play the game. This is my second request. Please fix this. Maybe this is my mistake in thinking it had the off line play option.   Thank you for the game play.' ,

      'Whenever you die in the game you start completely over again. And after each game an advertisement plays. Wish there could a 5 second skip button like YouTube does, especially you guys advertise every time after you die/end a game.  The graphics are cool, love the neon colors. It\'s a game for all ages!!! My kids and my husband and I all play this game. It\'s very competitive!!! I swear my husband can\'t beat my score no one has lol',
       'It is soooooo addictive and also VERY awesome. The only problem is that because people go on the game on their phone\'s or tablets I find it hard to control I don\'t know if anyone else thinks so but that\'s my opinion. Pls no hate anyway, Peace out and the reason it is like slither.io is bc it is by the same company',
       'It\'s good but not what I would play on daily basis..... it\'s my opinion so don\'t get mad. The controls are OKAY and I think they add more stuff to the game, I don\'t have any ideas for it though. This game is great and in the people like it but for me I wouldn\'t play it all the time on a road trip. Keep up the good work though! üòÄüòÄüòÄ',
       'Great game can be addictive with no real goal but to eat others poop as me and my daughter call it and other worms to grow bigger. Top notch comical game EVER that you wont be able to stop. Only set back is that the game gets extremely extremelylaggy on addroid tablets and on the online game interface',
       'start to crash often when playing online. i think it need some sounds or music. playing silent for long time feels like going stupid after long time played. since it so addictive . keep repeating boring play but keeps ppl playing. is fun though, but I think everyone need to keep control how much time played. can\'t believe I can play for like hours haha. don\'t know why my Nick name don\'t show anymore. usually is \'eat uuu\'. but shows as nothing ____ now.',
       'Worst game played ever . Too irritating , so many adds . Very disappointed . I was just seeing the ratings and I thought it will be good but after that I got very much angry. PLEASE NEVER DOWNLOAD THIS GAME. Slither.io is much better game than this one. Worst game controls' ,

      'I played it a long time ago and i stopted like 5 months ago. Then now i reinstalled it and:  1. I could not enter my acc  2. I could not connect to facebook or google play.  3. I had to pay each time i danced wich sucks.  Till that update this game was the best game/app ever. It was so fun and so great that I just wanted to play nonstop.  I mean before this big update u payed for a song and u could dance on it as much as you liked. Now it just ain\'t fun anymore.   Please return to the classic game or your gonna lose much much more players like me.',
       'I like it, I use it to exercise and have fun with my sister. Only question I have is: How accurate is the kcal Burned counter? I played for over an hour and I am told I burnt 1,252 KCals. I question the accuracy of this. You update the game often, so can you put in the game somewhere the average calories the song the user is choosing to play burns? That is my biggest concern. Otherwise, no issues. Fun, easy to use. Great way to get exercise in all the while enjoying it with family and friends.',
       'Game is good as all just dance video games. Daughter enjoyed it until noticed that she had only a few dances then had to wait. There should be at least a shorter time to wait. Or some sort of option to earn more coins. Because 2 videos weren\'t enough. And one of them didn\'t work because the connection was lost. Again game was okay as for game play. But not sure its a keeper.',
       'It\'s fun to do and this game is perfect for me because I love to dance. Dancing is my favorite thing to go when I\'m bored. I love the songs and dance moves it\'s awesome to play and do. Thx for making this game cause now I can do more dancing and dance moves. You guys should download this game for you new people cause it\'s awesome to learn but in a fun way. So if you suck and don\'t know how to dance then you should download this game it\'s perfect for you if you want to know how to do simple but hard dancing moves.',
       'Honestly, the game is great. It loads good, has amazing graphics and is easy to play. However the credits situation is absolutely retarded. I feel as if we shouldn\'t have to wait twenty-four hours to play ONE dance then wait again or pay $2.99 per DAY just to dance. You should at least have a page of good free dances for when someone has nothing to do!',
       'I really enjoyed playing this... Or at least the two songs I was able to play based on the coins that I had. My only criticism so far is that there should be ways to earn coins other than waiting so long for refills, watching ads, or buying coins. This strict control on earning coins doesn\'t make this a great game to play with a group of friends (though I know that you can buy VIP passes which are valid for a limited amount of time). It would add to the game play (as well as the overall experience of the game) if coins could be earned during the game in power ups or when you get perfect scores. This would give incentive to keep playing, let the games potentially last longer, and add to the competitiveness between players to enhance gaming fun.' ,

I think i speak for many people when i say that boys and girls should have more hair options from the opposite sex, for starcoins, as some people may take offense if they are strictly only allowed "boys hair"/ "girls hair" unlsss they are paying for it. I think you could inmprove further by making it easier to earn starcoins and another way to earn diamonds because many people do not want to/ cannot afford to BUY items in a fictional world.. Overall, i think this is a well rounded game, with a few improvement points, however i enjoy being able to have my own unique style in a virtual world :)',
       'Its a fun game however there are hackers,scammers ,glitches and its really annoying when the game freezes. Also when people post art books they can be really inappropriate. I think you should be at least  13 to play this game because of the inappropriate art books. I think the new update is great but I would like it if we would make n buy wish list on tablet and  on phone. Its a fun game but you reply need to think about who you can trust because many people just ply with your feelings.',
       'Can I request you have a different way of changing your password? My reason is because I got hacked and my email address is not working on it! Overall a great game but please change how you change password to make it easier! For the people who don\'t know their email I am there for you!',
       'This game is very boring! And why do the avatar have big head! Please fix this game not to be disrespectful but its really discussing when they try to ask for your password I hate to and can make the avatars 3D',
       'I just have one little problem with this game. The nose on my avatar keeps glitching out and it\'s really annoying. If you guys could fix it, that would be great! ‚ô°‚ô°‚ô°' ,

      'Pro: Its a pretty challenging game but not to put your out. There is also some daily chanllenges, new revamped arena to do with also some clan battle. The new room system that brings makes some level design unique. Some variety in levels and pigs. A new bird introduced: Silver The fortune tower   Cons: The lives system. Doesn\'t have that much of a story. Silvers ability is kinda disapointing.',
       'The game is very nice.Pls do some minor bug fixes . When will the NFL hat sets will be for sale by using black pearls. Please fix the tower of fortune as the pig never allows to go above 2nd floor and it appears on any card I pick after that. Fix these issues. A very nice game.',
       'Great game, but honestly they need to tweak the chests for in app purchases. Why are the things not all even? I should be able to get the same level of item. If I spend 80 jewels, all the items should be equivalent. There should 3,500 feathers on the same page as 7,500 feathers. If I\'m level 300, even the common chests could reflect that. People will spend the money. Why not offer all the daily specials all the time? It\'s fun, but I spend cash money on this game, let\'s make it worthwhile...',
       'Game is fun. I\'m giving it 1star because I can\'t turn off the notifications. Just turns back on and bothers me at all hours. Oh, and the stupid debris flying through stupid tunnels over and over and you can\'t progress until the debris breaks and it never will and wastes your gems.  AND the game won\'t connect to other wifi sources. Just your home so if your away you can\'t get daily rewards or play the arena.',
       'It dosentt work at all since last update 2 weeks ago,   I\'ve tried re-installing it on my Samsung galaxy s3 and my tablet..    It is still completely useless on both devices.    rovio needs to be better than this to its paying customers...  It is ignorant as a company to not even try to fix this problem. I know I\'m not the only one that continues to have this problem.',
       'Game is great for the first several days, then gets so ridiculous that it no longer is fun. I\'m assuming that\'s when they want you to start dropping your hard earned money to keep up... My problem with that is: either you have ads that provide your revenue, or you have a pay-to-play game. In the end, it\'s just every other angry birds game.' ,

      'This game is very nice and the best game I have ever played. If you have a chance to download this game dont let this chance to pass by. I prefer you to download this game. In this game you have a small place to decorate but there is more place which you have to buy. There is a guide in this game called Ernie who has the most beautiful town ever. You can visit his town any time you like and also make friends with anyone else. Me and my all sisters ( I dont have a brother )play this all day long and have much fun. This is the best game ever.',
       'The VERY best game EVER..so fast to level up... Never boring.. Always SO much to do!!! ... it NEVER asks 4 money !!!!!!   NO pop ups or commercials. !!!. . the inventors are genius... i Love this game..  thank you for making this game.. Graphics are Amazing!!!

Township friends make it SO much easier n fast 4 everyone  .. and so much more You just HAVE TO Try TOWNSHIP ‚ù£üíû',
       'RSYFJH Great game very addictive, and I don\'t know if I just found the right Co-op or what but the team work on this game is amazing. I love my little town although, üòí you need to be able to expand faster! I have NO ROOM for any more buildings, and they want me to expand my population so I can add more buildings. Thats\'s kind of ridiculous. That\'s the only bad thing I have to say about this game.',
       'I love this game. Amazing sound effects, graphics. You guys did a great job that\'s for sure! But still couldn\'t give it a five star because of the lastest update. The entire screen goes black after playing the game for 5-6 minutes. That\'s pretty irritating not to mention how much slower the phone gets as well. Didn\'t have these issues with the last update. Fix it please!',
       'This game is sooooo addictive,  it\'s like 4get cooking,  cleaning once you start it\'s hard to stop lol.  Lots of fun races,  prizes,  co-ops to help each other & make friends and have a great time.  But be forwarned this game can cause you to lose track of time.  Oh I will play for couple hours & next thing you know it\'s 1 am lol.  Hmmm few more mins bam it\'s 4 am.',
       'I love this game! It is very addicting. The details and graphics are outstanding. The only thing I don\'t like is how long  it takes to accumulate coins and cash, the videos to earn coins and cash are glitchy most of the time and don\'t work. The factories are expensive once you get to higher levels and are hard to buy due to how many coins it cost. Overall, this is one of my favorite games hands down!' ,

       'This is a really fun game but my  my concerns are that when I have no balls left, for me it doesn\'t have the option to play a video to earn more but for my brother it does therefore it makes me start all over again. The other concern is that when I use a bomb for the chest it takes away a ball for example I have 12 balls when I use the bomb from the chest, I get 11 balls left which it doesn\'t do that for my brother. I hope you can fix this.',
       'It\'s the best! But there are a bit too many ads, but the thing I like about the ads that they are shorter than most ads.',
       'So far it\'s great. Could use some improvements in the video and audio effects to differentiate the amount of bubbles you bring down, otherwise, great.',

      'Lemme just say ketchapp your games are soooo good!! And addictive including this one it\'s fun and ever since the first play I\'ve been hooked there are barely any adds and the graphics are phenomenal. I play it all the time plz don\'t change this, if u do your going to loose my five starsüåüüåüüåüüåüüåü.',
       'Most of my apps are from Ketchapp. Their creativity and style of games have just been wanting me to download more and more! Right now, Ketchapp is one of my most favourite game groups ever! Keep making more! I don\'t have any improvements, which means that their games are top notch!',
       'Patheitc. Being such a fast paced game you cannot have the blocks starting to move a split second before you\'re going to pass it. Makes the game pretty impossible from the first level. For something that was supposed to be fun, is more frustrating. You need severe luck on your side to get a win. Recommended do not download',
       'Its a good concept, but you need to update it, and make sure the blocks no longer move. Right now, it is by far the most luck based skill game. It is impossible to dodge the moving blocks, so if they are to move, they should move much slower',
       'This game can be a fun one but it keeps moving slow when I roll over about 5 or more of the yellow arrows and it\'s distracting. Idk if the game is new but could you review this please. Only one \'kind\' of obstacle is there. The black boxes. Otherwise good game. üòä',
       'I think it is a great way for amiee to get design for her Xbox 360 and help her get over with her anger with her sister and to help her to figure out what\'s the matter but what is the most important thing is to be a fantastic family together but why are we so lonely.... Well i think it is a great opportunity to make new friends to life' ,

      'Hey RobTop, the game is ok, but there is one issue. im used to playing geometry dash with my samsung chromebook 3 (it doesn\'t have touchscreen) and when i press the spacebar on my computer (this is the same issue on geometry dash lite and subzero) it doesn\'t let me jump. And can you let geometry dash world players create and play user created levels. Fix and add this and I will give you 5 stars. Gameplay and graphics are nice.',
       'Got all the way to the end,  and an as popped up accidentally clicked on it cuz it was being slow,  and ended up having to restart all of the levels,  fix this,  it doesn\'t happen with the other geometry dash games,  just this one every time I exit my data gets deleted...  Fix then 5 stars',
       'When I heard that this was out, I rushed to the Play Store, freed up my storage and installed this app. This is fantastic, as I had been craving for 2.1.

       'This is really hard. I can\'t buy the full game as I am only 9, but I think I am missing out on a lot. Please add check points to normal mode as some levels are basically impossible',
       'This game stress me out but the next day when I play it I beat the lv in one go and fills my heart up with joy! So what if the control\'s are sensitive? I know they are.. but if you take a day and give it another go you know what happens and you do great!',
       'I love this game just...can you fix one glitch? On the final level final area the wave is bugged ...when I tap it goes down by itself! Can you please fix it? I was trying over 3 hours to make it but I can\' t because of the glitch :( Please fix it.' ,

When I was moving around, the controls were a bit slippery, but it was a big upgrade from other apps. I recommend you download it if you like medium difficulty pixel art, although there are a few simpler ones.',
       'In general it\'s a fun game but the controls aren\'t easy to control/get use to and aren\'t smooth. There aren\'t many new drawings every day either. What I like is that some of the ones where you need to pay you can watch an ad to unlock it. It\'s also a great time killer.',

      'It\'s a really fun game, but sometimes you\'ll play a video to revive your shark and the video will play but you don\'t get another life afterwards. It\'s hard to believe that it is a WiFi problem because if it was an ad wouldn\'t be able to load at all. Also, I have paused the game before and come back minutes later and the game had kicked me out and not saved any coins/gems gained from that round. They clearly have a few bugs to work out.',
       'OMG! I love the gameplay in this arcade game I love everything about it. It is very cool that you can evolve sharks that can eat more stuff. Keep the updates coming it would be better if you added more sharks in this game . I recommend downloading this game if you want something to do in a long amount of time. This is so addictive I can\'t stop playing it!',
       'My apologies for the negative review lately. But to be honest, I have to use VPN just to log-in in Google Play and enable cloud sync or else, I wouldn\'t be able to sync my progress. Just a little request, can you make the gameplay smoother for lower end devices, such as devices with 1GB RAM? It lags frequently during gameplay. Thanks a lot!',
       'Really fun , good graphics, funny screaming when we eat the humans. The big sharks health will drain too fast after 10 - 20 mins. Overall really good game when ur offline',
       'Amazing game. I completed this game in 48 minutes Hahaha! Because I used luckypatcher :) I downloaded the luckypatcher in Googlechrome But it can harm your Device..... And the last shark is Moby dick His baby is as big as Megalodon.',
       'Requiring Google Play Games to save is lame.  It should save my game stats to sd card.   I can not even log in to Google Play Games, so I guess I will never see the good sharks.' ,

Plus every time an add comes up it takes me straight to Google play with out me even tapping on it. It gets annoying. Another thing I don\'t like about this game is after a certain amount of levels you have to watch a video (add again) just to unlock more levels. And it does this more than once to. On the flip side it is a good game that gets the brain running and the levels do get more challenging throughout.',

       'The game was great than EA got to it with there sticky fingers and put adds everywhere, it isn\'t the same game I enjoyed ages ago. It\'s just another add infested game now, even if you do pay for it l. The charm is gone',
       'Irritating. At first it gives you an option of playing a video to receive additional help. Which works only for the first time. Next time onwards no way to cancel the video in case you don\'t want to install it. It is so frustrating. Either allows to cancel or tell the users what to do next. Worst way of promoting other apps.',
       'Why ask people to pay to have ads removed and still have so many features that you need to watch ads for? It just seems like a rip off to me very disappointed in this purchase',
       'I had to update it so I did and when I wanted to play after that, it says "watch video to get extra seed slot" WHICH I ALREADY PAID FOR WITH THE COINS I COLLECTED ALL THESE TIMES. Even before the update, it has so many ads but this is much worse. Definitely not happy with the update.',
       'Well this game is one of the first ones I\'ve played and it\'s very good idea inspire you to play this all because it\'s mad and sick I think you\'ll love it maybe not all of you but definitely more than the people who will hate it which is rare for people to hate this app so I think you should install it trust me it\'ll be good.

      'Tokens take too long to refill. Level up gives a few coins, why not a token refill? Tournament champion gets 4 tokens. 7 tokens for a day? Cheapskates! When do you want us to play, every 5 days? So cheap in giving prizes, guessing you want us to buy eh? I\'ll give myself a few weeks playing this game and am out. No daily prize wheel, just a daily "less than 20 coins" reward. Sooooooo cheap!',
       'Classic UNO with a couple of modern twists and turns. I have never spent any real money in a game and I don\'t ever plan to, but here you also don\'t really need to. I\'ve won many tournaments and got really far in the game without buying anything. You get extra coins by winning and completing daily tasks, as well as watching ads. But you\'re not forced to watch them. It\'s not just about luck. You have to play smart to win, just like any other card game. I love it.',
       'Great game in the graphics department however, I agree with other consumers when they say the special abilities you can obtain by playing this game ruins it. Simple is best and this uno app is anything but. Sometimes when I log in, the tokens don\'t even recharge overnight and I have to wait a few more hours before I play three free rounds of uno before you have to pay for more tokens. Very hit and miss app.',
       'Okay, this is actually a decent game HOWEVER unless you buy your way through its almost impossible to win tournaments.  They shouldn\'t be putting people in the "club" and level 100+ with people who are like level 10 and not in this "club" it makes it almost impossible for them to win unless they\'re INSANELY lucky.  People with cheats can turn you from being at uno and winning, to being in last place in seconds and it honestly just kills the enjoyment of the game',
       'Greatest game ever~~¬§mean it.  The Updated game even better.  Need to be easier to play with Friends that you JUST made ~~maybe REPLAY!!!  üò¨ üò≤ üò† üòê üò≠  Friends where are you? Great for tablets.   I am UNO happy . Happy New years  .Oh don\'t terminate the game unless you just have to, I well try finding something other to do. Nothing Good ever lasts anyway.   Thanks for reading.  UNO POWER.',
       'Awesome game, definitely feels like I\'m playing the UNO card game. However, the little bit of energy you have is a killjoy. Especially since matches are short because it\'s timed and most of the time, there\'s no real winner. I don\'t mind the energy so much as I mind the games being cut short and instead the winner is decided by a point system.' ,

      'Sadly have to rate the app with 1*  I did 3 10x summons and got nothiing but 3 stars. It says you have a chance at a 5 star hero so id actually like a chance. And since I can get a 5 star, I can\'t win raids. Would love it if the game devs actually made the game fair',
       'Raid system sucks. Use up all of my resources on reroll to find an opponent I can actually beat. Still lose to people with 4&5 star heroes at same team power. Opponent heroes attack very quickly, I\'ve had raid where 4 or 5 attack in the same turn and just get decimated when they are going to attack again in the next turn or two. Plus the risk and reward are very uneven, win 10 trophies and lose 50?',
       'This game has a lot of potential but after playing for a bit you\'ll find the gem rewarding is too low, pvp matching engine is way mismatched, got higher lvl players to fight at starting lvl.. Even saved 300 gems & the hero rewarded sucked for all my efforts.. Need lots of work I feel..',
       'Great game, addictive, excellent characters (Heros) and gameplay. Not very friendly on the wallet though, as the only things close to a value are the occasional deals that are offered. Those are also the only guaranteed items, everything else is a "chance of getting", which is a rip-off, and will rip you off.',
       'A good game. Couldn\'t stop playing it at the start! I recommend to all gamers and players. You collect heroes, upgrade resources and build a base. How could you dislike it?',
       'I never write reviews but this game is awesome.  This game has two different style games in one. I generally don\'t play either one, but the combination keeps it from getting boring. Beautiful graphics on a an s8+ screen and NO ADS!!!!!!!' ,

      'Lost all of my bikes when I re-download the app. It shows the 500+ wins I have, but I don\'t even see a way to get the basic ones unlocked again without paying for their stupid VIP package. It sucks that they ruined this app, looking at the iOS version its obvious they haven\'t bothered to update this in years.',
       'Overall, the game is OK . But there is a few issues. My bike tips back and I can\'t stop it from tipping back until I die. But this doesn\'t happen all the time. It happens about every five weeks. Also, I was given a 5$ gift card and a 10$ gift card but I can\'t buy any of the bikes.',
       'After only playing a few short but addicting levels, I am already having a blast! The game may not look spectacular on a technical level. But the gameplay is so freaking fun! And the controls aren\'t too complicated either. Recommended for everyone!',
       'It\'s a fun little game at first, but has many, many flaws. You have to link it to your Facebook account if you wanna play all maps. There are way too many ads, they force you to buy their bikes which are ridiculously overpriced and overpowered, so you can\'t play multiplayer because people who bought those bikes will always beat you. That\'s just ridiculous. Not to mention it\'s very buggy. Sometimes you\'re racing someone who\'s in a completely different track than you. It used to be fun, now it\'s just stupid.',
       'Been playing for a few years and absolutely love the game.  Got a new phone, Moto G5 Plus, and now there is a half second pause every time I hit the gas or break in every race.  Extremely annoying when you\'re racing friends.',
       'Bugs and Glitches... Multiplayer links are not being sent back and forth properly. Some games keep giving me desert level 1 and not showing any replays or ghost bikes are doing a different levels then the one I am suppose to be racing against. Please Fix!!!' ,

If you need help in any of those subjects (or you just like a bit of fun ) I would dwfinately say this is the game for you.',

       'Cool game, but it has a few bugs. The one where items go through some thing and one of them gets lost - it doesn\'t show me the items going into the thing so all I can do is guess.',
       'Grrrrrrrreat for ppl who use their brain for the right reason. Theres To many idiots around nowadys it\'s like being stuck in that movie idiocracy I swear.',
       'Too many ads plus its deaigned to get you invested with easier puzzles and then make them next to impossible unless you use gems.  Guess how you get gems: by watching more ads or spending money.  Otherwise good game.  Haha.' ,

      'This is actually quite addictive & enjoyable. Definitely distracts you & helps kill time or zone out when your brain is too busy. My daughters, (16 yrs & 5 yrs) along w my son (12 yrs) play w me, and we try to race each other thru the levels. I would give this wee game 5 stars if it weren\'t for the amount of ads & the length of time the ads play. If the ads were adjusted a wee bit it would be easier to do the side by side races. Hope y\'all üëç it.',
       'I abseloutly love this game. The controls are amazing the games are great and it is so stress relieving and I would play this in every second of my spare time. I would totally reccomend this for kids and adults!!! Go and get this free app that I am addicted to üòÄüòç',
       'Only play it offline. Otherwise the only thing it\'s good for is helping you test out what kind of games you\'d like most, so you can find other apps with the puzzles you like that have less annoying ads!!! Never had an app give so many pop ups',
       'Proper sick, proper sound, having dreams about half the puzzles it\'s THAT addictive, had quite a quality one where I was in NJ and I was the PuzzleDon because I could just do all the puzzles proper well and am not even American, 10/10 would recommend just for the dreams tbh',
       'GREEDY DEVELOPERS!üò§ I loved it! But... All the good games, have point pay-walls! Not to mention that there are ads. ADS EVERYWHERE!!! SO ANNOYING!!! I KNOW THIS IS HOW YOU MAKE ü§ë, BUT NEVER FROM ME AGAIN!',
       'This game is full of great little brain teasers. Not too difficult, not too easy. All in all, a great way to kill some time, without mindlessly gunning down zombies.' ,

      'As much as I like this game Im thinking about uninstalling it bcuz its still messing up. Been having to repeat the Grape Jam making part bcuz it will say it needs to restart every single time it gets to the part it says "you wanna know a secret about my brother Daryll hes scared of chickens" part. Its a very relaxing FARMING GAME! Doesn\'t have all of the pressure the others tend to have...',
       'This was my favorite game but lately it has so many problems. Things I\'ve completed keep DISSAPPERING and I have to keep redoing them to move on in the game. I\'ve been asking for help for a few months now. Also there are tons and tons of issues with the game crashing. I\'ve done everything to fix this that I was told to do yet nothing is working. As for contacting the link sent to the reply to this I\'ve also done that a few times now with no help. I\'ve been using the in game help tab and keep getting told its been sent to another help team. I\'ve spent Way too much real money on this game and if not fixed soon will want it all back and the deleting the game.   Please fix this so once again I can give it 5 stars. Since the last update the game is now closing in it\'s own. This is very frustrating. So again as I\'ve asked above please fix this .',
       'Fun game, but...What happened?  Don\'t like the snow,  it lightened all the colors of everything, they are not as vivid as they usually are.. With cataracts,  too hard on eyes,  all print got really small and can\'t read anymore.  Will have to quit til eyes get fixed.',
       'Love the game, easy to understand and they have videos on how to use the equipment and make ur farm expand. Also, their customer service is great!!  Recently my phone was stole and had to get a new phone.  Familyfarm helped me recover my farm within a couple of days.  Their services were quick and resourceful.',
       'The game used to be good but it has been hanging up repeatedly with the recent updates. Open a treasure chest/daily chest to get a reward will forever be loading and not running. Have to shut down the whole game and redo the quests again. Auto-save for the game had also been unstable, with us having to redo the stuff that we have done previously. It\'s very frustrating given that we have planted some crops and only to realise that the crops we had planted were not actually planted when we revisit the farm to harvest those crops.',
       'I really enjoy this game but lately it\'s been a pain to get the green mystrons you need to complete certain timed items. The Balloon video ads needs to be fixed you shouldn\'t be forced to download other games to get the mystrons or having to reload the game because ads freeze upon playing. I\'ve only been having this issue over the past couple of days but it\'s making me want to give up anything needing mystrons of any color.' ,

Also being able to rotate pieces would be handy, granted not as challenging however.',

      'I would give all 5 stars, but I have one issue. When I\'m doing surgeries, I start getting docked heartbeats because, even though my finger is moving along the screen, it\'s not fully cutting. Didn\'t have this problem when I first started playing a couple weeks ago. And when I suction, I\'m hitting every spot but it doesn\'t work well and takes forever. Or when I\'m trying to give an epinephrine shot, I keep going in the motion they say but nothing happens and I lose out. I\'m pressing the screen and moving in the right direction. Otherwise I love this game.',
       '***Update*** The game recently had an update, which is fine so far, but for the love of God I do not want to watch a 5 minute twitch video of some guy playing a game to earn a bonus reward. Sort yourselves out!  I would like this game more if while you\'re completing a surgery and an issue arises (heart attack, breathing, etc) the interphase was easier to use. The timing is way off, thus making it very difficult. There isn\'t even a tutorial with each new task.',
       'Stay clear people. After reaching level 11 and spending plenty ¬£\'s on hearts, I had to do an update which sent me back to the start all over again. Therefore lost all my much effort and dedication to a then good game. Very frustrating and feeling cheated and conned!! üò¢',
       'I love this game. But there is one problem. I have tried to upgrade reception room to level 3. I give 1 lakh and it showed me 24 hours to upgrade. Then i closed the app and after two hours it does not show any updates in progress. I lost my money and i have pending task with reception 3rd level.',
       'The game was working fine last night. Today it keeps crashing. I start the game and a minute later it crashes. When I start a surgery it crashes, so that wastes the energy. I feel like I spent my money on hearts for no reason. Please fix this issue!',
       'Is a good game to pass the time, but I have the Samsung Note8 and the stylus does not work in the game.  This is very disappointing because I believe that it would make it much better and you would have the feel of having a tool in your hand like a real surgeon.' ,

      'I think there should be option of chatting with guild members and other players not voice chatting but message ones.  There should be some research option in every guild or either there should be some Commander talent points by which we can increase some of the tactics of team & player.  Main Idea :  I think there should be some event in which 2 guilds can fight with each other & there should be option of ally & others.  I know it\'s kinda different game but it will make fun to game.   Overall this game is best and addictive,  Thanks for making this game.  Great effort by dev team.  Love you.',
       'This game is good fun but pls can u stop peoee from running u over as when 8 get in top 3 some keeps running me over. It\'s still and amazing games but when people run u over its boring and wish u could stop people from doing this   is th8nkthere u should maybe be able to drive places but when u want to fight they have to get out and shoot and have a proper gun fight . Overall this is a great game my favourite mobile game and it\'s really enjoyable. But pls can u make people not being able to do this. Thankyou',
       'great game!  i love the game, its a great game to pass time, with epic moments like a random dancing gun and etc. I have played other games like this on my phond i still prefer FF. BG, the update was also good love the addition of the grenade. 1 thing that would be good to add is a chat box when players are still in lobby. I would have given this 5 star but There are still bugs and glitches',
       'Itu a great game. But there are something you should add like more vehicle, weapon, bom, and inside the supply crate add more item. Second.,when i use medkite it dont do anything, you should make it move when using medkite. And last,  please make the grass and tree taller because it hard to hide inside small grass',
       'I love this game!! Graphics are nice and controls are awesome! but there\'s one thing I want to ask. Can you make it free when we change nickname for the first time? It so will take a long time for me to get 800 diamonds...Pls make it free for the first time...',
       'It is one of the best pubg ...as far as gameplay is concerned. But it\'s matchup(auto) is pretty messed up. It connects me with players who speak different language...hope you will fix this issue...or recommend a solution before I change this rating to 3~4 star' ,

      'Pretty good design, but there is a cheater mode which tells you when one is wrong even if it\'s not apparent. So the fastest times are always really fast even for the hard ones. Also the ad bar is right below the numbers so you accidentally hit it when you play. Pretty sure that\'s intentional to get extra clicks, but super annoying.',
       'I love this game. I can play nice and easy games when I have "brain fog" or when I\'m feeling better play the hard games. Still haven\'t been able to finish an expert one in under 30 mins although I will keep on trying.  I understand the need for ads but putting them between each game is ridiculous!',
       'The ads are too frequent (after each game play) very annoying, and you have to wait too long for the option to close them.  If I wanted those other games I would have downloaded them already.  I\'ll probably uninstall because of the ads.',
       'Over all....quite nice, challenging but not throw the bloody phone difficult. I really like the colour options. So far I\'ve completed all january and most of the up to date febuary puzzle. 8/10 always room for improvement but definitely worth a few moments here and there.',
       'I NEVER thought I would like this game. As it turns out it is so much fun...so far. I\'m just a beginner. Soduku is a very addictive game and thrilling when you "get it!" This particular game is designed very simply and clearly, which I like. The only drawback (hence only 4 stars) is that the "choosing" numbers at the bottom are spaced too close to each other and I often tap the wrong one accidentally, making my choice incorrect. They need to be a larger or thicker font or be further apart from each other. Otherwise I am excited to move my levels forward.',
       'The game in itself isn\'t bad but I\'ve completed a puzzle in 10 minutes and for the past half an hour I don\'t know what to do next, does it pop up on the screen \'You have finished\' or do we just move on? I\'ve been looking for any place that I\'ve gone wrong but I haven\'t found any' ,

      'Why in the f**k does this require an internet connection. Fallout shelter is the same thing but doesn\'t need internet. Sure you can use internet for purchases and rewards but it definitely should not be required. Please consider making this offline compatible and I will change my review to 5 stars and a positive actual review of the game. Thank you.',
       'Definitely worth downloading and trying out.. It\'s just like fallout shelter but a little more. You can do a story line and attack other players rather then just sending people out and HOPING to get something good. It\'s a little slow at first but it\'s really quite alot of fun and the creators actually listen to its players.',
       'Good game but when your rank gets high all of a sudden most enemies are too powerful. Then it takes forever to gear up. Solution is to deliberately lose and lower your rank. Not good. Also you will find yourself with a lot of gear after you played a while. Would be nice to able to sort it, not only for your different warriors but also all the production gear. Would be good to be able to more easily compare gear in your stash and what your inhabitants are wearing. It\'s a bit messy now.',
       'Deceptive in game offers.   Be careful of what you think you are buying.  I purchased a limited time offer to instantly increase the level of my barracks, vault and training room but after paying found out only my training room was upgraded with the purchase.  When I notified the game support of my findings they refused to upgrade my barracks and vault and are refusing to refund me my payment stating that I could have clicked some sort of link with some fine print stating upgraded rooms will not be upgraded by the purchase. I am contesting the payment and be careful of the offers you think you are buying because you may not get what you expect to get.',
       'Definitely P2W but if you have patience, there is a little fun to be had. I\'ll never spend a cent on this game and I know eventually progress will halt because of it. *Game no longer opens after Feb3 update. Sits at loading screen for longer than I have attention for. **And I\'m done. This game doesn\'t hold a candle to the fun and longevity of FOS.',
       'I think the gameplay is good and the caatle building aspect is fun.  However, the level scaling is way off.  You get a point between throne room 4 and 5 and can\'t do a whole lot.  Losing fights when your characters are maxed out in training.  Other than that its pretty solid.' ,

      'It\'s nice game - very nice graphic, very smooth moving - it would be 5 stars. BUT - I payed for levels 13 and 14 , and the game does not allow me to play in random order - it\'s not possible to play no. 23 without finishing all numbers before. If you are stuck in some number, you cannot go to another one - you MUST BUY hint!!! It means - you PAID for the game, but you MUST PAY again for hint - or you are blocked in PAID  game. It\'s just not fair.',
       'I loved flow free from a young age. I\'ve played until 9√ó9 pack but when I reached a certain level,  the game stopped working after that and I\'ve tried over and over again to go in but the game just keeps bring me back to the home screen and keeps stopping. Please fix it. I really want to play the remaining levels and packs',
       'Great game. Keep coming back to it. I find it relaxing solving the puzzles, though it has become super easy! All versions are great. All in all, awesome job! One of my favourites, and works in any situation. Quick break at work, something productive ? Play. Something to do before sleep? Play. Got a few extra mins? Play! Wanna challenge yourself on timed? Play! Haha.',
       'Was a great game until about 48 hours ago. I didn\'t mind the ads but now after every level I complete there\'s a video ad. Even then I would deal with it but it closes my music player. So after the ad I have to go to the music player and start it again but then when I switch back to the game I have to relaunch and reselect the level. Gets annoying to have to do after every level',
       'Fantastic game. Real addiction game I\'d say. It\'s an awesome time killer. Different types of levels never make the game boring. Graphics is okay. Number of ads for a free to play game is less compared to other games out in the market which is a relief.Overall I would give 4.5/5',
       'Love this app! I prefer the original version over the walls, hex, etc. and have solved every single one of them. Need more puzzles. Although I\'m sure I can solve them all again as it\'s impossible to remember these. Either way, I cannot get enough of them.' ,

The only down side is that the spins cost alot of coins and those coins can be hard to earn. So 4.5 stars i would rate it is that was a option but its not so i rate it a a big fat 5',
       'this game is the bomb. it is stupid that they asked you is this game beautiful, of course not, people die, and crack their necks, backs, and shoulder blades. This game all in all soooooooo fun and you should totally get it. just say no if you want to write a reaport on this game because it will ask you is this game is beautiful which it is not.

And I get even more coins. It\'s really rare to get  locations or characters.    Please change that so we get Moore chances to get good prizes  But this is a very fun game and',

      'A very fun game that is both simple and a bit challenging because you have to make literal split-second taps to get it to work properly. The only downside is that it\'s a very short game. There are only two places to colonize and once you\'ve done them and reached level 10 on both, there\'s really nothing left to do. It would be nice if they added more levels to colonize or some other form of continuation.',
       'Good game, played it over a long period here and there and I\'ve basically completed it.  Would love to see more planets! And bigger challenges, as currently every time I go on it my little explorers are making over 1.5 million a day and I\'ve got no where to take my space funding! Haha   Great game imo, just needs more features, planets, asteroids maybe. :) Good job.',
       'It\'s a fun game, just need more planets to jump to and more rocket skins. The colony is just a bunch of people standing on the planet. When I think of colony, I think of buildings and sustaining life and such. Would be nice to see the \'colony\' grow bigger each time you rank up. (Example, more buildings etc.) Also, a choice of a button to press when detaching the rocket and different rocket shapes to choose from. Thank you',
       'Before the update it was quick to grind lots of cash but still it took some time. With my current build, I was reaching 10k+ averaging Greats and Awesomes but now after the update I barely scratch 8K! You guys nerfd the fuccc out the rocket power!!! NEW PLAYERS DON\'T EVEN BOTHER WITH THIS! IT WILL TAKE YOU A VERY, VERY, VERY LONG TIME TO GRIND!!!',
       'Well I was only shown this game last Friday and by today (Wednesday) I have reached level 10 on earth and Mars, both my rockets are fully upgraded. Nothing to do now, I thought you would be able to set up buildings and colonies and keep jumping to different planets. But no. If it\'s enjoyable but over quick, nothing more to it after you you level 10. Can keep taking astronauts up but to what end? You don\'t go no further, they make you money but you\'re maxed out on spending anyway. Shame, concave been really good',
       'A Ads. You get most of your coins by watching ads. So if you want to level up then be prepared to spend some time watching ads. Also an ad will pop up in the middle of the actual gameplay and throw off your rhythm. Gameplay lasts MAYBE 10 seconds, why they need to stick an add in there beats me. Good control,concept,gameplay. Simple and fun' ,

      'Good fun and very addictive. I see people moaning about the adds üòß but what can you expect from a free game? You get an add pop up after about 5 puzzles and to be honest it is only for a few seconds....just close it if you don\'t want to see them.',
       'I usually can find something "wrong" with almost any app or game, but this is about as close to perfect as I\'ve played or used. I did not find the ads to be *nearly* as bothersome as most games. Good stuff!!',
       'It is a simple game, with a elegant environment, is interesting, relaxing, a good game who fight against stress and angryness. I really highly recomand for everyone doesen\'t matter the age, and I want to congratulate the team who work at this game for providing such a simple and high quality game! Bravo!',
       'To many adds to the level of being annoying. Game it self is ok but can\'t see myself going through so many challenges to get to higher levels. I\'ll pass.',
       'Love the game but WAY to many ads. Not bad the first level. A 5 sec. ad every 2 or 3 boards. But by half way through the 2nd level it\'s a 30 sec. ad after every board. Definitely going to uninstall it. Too bad.',
       'Hated all the ads every game has an ad! Don\'t waste your time! Uninstalling because of ad bombardment.' ,

      'This game is really good and fun but strate after you lose all 3 of your lives it goes straight onto an add.

      'This now a prize example of a freemium game that needs a premium option. I would gladly pay ¬£10 as a one off purchase to do away with the need to say for lives. In the past games worthy of a one-off fee would offer it and this issue such game that should consider it. I will never pay for any in app purchases on any game and I am sure I am not alone. This has 5* written all over it but the long wait times and exorbitant cost of energy replenishing means this doesn\'t get anything higher than average.',
       'Loved the game but if the life was free this waiting for minutes to play again is not cool. Also noticed if you have to score more than 1 goal and you make a mistake you have to start from the same goal you already scored. If we can get the requirements before each challenge that would make it much more fun otherwise I love this game a lot keep updating for more seasons. Thank you. I am on Level 560 with 1257 stars I am awaiting Season 29. If you can also create a full football game with same concept. This is a Great game!!! Thank you developers keep developing Great games like these!!!',
       'Wonderful! Game by first touch   But I can\'t wait till the hearts üíö are filled!  So Reduce the time. Improve this game more and more and create a new exciting games.  I have finished 390 levels. And I have a doubt what is the last level and what happens after it? All the best for ur future and I\'m a biiiiiiig fans of u guys!!  Hands off',
       'SCORE  HERO RULES This game is so sick dudes. It so cool that this gives us idea that how to play soccer or football. Gameplay is so smooth . They players show us some epic skills . It has an commentary. The worst part was the heart. I can\'t wait till it get refilled ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§ this. Graphics are great . Just reduce the time of refilling the energy . Overall this game cool. Thanks for the game FTG.',
       'Do you know what? This game is really bad. If you\'re calling this game really good, then you must be blind. The graphics are really bad, it is really laggy and whenever someone puts in a review, you don\'t fix it. You never do any updates to impove this game also. And the fact that you have to wait for your hearts to regen is so annoying. You should remove the hearts *now*. That is why I think this game is so bad and that I rate this game 1‚òÜ.',
       'Overall, the game is retarded.  Basically, is the goalkeeper Yashin or something? The goalkeeper just dives into my ball without running or jumping. Also, my team is just retarded. They can\'t even do a header in important moments when I have lack of hearts. Also, if I don\'t shoot right into the corner of the goal net, it never gets in. This is such an impossible game. The worst thing is that it crashes sometimes. This company was such a great company until this game got released.  P.S. Make CPU difficulties. The game is basically unbeatable.' ,

      'Game is really great! Amazing graphics, amazing cars, lots of continuous fun! A few bugs and connection issues which can be frustrating at times especially when your team depends on you for points. Though I believe they\'ll eventually fix these issues as this is the BEST racing game out there and it\'s only getting BETTER!',
       'Best onlin3 mobile racing EVER!! IM A VETERAN GAMER AND THIS GAME IS HANDS DOWN TOP OF THE MOBILE RACING GAME. Great detail and graphics. Precision tuning. REALISTIC CARS IN ALL ASPECTS. PLUS an added Bonus is it features FAST AND FURIOUS AND CARS FROM THE SERIES. I need access to more cars. Its so hard to get more silver or gold to get newer cars updated.',
       'Customer support has won me over. They have literally provided the best resolution can think of for the game removing all my fusion parts. Hopefully I don\'t have many issues in the future but this one time moment has definitely filled me with confidence that in future, zynga will fairly sort things out.',
       'Excellent graphics and easy to upgrade but the live races leave something to be desired,  you start off the same way you do on single player mode against the story line but in live race it makes me sit at starting line for almost 2 full seconds before I can take off. I have unlimited data and full bars with my service, defiantly not worth the effort on live races.',
       'Great single player. Fun gameplay thats simple but entertaining. Decent customization and great upgrades. A little pushy on spending money but it\'s ignorable. My issue is with multiplayer. I can never connect with anyone which I don\'t have any interest in. But two out of three of my goals are for beating other players. One wants to me to beat thirty people. That\'s ridiculous.',
       'If you have a problem with this game, do not expect help from support. They quite simply do not care. They give copy and paste responses to all requests for assistance. Special 1 off vehicles are far too expensive and give little return.  The longer l play it, the less l like it.  Connection issues have continued for 6 months with no solution in sight. SUPPORT NOW REFUSES TO ANSWER MY QUESTIONS. THIS GAME IS A RORT!' ,

      'Great strategy based game, awesome, however out of 326 levels only 323 could be completed. Level 324 the colors are not chain linked they are totally erratic and the colors you\'re given are inconsistent. They alternate in color as well to ensure failure. Still I enjoyed it. Side note, I played the game without using any cheats, which is the reason level 324 is a trapdoor the idea is to purchase cheats. Thanks great game.',
       'Fun, but... Worst aim system. You can see ball curve away instead of following straight path. Color balls rotate without your input. You are shooting blue, but yellow goes instead. This happens very frequently. Lastly, had 20 straight of same color. Only needed one of another color to finish that level. Still playing, but game is very frustrating.',
       'Takes so long to start a level you have lost interest in the game before it starts. Keeps my attention for about 30 secs. Phone will not respond to button presses after game has finished.',
       'The coding in this game obviously needs work.  Balls given not colors needed.  Spot aimed at missed and ball lands somewhere else.  The last chest I opened lvl 30 something gave no item.',
       'It is inexcusable to allow ads to make such noise when both my phone is in silent mode AND I have the sound off in the game settings! I went over other reviews and the developers wanted to know which ads. Seriously?! How about all of them?! They have to be aware yet refuse to fix the problem. Do not download this intrusive app. Also I get a migraine with the annoying "Ready? Let\'s go!" voice when the sound is on.',

      'Ok, so I will be calm in this review. Whenever I have the same car in a battle with red, we ram each other, but they push me off the map with ease. The main reason why I wrote a review for this game is that you should make the alien levels a little easier. The last level for it is way too hard, you can barely aim at the boss. The controls are hard too. Also can you optimize the game for the Samsung Galaxy tab A?',
       'New update stucks a lot and 1st time my mobile hangs a lot due to this game and btry drains faster than ever. plz crt these mistakes to continue njoying this game',
       'Ok. I admit this game is pretty fun. But the missions, especially the hardcore ones, are ridiculously hard. So if you want a challenge, I recommend this game. But if you rage over really dumb things like me, then I definitely do not recommend it.',
       'I have a problem. It won\'t let me  replay what I did its bad I want it fixed. Can you help?',
       'I think its really fun but the new update is bad in my opinion because for the superstar mission chest you can\'t get bolts anymore which makes it harder to get bolts so I have 600 bolts and I\'m so close to get a legendary car so yeah I think u guys should put back the getting bolts thing love you guys',
       'Fantastic time passer, very fun... but where is my progress? I had a lot of vehicles and other things but with the new update, all of its gone... can I have it back?' ,

      'I only rate games for two reasons. If they are very bad or very good. This one is good. Yes there are sone ads but they are smart enough to  use them in a creative way so that you are not frustrated with them and they go by fast or you actually use them to advance the game play WHEN you decide to on your own in certain situations.  Anyway, the game is kind of addictive and super fun. VERY cool fun game Congrats to the designers',
       'I think this game is awesome! But I have some suggestions. When you flip your tank in a battle there should be a button that ONLY works when you flip your tank you press that button and then it will flip you back on to your tracks so you don\'t die. Is there anymore tanks you could add? Because I think there should be a few more. There\'s should also be achievements when you do something specific. Maybe some daily missions that expire after Friday and start Tuesday. Maybe more maps to battle in. And more bosses to fight. And a little bit more health. And for each tank should have the health and firerate as it\'s level gets higher. And some more enemys. And a higher upgrade number like 20.',
       'I don\'t normally comment on these but this game was so terrible I had to say something. The controls are garbage and the physics are overly dramatized to the point that you are more likely to die from your tank flipping over than you are from actual tanks. I do like the idea of the game but it was executed so haphazardly that it comes across as little more than another micro transaction mobile game',
       'Well takes to long to collect coins.and even though my tanks max it doesn\'t make it any further then when it was basic. The rank status has a glitch where it may climb up 3 or more times before it stays. I think you need to make more coins, and make an actual difference when you upgrade your tank"heck my tank does same damage to each tank now at max as it did when no upgrades were done"',
       'The aim of developers of the game is just to extort money.  So less coins even after you finish a level. And you need so so much coins to buy a tank.  Also the game always start with level 1, if you die at any level.  Don\'t  know how it got editors choice game tag.  (they must have got some real coins from developers)',
       'This game is so much fun! It\'s so addicting however there r a couple of drawbacks.. one the first tank is super clumsy! I can\'t tell y\'all how many times where I have been in situations where I would either shoot  be nose to nose with an enemy and some how the tank flips over and blows up. Second I feel like u don\'t have as much control over the tank especially it\'s up in the air' ,

      'Game just made to make money. Well of course, all games are like that but other games you can enjoy. I\'m getting offer to buy special packs of gold all the time and that is annoying. Of course Ill buy sone stuff and spend sone money but first I want to make sure game is type of game I want to play for longer time. I also received card to move my base for free. Cool, great thing. So I decided to move my base and there is interesting thing happening. When I choose where I want to teleport I need to pay in gold. When I choose to use free move card I cant choose location. So I ended up using card for nothing and now only option is to earn or buy gold. Is it a bug or made on purpose so that players must buy gold I don\'t know, but I know I\'m deleting game because I want game that I can enjoy more. If you fix this problem let me know and Ill maybe give second chance to game. Anyway its too sad for such a cool game.',
       'Pretty good game with a couple glaring problems.  1) chat in game is toxic, to a point I want to turn it off, sexual harrasment is in full swing  2) way to many clans at the start , this does not promote long term growth or even loyalty.  Needs to be hard set rules you need to be lvl 5 or 6 to even join a clan.',
       'Newbie dont play this game. It\'s was fun at first then you follow the instructions as normal. But at the end of the day you will get stuck and you will run out of supplies.. Their idea is to make you buy.',
       'I notice that there are people who criticised the game for being too violent. Well it\'s a game and that\'s how it is, not everyone enjoys things that are the same. My opinion, good game, a really good game. Few bug issues tho but i love it.',
       'After a week of play , I am getting to attack smaller cities , KILL KILL,  grate time filler,  some sexier clothing options for the (ladies) would be nice,  lots to do and manage, clans mates are important, so chose wisely. I am enjoying this immensely.  Edit after (time seems like forever,)  I am really enjoying this,  Negotiated a couple of Peace Treaties, built my crew and strength, I am getting to be a force to reckon with... But there are still bigger fish, frustrating  Would love a feature to hunt the attacker, but then that would backfire too,   Great game...lots of challenges and opportunities for growth,  Highly recommended   *****',
       'Be a lot better if you didn\'t have to pay so much money to be a contender, if your playing for fun it\'s ok but if you want to be worth a damn be prepared to spend 100s if not 1000s' ,

      'Ugh look people if u start playing this game oh wait if u had any sense u wouldn\'t. these adds are outrageous every time I die there an add I\'m not even kidding. My dad rates tones of games and I\'m the one playing some of them and I told my dad that these adds are so horrible I even had to report it. Now here me out great game but the adds. And in the beginning there is no instructions on how to do the game so like I said in the beginning there is a add at the end of every round so in the beginning there are many adds. Now i think there are more adds then game in this game. I\'m not trying to be mean so don\'t go cryingüò¢ to ur boss.',
       'The game is stupid. I HATE IT. It\'s very annoying because of all the ads. It\'s sad that some people actually LIKE  games with all these ads. I mean, WHO would give this game 5 STARS? That would just be an idiotic thing to do. ZIGL, This game stinks. I mean, REALLY SKINKS. It stinks worse than DOG POOP. HOW DO YA LIKE ME NAH?! I\'m not trying to be mean ZIGL, But I\'m just giving my opinion. Thanks for reading ZIGL, don\'t get mad at me and go cryingüò¢ to your boss. Bye!!ü§ô',
       'tbh it\'s a really good app! The only problem is that it gets a little boaring after a while (obviously that\'s my opinion) And I don\'t know if it\'s just me but there or tons of over 30 second ads.',
       'I like this game  very much cause you dont know what comes in front of you which makes this game more interesting. But 1 problem is there that the second i crash to any obstacle an add popups',
       'This game is the WORST!!! The controls don\'t work and there is not even demonstration on how to play. Also every time I retried to do it a stupid add came up. I AM FURIUS!!!! Do you expect me to have patience with this game? I hope not because I have no patience and this game totally pushed me to the limit and put me off playing on my tablet. If you do not want to be annoyed please don\'t get this app and if you do delete it straight away in my opinion. ( I don\'t mean to be rude but this game makes me very angry.) THE END!!!!!!!!!',
       'I really do like this game. It\'s a good way to learn to think quickly with what side you should move to. Although, it would be even better if you didn\'t have so many adds, but every rose must have it\'s thorns and I\'d say the adds are this roses thorns.' ,

       'First, I don\'t like that the game is in realtime it makes it a lot less fun and more boring. Secondly, I don\'t like that you HAVE to buy things just to get vip. I know that the prices are quite low but if you\'re just a kid like me then that limits what you can do. Lastly, I want more jobs and maybe even school to be playable it would just seem reasonable and make the game more addicting. Overall the game is really enjoyable but could do better, still keep up the good work!',
       'im not sure what\'s the cause of the problem but what i know is the sims\' act a lil bit freaky. i just redownloaded this game bcs i cant log in this game before bcs i just updated it. before this, the sims is ok, but now they act really awkward. when they\'re walking, they legs dont even move! it\'s like they\'re flying, plus when they\'re doing any action like "clean the dishes", they dont move, they just stand still in front of the sink. this is freaky. please reply to my review bcs i really want to know more about this. i really like this game except what i said above. this game is really addicting:).',
       'I like everything about this game no questions asked but i do find a few things annoying the main one is selling items in you inventory 1 at a time i wish there was a sell all for an item that would make this less annoying  to sell after house building and such. Please add a sell all oh and when do you think you can make more quests i really like doing them.',
       'Overall,  this is a great game. Two requests.  1) Selling multiple items at once.  I bought a load of junk and I need to sell it!  2) Make the schools "playable",  like the police station. I was talking to my sister about this and it\'d be cool if the schools were playable and you could build clubs inside it. Anyway,  I loved everything in the game! So fun,  so creative.',
       'For the fact that we can\'t sell multiple items at once is a big downer. I have accumulated so many windows, computers, chairs etc with watching the daily news ads and it\'s a complete pain to delete 30, 50, 70 or even more! items one by one. Please consider adding this function in the app as it\'s in the real The Sims games.' ,

      'There are ads every time you load something new as a level loads, again right after that. which is mentioned in multiple reviews. The game crashes every few levels and the Levels are now designed to be use the power ups for which you will end up paying for more. The first one was such a great game and some of these are enjoyable,  if you have the patience to wait for them.',
       'The ads are ridiculous. It crashes after some levels. I loved wheres my water 1 because I purchased it. Wish that was an option with this one. I\'ll probably uninstall and look for something else',
       'Ok I beat it but it was to many ads so many that after every level it would go to the home screen but im just glad they finally make the next level free i remember a lot of complaints on that also i was like waiting at the end to do some type of celebration but i dont know if i should uninstall it or like is something suppose to happen',
       'Omg because I can\'t save this app to ANYTHING I\'ve lost all my progress because my phone broke. And I\'ve spent alot of money on this. Why cant u ppl add google or adding facebook to save progress. What a waste. Fix it and I\'ll consider going back and spending more money to get ahead',
       'The overall game is superb but a bug causes the game to crash to my home screen Device:moto E4 power P.S i have the latest version too And also add the feature where we can sync our progress because i change my phones alot',
       'The stupid "Duck Rush" levels lag and you have to keep swipping to remove the dirt. I have finger burn and still can\'t pass level 28. Think I\'ll go back to the original and complete the achievements. PLEASE FIX THIS.' ,

       'Stopped working on level 2215 no matter what I did, but the fact that I played it to level 2215 shows that I enjoyed the game for quite some time. I was a good run.',
       'Can play for a long time.  I like that you are not forced to wait to come back for another chance.  Just play.....',
       '2/15/18. In reply to Developers response; As I stated in my original review, I DO understand the need for adds, but this game not o my have ads in between levels and to earn bonus bubbles & level helpers, it has ads after before & everything.  And giving a reply that players can get ad free play by buying the premium play is not a good business reply. Every player now a days knows that we can no longer play FREE uninterrupted games, we have to PAY for everything. As the apps say, the download is free, but we all know that the play is not.  Thank you for at least responding to my review. Most developers no longer address their negative reviews so they can improve the game experience. ******************* The game itself is fun and challenging at times, especially when it gives a colored bubble to shoot, but none of the bubbles in the puzzle match.  The biggest negative is the ads. I understand the need for adds, but to have ads immediately after a level is won and then again after you click next and the 30 second ads when additional shooting bubbles are requested is a bit extreme. It\'s a level win excitement kill.  I don\'t mind a few ads, but the amount in this game is to the point where it\'s borderline excessive.',

      'I absolutely love this game. It\'s so addictive and a really good game if your bored. I\'m really curious to find out what happens when you have collected all the balls, does the game just carry on or is their more challenges?? Overall, this game gets five stars from me üòö',
       'Its a really good game. The only thing is, that I wish there was maybe some instructions that appear at the beginning, because I didnt know that you couldnt hit the black lumps etc. Maybe if you add little phrases that say what to do and not to do, then it would be almost perfect.',
       'Great time killer I love everything about it and it is a great game to wake up to. The only down side is that you fall off the ledge and that makes it harder to dodge the black. Everything else is 5 stars so that is what I think about roller coaster.',
       'This game is amazing! It is addicting and fun to play!! The only thing is that I was hoping for some sort of introduction to the game, to tell me how to play etc. Also, I was hoping to be able to choose what kind of ball i use, the black one is plain and kind of boring. But overall its an amazing game!!',
       'Its really fun and addictive. Awesome game play and good for passing time. Not always so friendly to my battery and too many adds. Other than those little hick ups I absolutely love it.',
       'Loved everything about it! Only one thing, there are a few times you cant see where your going when the camera changes and you die sometimes because of it.' ,

      'I hope in the new update you can upgrade the engine and body kits as well. That would bring back the fast and the furious Season 7 track 6 nexts to be check it says three lap but you are basicly doing lap 2 twice and it says wrong way. Third lap starts when u finish three laps and doing 4th lap counts as 3rd lap. Needs to be looked at this is cheating  u guys are doing',
       'Fix the detection when you touch/hit in perfect drift mode. There\'s been hundreds of times where ive definately not hit and yet it ends. So Infuriating, love the game but that one detail could definitely be optimized better. The drift should not end unless you actually hit and it screws up your direction. 4/5',
       'I love this game and so do all my mates. It dose have a few light glitches as most games do. I would love a night track of some kind in the future but other wise great game all together. Also out of all the drifting games this is the best one at of all of them.',
       'Hey! Absolutely awesome game, dev! Ive been playing it daily now.. But id like to report some bug. On season7 career, perfect drift race on turini south, the game reads me in the wrong way when i was crossing the finish line. So the race would never finished altough the time is still decreasing. I need that 1 starr üò¢ Xiaomi Redmi 3pro',
       'Please fix the Turini-south perfect drift class A track in season 7. Lap count doesn\'t work properly, thus after second lap it remains the same, making impossible to save 8 seconds on the finish',
       'Great game. Takes getting used to but overall it\'s a great game to play!  It would be great to get more cars available and at the same time additional categories to upgrade like engine, weight reduction, etc.' ,

      'I can\'t help but love a mobile game that doesn\'t constantly shove advertisements in your face. No silly energy system to make you wait to play, and while it has a real money store, it\'s tucked away in a corner where it belongs. Different control options and simple, accessible gameplay make this a hidden gem. 5 stars all the way. Kudos to the developer.',
       'This game would be perfect if the controls were better. They are nonsense. Doesn\'t always shoot when I tap, jumping is crazy, and the game gives you multiple ways to control, but they are all garbage. Also would have appreciated a tutorial so I knew what I was doing',
       'Excellent game, can\'t wait for a new map. There isn\'t any tutorials but it\'s quite a simple and fun game, you will catch on quick just be patient. Hope to see new maps soon don\'t make it too easy on us high levels now : )',
       'I really like the game. But there\'s one thing that annoys me: when I don\'t play this game for a few hours and then I do another battle in dungeon, the game crashes after killing last monster in that battle.  I found out that if I switch on mobile data it works. So I wanted to asked why is that. EDIT: now all works just fine. 5 stars',
       'I really love this game, it\'s super fun, the graphics are simplistic but stunning, one thing I really hope for in the future updates is an ability to save data and be able to continue a game of a different device. I can\'t wait for the next level and weapons update! Edit: the feature I was hopping off was added 5 stars!',
       'Lots of work to do on this game. It\'s very SOLID in gameplay and possibilites, but lacks a lot of content. Needs to gather gold while away from the game, as the grind is tremendous right now! There is no purpose in leveling up your mine past lvl 5 right now. It doesn\'t do anything. The game is very incomplete, but has a ton of potential.' ,

      'Cool passtime. Several elements I recignize from series like Sid Meiers Civilization or the Settlers. The fights turn based combat. And the guilds are surprisingly helpful. The game offers some pay to win stuff but nothing you cant get with a little extra time. Nice game. 1 star taken because i have some issues launching it sometimes.',
       'Nice game, plays well. Only when you scroll the screen it keeps making a clicking sound if you touch a building doing so. Also, some free diamonds once in a while like in clash of clans would be nice. Give some free stuff then maybe people will be willing to spend some money',
       'The latest update "moved" Rogues from 1st on the list to "hidden" way back in the rest of the troops.  Very frustrating.   ALSO the fact that we can only "trash" or "use" rewards given to us in the Expedition.  Shows how worthless many of the rewards really are.  If we could sell them or trade them with others?  That would make them actually valuable.',
       'This game follows a typical progression. Early game moves fast so new players stick with game. Then there is a rapid slow down in the game where you either a. Spend real money to have anywhere close to the same sense of progression or b. Wait and wait and wait. Very quickly the game turns into logging on every 4 hours just to tap the screen a couple times and then exit. Eventually you won\'t play for a few days or maybe a week and then you log back on and tap the screen a few times and see that nothing has changed durring the week so you log off because you made no progress and are now bored. So you go delete the app and then write a review as honest as this one.',
       'The game is challenging and fun. Gave it 4 stars because you better not depend on the people who made the game. They are snotty and snobbish. They told me they couldnt be bothered to answer "basic" questions. The players have been super nice and helpful. The graphics are so, so amazing.',
       'I have seen the ads many times and just thought it was yet another ordinary game (pay-to-win).  However, I got curious and decided to give it a shot.  I started playing a couple of hours ago and I am hooked.  I am, literally, still playing it after starting...a couple of hours ago.  Very impressed so far and truly hope it doesn\'t turn out to be one of those games that loses its luster due to lack of resources and ends up requiring my hard-earned dollars.  Thank you for a great game and relaxing music.' ,

      'Love the game & love watching kwelbol. Hope to win the $1000 bcuz the game is simple. But my only question is, is it different on ios, Android & PC? I notice how in the video the character is able to keep rolling face down or the blocks move. Also in lvl 10 the first one falls. I figure how to pass the first 3 parts but it still bothers me how my guy doesn\'t roll like in the video. When I die its instantly puts me back  & its not even a sec and im back at restart. Great game thoe‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ',
       'I think it has potential to grow but the game breaks on level 10 because you cant get around the wall with the second you get to jump around it and then jump breaks so instead of this being a 30 second level make it a little longer from the start to make it possible. It also is WAY too sensitive on controls.',
       'There\'s not too much wrong with the game. But I started playing level 10 to see what is was like and after smashing into the wall for a while my jump button stopped working R.I.P. also the app asked for 4 permissions: contacts, location, make and receive calls, and access files on your device. The game required none of these permissions though, so if you could remove them that\'d be great.',
       'Kweb, I expected this gane to be FUN. The controls are way to sensitive and the respawn concept is comfortable. The game has RageQuit written all over it. I love you man but this game really is a major setback. And I have no idea about what\'s wrong with level 10. Have you played it yourself kweb?',
       'Good effort for your first game, level 10 is probably more realistically possible from a pc but definitely think it\'s possible with practice. I think there\'s a gap to add shooting or an attack to the game? I\'m guessing the orange character is based on you so possibly a green and or red avatar for some bad guys to attack?',
       'Awesome game jordi!!!!!  But one issue the controls are WAY to sensitive. üòØüòØüòØ Don\'t get me wrong jordi is fire‚ô®‚ô® But on level 3 it is really hard I beat every one until nine on PC and phone but level ten is impossible with these controls. BTW love your videos.  Keep it up' ,

      'Would be nice if there was a redo button for the last move. I\'m very quick when playing and I often misplace a block. Also, why does the Apple version have stars and the android version doesn\'t? I was trying so hard to earn enough stars to buy the colour packs on my iPod, and I got quite disappointed that I can\'t do that on android. I guess I\'ll just delete the game off android since there\'s really no goal to the game now.',
       'Kind of fun just trying to beat 1010. Played 5 times maybe and more than doubled the score that it says 1% get to..... not very fun after beating it. After the targets destroyed, what else do you aim for?',
       'Way too many ads. I just need something for my fingers to do while listening to podcasts but this constantly interrupts my listening pretty much after every round. I really liked the game but I have had it with thw ads and am uninstalling. It\'s just not worth it.',
       'I really like the game but as many others have said their are too many ads. Ads after every round and sometimes in the middle of the round which makes you start over and that gets annoying. Too many of thr same ads. I also agree their needs to be a redo button. It does get a bit pintle after you hit the goal but still fun.',
       'I\'m not quite sure what\'s happened to this game. It\'s very straightforward and strangely addictive. However, just today after Android\'s OS update, it performs much worse. Where before when you pick up a block, it is elevated slightly above your finger so you can see where it\'s going, now it\'s just under your finger, making this game frustratingly impossible. If this is due to an interaction with the OS update, then 1010 is due for it\'s own update.',
       'I still love this game but why did you change the colors!? It\'s so frustrating and confusing because the colors where just switched around. So I go to pit down a 4 block and realize too late it\'s a 5??' ,

      'If you\'ve liked the first game you\'re probably gonna enjoy this one. It\'s more dynamic and there are plenty more content. Unfortunately it\'s built around microtransactions so if you\'re feeling like expending some money things might get easier. I just don\'t understand how they  screwed the controls this much, it\'s likely you\'re going to try placing a plant more than three times before making it.',
       'Great game. Lots of fun. For those who aren\'t aware: Some levels are super hard to beat BECAUSE THEY REQUIRE UPGRADED PLANTS. Level up gives you something to do in the game expanding its lifespan. Level up is not that easy. Don\'t expect to end all levels Ancient Egypt with level 2 plants; level 3 or 4 are fine!',
       'I was unable to launch the game for some stupid reason.....i sent several messages to the developers email seeking help,but everytime i get a same reply,asking me to visit the ea gaamjng website. It doesnt work,and seems like the message the developer replied is auto generated. Does popcap/ea rlly take time to fix it? Pls help me,i dont wanna miss out on speacial events. Thanks',
       'EA doesn\'t care about the problems of the gamers. Im not interested anymore in this game after my profile has gone. 3-4 years of playing and buying stuff and most of my plants are in level 10 plus 4k+ gems, but with one stupid glitch, all of my achievements are lost. the game does not deserve even 1 star. I DONT LIKE TO PLAY FROM SCRATCH AGAIN & AGAIN. STUPID!!! u dont care about our feelings, all u want is money..',
       'You know, this game is about plants. And zombies. Its also about Battling through in an attempt to get those damn zombies off your lawn by using some damn evolved plants to shoot \'em down back to the ground in ancient egypt, the far future and many other times! Now go get crazy Dave that taco!',

      'I wish I could post pictures, but the game is too easy. I beat the first 2 levels both on one attempt. Though I am an experienced geometry dash player. But if I can beat a level first try, not knowing the course at all, that\'s some easy stuff. I highly recommend geometry dash sub zero though.',
       'I love every Geometry Dash version! And this one might be the best. But my only downfall is that the music, which is freaking awesome,gets ahead of the actual gameplay and I miss my jumps. Plz fix and I\'ll rate 5 stars! But keep up the good work!',
       'Great fun but needs more levels. I laughed when I saw a review made by an idiot because he said this was a copy of the Impossible Game LOL it\'s the other way around, dumbass.',
       'Hardly worth downloading. I love the full version of the game and figured this world be similar, or at least have some interesting levels, but much to my dismay it does not. The levels are easy and somewhat boring, which is unfortunate because Geometry Dash is usually neither of those things.',
       'I think it should be more easy it\'s kind of hard and RobTop Games can you plz ohh plz add more levels to try   ok so now I\'m even more upset it keeps on not jumping when I want it tooo!!! I will and I mean I will keep lowering the stars until you fix it!!! I am fed up with this but I will keep the app',
       'This is the worst game ever but it\'s so good even I have to pull my hair out of my face for it! It\'s the worst but the best at the same time! Even my mom plays it! And she doesn\'t have any games on her phone except this.' ,

      'I really enjoy this game, but I have found a flaw in the design. The game speeds up as you go and after a point it doesn\'t go faster, but after around 10,000 you notice the ball start to move forward on the screen and after about 20,000 you don\'t even have to move the ball to not die. It just misses the spikes. I know you might be thinking Its not on the leaderboards, but that\'s my next complaint. Im currently 6 on the leaderboards, but I\'ve gotten a better score and it won\'t update. I quite frankly destroyed that score and it doesn\'t show up. Thank you for your time and I hope this helped',
       'Game is great, far too many ads, after each level AND major issues with the videos giving rewards. I watched 4 and only received 1 reward which makes the game unfair and not worth playing.',
       'I think the game is good but the pop up ads make it almost impossible to play as when ever you about to start a new level pop up ads and some where even in the middle of the game and it happens to a lot of their games',
       'Fun game, but occasionally an ad will pop up while I\'m playing, causing me to mess up and die. I was having a really great run when an ad popped up. Not cool.',

      'I have only had this game for a few days, so I can\'t write a very comprehensive review just yet. But I have good feeling about this game. It is fun, challenging, with easy-to-learn controls. Less fast paced than Dragon SIM and less worlds and bosses. Customization is better though, and slower pacing may mean more long-term fun; not over so fast. Multiplayer is always a plus. Not pay-to-play, though paying gets you more benefits, it\'s up to you how you want to go about getting coins and acorns. Great game, few problems, would recommend.',
       'Hello, I absolutely love this game, it\'s very addictive. Recently though, it\'s stopped letting me go online. I have a strong internet and even tried using my mums but it has stopped working. I\'ve tried uninstalling the game and reinstalling it but it still won\'t work. I now can\'t play as my level 88 wolf because I am unable to connect to the server.',
       'On one of the quest, I think 11. There ia a syrange new animal and I went to the game menu for information and there wasn\'t any. It looks like a brown rabbit, I tried killing Rabbits squirrels and deer, but It wasn\'t the right animal! Is it in the snow biome?  Anyways hope you can help me and otger quest 11 users. It\'ll be great that when you get the same animal twice it counts as duplicate. For example "Wolf Common Duplicate +(however acorns). Thanks and the update is great!',
       'Thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you thank you for making this!!! I already installed it and I can\'t wait to play it!! Thank you so much TRG! (Turbo Rocket Games) üòÉüòÉüòÉüòÉüòÉüòÉüòÉ oh an one thing.. when your wolf is pregnant could everything be a lot slower & a lot weaker please? That\'d be great Thanks! üòÉ Oh, yeah also for the new game seasons, I\'m thinking.. Autumn & Summer! And I like how you can randomize the name! And for dog sim, I\'m thinking.. maybe Samoyed Husky & maybe Chihuahua! üòÄüòÄüòÄüòÄ',
       'Man i love this game!!! So much better than wolfquest!!! I do hope tht this game soon be added new things like more animal to play as, better in performance. The ad free guys...keep it up!!! Just wondering if there\'s a add as mate system in multiplayer in the future? Anyways....this is the best wolf game tht i played!!! Do hope tht you guys one day add more animals to play as (like a snow leopard for example)',
       'The best app EVER! You start as a wolf and than get a fox, than lynx! You can play online and get stronger! No dirty language, they will stop that speech, if more rudeness ban speech for a while, nonstop, banned from all multi! It makes it a clean and fun game as you can also play as a baby animal, when it\'s ready to grow you don\'t have to grow it right away, you just press a button to grow!    I encourage you to play this game and rate it too!' ,

      'Really fun.  But crashes constantly on my Galaxy S5.  Then I have to force stop the app, and restart my phone to get it working, for about 5 minutes....  All have to do to avoid ads is not restart until the respawn timer clears, so they aren\'t that bad, and it\'s really cheap to turn the ads off.  I would happily do so, it the app would run for more than 5 minutes.  If it wasn\'t for the crashing, I would rate it 4 stars at least.',
       'Love playing this game...very addictive! I would rate it 5* if there was a reason for why you level up and why you keep spinning for little lightening bolts when you do level up  as once you have bought the small amount on offer they are no longer needed. Add more things to buy and give the game a reason for levelling up ü§òüèº',
       'Smooth game. Plenty of fire ball options and endless level options but after every death you have to watch  15 second ad. EVERY DEATH. Which just spoils the experience and all. I understand ads but like after 3 deaths that\'s fine. But after every death and some are unskippable. So download of you have patience. It\'s worth it of you have time to spend',
       'A wonderful aesthetically pleasing game.  Get as far as you can, with as many points as you can while unlocking different fireballs and portals. I would love to see how this game evolves in the future and i have not seen as many ad\'s as people claim so perhaps that issue has been resolved? Working perfectly on S8+',
       'TOO MANY ADS, every time you die you get an ad and that\'s just being money hungry what ever happened to games without long ads what\'s the point if you\'re gonna make a game and 1/3 of the gameplay being ads. Perhaps every 10 or 20 games, or just have those small popup ads, but don\'t ruin the gameplay because you want money. I\'m uninstalling and I\'m sure other people are as well.',
       'I hate this game because it literally makes you watch ads every single time you finish, and doesn\'t reward you for it like some apps do. I would not recommend this at all, especially because when you close the app to try to skip the add, you open it back up and it says it\'s stopped running and closes itself again because you didn\'t want to watch the stupid advertisement. If I could give it 0 stars, I would!!' ,

      'Yes this is addictive, yes it\'s fun, and it\'s great because you can spend 12 seconds or 12 minutes on it and still get the same amount of enjoyment. BUT, and this is a very big but, this game is a HUGE drain on your battery. And no, I don\'t have an iPhone - I have a proper phone - a Sony XZ Pro. So it\'s not the weedy battery. No game I have ever played drains the battery away as fast as this game does, so it\'s clearly an issue that I wish they could fix.',
       'Everyone I know plays Cookie Clicker (CC), definitely too much. I absolutely refuse to play Cookie Clicker myself. I am not one to compete over single-player games, so I was looking for something similar, a game that none of my friends play. AdVenture Capitalist (AVC) fit the profile and is a simplified version of CC. I\'m not saying that AVC is more rewarding than CC, but it isn\'t nearly as convoluted. It\'s a simple game for those of us who want to minimize our time spent on phone games.',
       'Not having to have the screen open 24/7 is really good. Can check in on it when I have 2 minutes free and know I am still progressing. My only minus is that there isn\'t much information on how the Valentine\'s day event works',
       'IRRITATING!! Dont waste your money. Game is glitchy. You don\'t get the rewards you earn in events or their so called offer wall. Go ahead and try to contact them. They will blow smoke until you get frustrated enough to uninstall. Developers need some customer service skills.',
       'Nice idle game. The amusing special events are an interesting touch. Sadly the use of supersonicads for free premium currency spoils it greatly as supersonic ads far too frequently incorrectly claim "offer not completed" and then demand an impossible standard of evidence from you when you complain or sometimes just say the gold is awarded but it never appears and you have no recourse.',

It\'s also the best exchange rate on points. 3000 points equals $6 instead of like some of the others where it takes 3300 points to reach $1 etc....Also, TOYOCASH App is very reliable in paying you when you redeem to Paypal. You can choose assorted giftcards as payment or transfer to Paypal for cash. Your choice. I love these guys thanks for adding some fun to my day.',
       'Finally! For the the longest time I\'ve been waited, the gaming performance has been improved! No more annoying lag and the gameplay feel a lot smoother now and I am so happy about it. But the graphics still needs to be improved because it doesn\'t look too good and some minor bug needs to be fixed.',
       'Favourite Shark game in the entire world. I became obsessed because it\'s so addictive and fun. The graphics are amazing, disappointed when I got my new phone I lost my progress even when I used the smart transfer to transfer the app. I\'ve had to start all over again... but the fun continues!',
       'This game is really addictive and i love it but i own everything now so I don\'t play anymore. I occasionally get on just to check for new stuff and they do put out new stuff but it takes a long, loooonggggg time. Please put new sharks out and don\'t make us wait foreverrrr!',
       'It\'s a fun game and I\'m enjoying it. However, I\'ve come from Hungary Shark Evolution and find that the tilt controls in World are vastly inferior to Evolution. Is there a way they can be made more effective? As it stands, I actually have to bend over just to get my shark to swim to the surface. Not fun at all.',
       'Fun time waster, can get quite a lot sunk into it, and get e erything without paying up. Glad its always been grindable. Just has had trouble connecting for saves. I lost everything a couple years ago before they had cloud saves... They\'re here now and aside from a logout/in they are wonderous afaik. Good stuff!' ,

      'This game is kind of creepy... I was talking to a boy named Lucas and he asked "What is your last name?" Then I asked a girl named Jessica a question and she said "When is your birthday?" This game says it isn\'t looking for personal data but it is. It\'s not safe and it wants to learn more about people. I don\'t trust this game! Also if someone mentions \'Dr.Wallace" ask them who it is and then you will see what I mean.',
       'I think that this game is trash DO NOT PLAY THIS GAME!!first they won\'t even let me in the game but when I finally got in I couldn\'t even ride anything I built.snd I wanted to talk to but the people there are just robots!I know it sounds dum to say that but I am at my limit with this game.',
       'Best game ever you actually ride the slides and go in the pool and do more it does not tell you what you HAVE to do it tells you what things you CAN do and I love this game I never get bored. 5 star for me. I rec commend this game for you.üíô',

       'When i wanna have a map it keeps kick me out of the game and its working when i wanna go in the water slide its horrible because i canot slide when i wanna talk to fake people jessica said "hi how old are you?" So creepy This game really creepy. DO NOT INSTALL!!!!',

      'Was an awesome game Very addictive game! Was well done.. until the update. Needs more pens and new themes as I have thousands of coins but nothing left to unlock. Bugs: Pineapples that give you coins don\'t register as pineapple hits for the counters. There\'s a glitch where the fruit jumps to the opposite side of the screen. Graphics bite the big one though.. fix it',
       'Fun and addictive but... Very fun and addictive game except for the fact that it takes approximately 60.56 MB... an app this small (but still amazing) shouldnt consume that much of my space. Unless you have more items in the games files which will be soon added, but if its not that than Im... puzzled.',
       'Addictive  I play this game everyday when I wake up. I find it flawless, I have had no problems with this game, not even adds! The only thing I dislike is the title ( it did not effect my rate), why is it only pineapple pen? What happens to apple pen and PPAP? Anyway I love the modes and pens ( the surfboard is my fav pen) one again they are flawless. I think that Ketchapp is pure genius.',
       'Its good but nobody is changing the theme. Back to normal. Its still christmas. It seems like an abandoned game yet i think it was pretty popular among non ketchapp game players. If ur not going to keep up with the changing theme at least put it back to regular n take it off holiday.',
       'GREAT!... but the coins are a bit hard 2 earn thought the game is very addictive and the adds are not very frequent but they do appear on the bottom of your screen while playing thought there is a no adds purchase also the only purchase in the game the thing I like about the no adds purchase is that sometimes it will let you get it for 50% off so it is only one dollar instead of $2 (USD). The game has a lot of pens and I so far have unlocked a bit more than half and have played the game a lot of the game. But really needs an update.',
       'The games controls,  features,  graphic are really good and can\'t get your eyes off the screen once dart playing BUT, They are advertising companies that pop up there add moment we open the app... And whenever huge pineapple is on the move these things pop up please patch this immediately.' ,

      'I like the game very much. I bought the starter pack for a dollar 99 and removed ads. After the update came out, the one that and the ability to watch a video to double your rewards, your offline rewards, I click to watch the video and then the game sends me to the store to buy a gem pack. I click off of that and then it says the video is not available. I assume it wants me to buy another gem pack in order to enable that feature. I will not be doing that as that is ridiculous. I already bought the starter pack. Please fix this as the game is very fun and addictive.',
       'The game would be generally fun if it didn\'t shove an ad down your throat every 20 seconds,  and how about the tabs that want you to buy something for the app up constantly covering the screen from time to time.   If you enjoy ads popping up when you try to go to the menus DURING A TUTORIAL then by all means get this game.',
       'It was fun, but im slowly starting to hate it. One moment youre just looking at youre businesses and the next they are shoving ads down your throat. I shouldnt have to look at ads unless i get something in return.',
       'This game is AMAZING! With that said, heres the problem. Stop with the obnoxious freaking monkey!!!! Im sick of him popping up every 30 secs with no skip button. Ill be getting up a good tapping speed and it will jist ruin it by popping up with no option to click off. If i want to explore the game further, i will, at my own pace. I dont need you to hold my hand. Its really spammy and ruining the game play. Tutorial based gaming is a waste and a headache. Also its laggy. Please fix this. I LOVE this game and i want to play but the spammy monkey is a deal breaker.  Rant over',
       'taps to riches is a really good game with understandable controls constantly having events   and if you play this game you be the mastermind of the world. the richest person alive with a monkey as a partner greeting you when you come home from jail. : )',
       'Game is great. There an ad that keeps popping up for "Coin Masters" that wants nothing to do with closing. So I gotta force stop my game. Other than that great game' ,

      'They have fine a great job with this game. The dynamics, the playability, the graphics, and it feels as if you could never stop growing. Every bot is beast with a certain load out and play style.  Update! After playing for over 3 years, and over many different platforms this game rocks. It\'s definitely not the mech its the pilot kinda game. The balance is good so if you spend money and level quickly you\'ll be placed on your mechs rating(mech level + weapon level) so take your time and learn some tactics. Every gun has its purpose but it takes a good pilot to make them work.',
       'Game is designed to milk money out of its players. Fun to play. But $200 for a pretend robot or $100 for a single gun. Lower prices. You might be shocked more people can afford 20 than 200......reply- you think giving someone 15 pieces of a random bot that takes 2 games to earn if you place first out of the 10000 you need. Only real option they give is purchas. Don\'t be fooled. This is a pay to win game.',
       'I like how the game has gotten better over past year in many ways.. But could you guys quit making the puzzle peice stuff to get newest goodies? I get you added lots of cool ways to get extras that\'s cool and all.. But who wants 7 puzzle pieces out of 7,000? Not worth the effort. Keep it gold and silver guys!!',
       'I totally like the game and all but there must be balance between different robots especially..... some robots have a big advantage like the haechi with 3 medium slots and its dash ability.. its like u cant even aim at it......  Also please remove the components so that everyone is able to buy newer robots... u can make them available in gold or silver or even workshop points',
       'Huge pay to win. Takes patience with a DNA lab which is a nice feature. Save up enough and you can use that purchase some good robots. Very fun game, expect a lot of losses to better bots and weapons unless you want to spend like 60$ per robot and weapon. Only downfall.',
       'This game was great until about 5 days ago, that is when it started to take 4 to 5 minutes loading time for each game mode to start. Now my attention span prevents me from waiting that long to play one game. What happened game developers?.... !!UPDATE!! Okay it must have just been the servers. Because they\'re back up and running at 32 seconds loading time for a war. This game is great. I can dig it can you dig it' ,

      'I love the game. From its cute and addictive style to its unique and original dress up gameplay, it turned me from a dress up hater to lover. But I feel like there\'s a Paywall especially during events, and diamonds are forced to be bought, but they can be earned, which is good. But so far, you seem to have listened to feedback, from the skin tones to the bug fixes. But I love it still.',
       'In depth in both gameplay and attention to details of awarded items. Continuous hours not required but with once a day of incentive activities. Controls are  sometimes unstable. If a glitch does happen, its fixed fast and your also awarded for time spent. Very happy customer. Enjoyed the best dress up game I\'ve played so far. Thank you makers!',
       'I had seen many ads for it and was kind of interested, but I didn\'t think a dress-up game could be that fun. One day I couldn\'t find any games I wanted to play, so I decided to give it a shot. To my surprise, I am really enjoying it! So if you\'ve had any inkling of interest in this game, give it a shot. You might enjoying as much as I have.',
       'I love this game. I don\'t really like these types of games but to my surprise I like this one. I have a suggestion, may you please allow the hairstyle double pony tails to be dyed into a dark purple (like the reddish purple colour you can dye the ace hairstyle)',
       'I love it... I know I\'m not the age range who gets into dress up but God I love this... also can you make the the events a little easier I know you want paying people but I don\'t  A. Have money B. Or a credit card  So in all its kind of hard for me to get anything as my parents think it\'s a waste of time... and it probably is but you know it just is so fun and the stories cute to...',
       '*LOVE IT!*  Awesome game. Just one question though. Why did you change some of the names? \'Bobo\' was \'Yoko\'. \'Haru\' is now \'Bai Jinjin\' , and her boyfriend is now \'Zhong Lizi\' . To be honest, I just don\'t understand. I absolutely love this game, though. Please note. However, I did uninstall it because AVG told me that it had malware?' ,

      'Bought all the babies when I first downloaded the app. Everything was working great. So when the most recent (3) babies were available for purchase I bought them, but now those babies don\'t work!.... I\'ll give five stars when you get them to work. In the meantime, I think I should get a refund on my money.',
       'I would like to give a better rating, since my 3yld loves this app.  But the newest babies are not working and there is no support on the Disney app page.  Would love to get this issue reported and fixed before they try to screw everyone over with 3 more dolls that freeze the game.',
       'My daughter loves this game and plays it all the time. I just bought her all of the last babies today for her to have them all and the bottle freezes and she can\'t play with her new babies. If someone could fix this for me or refund me that would be great. I just got 6 new babies and she can\'t use any of them which is ashame cause she loves this game.',
       'Bought the game early on, then after an update with new babies they mixed the new babies in.  So you are left with a child constantly wanting the new babies.  A horrible money grab.  Otherwise a fun game.  Shoyld not show the locked babies mixed in with purchased ones.',
       'Dang, I wish the purchases I made on 6 more babies for my daughter would just work! She loves the app, but gets frustrated that the whole app freezes when she clicks to play one of the other babies. Wouldn\'t recommend this app because of that... it\'s just stealing my money..',
       'Like the others have mentioned - good game, daughter loves it but bought the 3 new babies and now itnjust freezes any time she tries to select them. Waste of ¬£1.59 or however much they were and no means of refund or correcting it.' ,

      'Game is fun until you get so far and can no longer upgrade to compete.  I have all stars in amateur league, yet on achievement rewards it shows I only have 1 star.  This is a problem to try to earn stars to purchase higher end cars, you can\'t without spending money.  Should be anle to earn all cars if you play regularly withput spending money.',
       'Good time waster. Especially well made in the beginning levels, but quickly becomes pay to win, as diamonds are not easily attainable and neither are coins, not to mention that later cars are very high prices and require much dedication to acquire. Controls are nice, but like with money, get worse with time. Maps are not optimized for later leveled cars, making some corners physically impossible to make even when drifting at full tilt, forcing the player to adapt to a combination of drifting, boosting and then braking to get around a bend without crashing. Otherwise, it is a very nice game for being free, although there are many ads, but that\'s excusable as it is a free game. I would recommend it, just not as a long term type of game.',
       'Update: so I\'ve been playing for several weeks now. You cannot win with maxed out mods, racing the same level cars. They\'re twice as fast and you can only knock off 3 cars at the beginning of the race and you\'re unable to catch with others. Even if you spend money, you will not get 1st place in a lot of the races. Very unbalanced game. Whoever programmed the ai should be fired  Fun game, but the intrusive ads are ridiculous. It pops up in the middle of a race, before and after the race, finished off by asking you to pay to remove ads.',
       'Nice game at first, my gf got angry at some point because I played it the whole time. However, I soon started playing less and less, because winning just became impossible. I respect the developers, but I wont pay to max out a cars modifications just to race that same car which is twice as fast. How does that work? Are the AI cars getting modifications from a different game?',
       'The controls is very floaty like your car is late responding when tilted and i really like that this game is very fun and time wasting but it lacks car selection very small but i know it will add soon. And i thought the pic is real but it is not even the same on the game for its originality that all thanks',
       'So many ad\'s, there back to back ad\'s. When I am finally able to select a race, guess what...another ad pops up and takes me to the play store to download it. I go back to the game and I gotta start all over again from the first screen. Ad\'s ad\'s ad\'s I was only able to play on the first day I downloaded it, after that..... Ad\'s ad\'s ad\'s                    "AD\'S!!!".... But i did like the game when I played it' ,

      'I mean the game in itself is......alright  it could be a lot better.  I think the controls are rubbish and I understand it\'s meant to be "skillfull" but thats harder than skillfull, you can\'t even see where the circle is, this also adds to the game being bad. Having said all this you have also added rubbish music..... like you could have put something decent on. I get even more of an urge to uninstall the game every time I play it. Overall I definitely do NOT recommend this game. Game developers I hope you read this as it will probably help you to make the game better. I understand it would take a while but I don\'t care. If any of the game developers want to feedback on my feedback you are welcome to.Thank you.',
       'This is game is ok if you are bored and don\'t know what to do.... however it becomes irritating after playing for a while.... overall its a nice game',
       'I would like to report a bug. When you pause the game, moving obstacles keep moving. Someone would use this as a cheat',
       'This is the best game to relax. But i have a problem i do i change the music there are some music that i like and i want only that to play so i request ro put a music option  Thank you',
       'It\'s ok because the controls are horrible I say that this game is very annoying and that you should not play it if you are stressed because it will irratate you even more it is an ok game if you are bored and do not know what to do',
       'It\'s a good game not that much ads great controls and concept people just rage and rate it bad. keep up the good work' ,

      'Decent game but why are there so many rings? I mean literally I have 1000s and the only thing it seems you can spend them on is upgrading your characters. This nesitates you having other pieces for each character which take ages to get then when you finally have enough of those bits it\'s like 1000 rings to upgrade them... Which is absolutely nothing... Give me something else to spend them on or up the price for upgrading characters... Obviously.',
       'I enjoy the game--very much in the vane of classic sonic racing games, with a lanes mechanic and some mariocart-esque abilities. The micro transactions speed up game play and can help progress your character, but won\'t make up for being a bad racer. Instead of transactions you can often watch ads. Typically, the ads are a fair trade off, but some are nearly game breaking. An Airbnb one is running right now that cannot be exited after watching on my OnePlus 5.  Otherwise, 5 stars.',
       'An addictive game that never gets old. With the unpredictable players and teir upgrades, there is always a challenge. I have a few friends who play this game, and while it\'s fun to watch them, being able to play against them would be amazing. Also, the graphics for me are a bit janky (the device is fairly new) and isn\'t pleasing to the eye. The smoother, the better, like chocolate.',
       '*Sega does it again*  I am really happy about this game! Some may not like it, which could be reasonable, but I love it. It\'s fun, fast gameplay with killer music. I\'m very happy that they made this game the way they did. I was skeptical about it, I\'ll admit, but was very pleased with the results. It doesn\'t have all the super fancy bells and whistles, which is good. It\'s simple menu and play system is very easy to get a hang of. People who played the first, or even the second sonic dash can get the controls down. I am very pleased on how easy it is to get characters and level them up using a simple card style, collect a certain amount to unlock and upgrade, instead of the DREADFUL wheel in Sonic Runners.... *shudder*  Anyway, it\'s a very good game and the only problem I have is I enjoy it too much....',
       'Very enjoyable play on the Sonic Dash formula and the microtransactions aren\'t as obnoxious as they could be. Occasionally get a loading screen bug that necessitates force quitting and restarting. There are so issues with certain sound effects playing even when SFX is muted and when connected to a Bluetooth speaker all sounds play even when muted.',
       'Yeah great game and all but trophy system is unfair. Also a big bummer is that the game keeps crashing, sometimes even before u have entered the game. Cannot start a new match cos you are still racing in a match u never actually even entered. And due to this u now have lost 1 of ur reward star runners goes... Disappointed!' ,

      'I really like the concept of this game. Unfortunately I am not prepared to even give it one star as it doesn\'t take you long to realize that the only aim from this game is to extract money from all who wish to play. Pitiful really as there are many similar games available which you don\'t have to feel pressure to buy',
       'The game is very fun, but I only get to play one or two hands before I have to wait another hour to get more credits to play. Would be a lot better if you got more credits for wins or had free play. I\'m not spending money to buy credits. Also, it would be great if there was an option to turn off the fancy card movements; I get motion sick from it.',
       'Its great game love that I don\'t need Wi-Fi to play it. But some of levels just get so impossible to beat you spend four day on one level. Make the crops pay out more and levels make them a bit easier make the challenges be the hard ones.',
       'Great game concept, great graphics, however it really sucks that the amount of coins required to play  increases too much and you don\'t get enough coins. I wish it didn\'t cost so much to play, it seems like they just want you to actually buy more coins. No thanks. Will be deleting.',
       'way better than other solitaire games ive played! super fun, easy to navigate, and although you have to use a currency (credits) to play each game, you\'re never on the brink of bankruptcy, and there are ways to earn it without playing. really awesome game!!!',
       'Gambling trap...don\'t waste your time. Gorgeous graphics pull you in, then the app won\'t allow you to finish your game without forcing you to buy more points, etc. A complete waste of time. It is NOT "free." I felt very deceived.' ,

      'Fut can not be developed with this building team. Football is one of the most attractive games but how this fut goes? In Vs attack mode, what the hell meaning do chances have? Players must creat chances by themselves not the game. You must let them play whole game and create the chances by themselves. EA is a big builder in football games and develop a lot but have you ever thought how your fut only stands at this place?',
       'overall its an awesome game great experience. but Its hard for free to play players to complete and go through the events..... the icons are too difficult to get please make them a bit earlier to get, it will be awesome to have them in the team.... its difficult to get elite players in a pack of 500 fp totw pack n few others packs too... the vs attack mode is great.... EA please make sure that the free to play players to get a good experience of getting new and better players....',
       'Dear EA Sports: We really want to get the icon Ronaldinho but its changed and its very hard. Before we were required to have an 89 ovr+ team with atleast 5 Brazilian players but now it has completely changed. Now we are required to have a 98 ovr+ team with atleast 6 Brazilian players. I hope you make the icons a bit more easier. Thanks‚ò∫',
       'Pretty good game overall. The down side is that the matchups are truly awful.  90% of the time you go up against a team that\'s stronger than you & in this game that means a TON.  Better teams have better players of course, but it\'s not just that, the better teams get more chances and better chances making it extremely unfair.  If only they\'d fix that it would be close to a 5* game.',
       'Very fun game. I don\'t find it hard to get good players because the events are very good. Only changes I would recommend is to make the fans won/lost similar each time. It really sucks when I win a tense match and I only get around 5,000 fans. Oh, and don\'t get me started on the goalkeepers. They all definitely take steroids because they have inhuman abilities. And today, in a VS Match, I scored 3 goals but the results said I scored none! Nonetheless, very good game, enough to give 5 stars on. I have a 93 OVR team in Legendary III and I can\'t wait to improve and become a great player.',
       'FIFA Mobile is a awesome game and I have a good team after a few weeks with the events that they given it makes it easy to get coins.The only problem is I can\'t create a league. Plz fix this it is holding me back because I can\'t get me mobile master xp for Ronaldo Overall great game.!!!!' ,

      'Great game if you wanna run low graphics for a smoother gameplay on your phone. 40 instead of 100 is great for mobile games as well. Maybe make the controls a tad bit larger for default size. Otherwise really fun. Maybe add a first person mode? Unless I haven\'t found out how to haha. Great game. I seemed to like this one out of all the others tbh.',
       'Good game, but after the last update the game game is riddled with bugs and glitches, making the game next to unplayable. Will often come up with queue error and kick me from the game and the screen constantly freezes. I can move, but I can\'t pick anything up and my teammate position is also frozen. Pls fix or I will uninstall. Also, you got rid of the aim button which sucks. Was way better before the update. You\'ve ruined the game for meüò≠üò≠üò≠',
       'One of my favorite games at the beginning.. Ever since the Last 2updates Been facing Problems almost every single Game.Can only run and open Doors can\'t Pick any Weapons.. Sucks I hope y\'all Fix This or Its Time to uninstall this',
       'I honestly liked the game better before the update. You got rid of the aim button, the game is full of glitches like taking damage inside the safe zone, and I get lagged out all the time even though I have a pretty good Wi-Fi connection. To be honest,  you kinda ruined the game.',
       'This game is good and very challenging but i dont like the new update. My overall Stats have stopped working and im still dyeing even when im in circle and the aim button needs to come back it is so hard to play without it.  But overall a good game it just needs a few adjustments.',
       'Okay, why are servers lagging lately? I got killed multiple times because of that! And the glitch where you can\'t pick up items and get damage in safe zone as well, glitches have returned and fix them plz. Also, bring back aim sight! Edit: Ugh, how many times do I need to die because my auto aim didn\'t activate and enemy one did? Bring back aim button, please!' ,

      'Amazing game. Me and my friend spend hours on it. I get to shows him my mods. He has none though we both have completed the levels. The game NEVER AND I REPEAT NEVER gets boring. Definitely better than the angry birds series must download. The only problome is the metal flap things don\'t work correctly. They just float in midair.Apart from that  Please make a new selection of levels. My life depends on it!!!!',
       'The game and level desgins promote and foster a great degree of creastive thinking. With very unique mechanics and obstacles that actually require thought and consideration when building. It has great art, along with many bonus levels and content. Fun game overall but level experiences do wildly vary sometimes. From simple to extremely  difficult, sometimes you win by mer luck and not strategy. Along with all that I don\'t know if anyone else experienced this but the levers on lvl6 were buggy and never worked. All in all good game to play.',
       'FIX THE ROAD TO EL PORKADO I swear this is frustrating to the point of unplayable. No, those levels ARE unplayable. They cannot be done with this platform glitch at all. Also, sometimes in sandbox mode when I click the tick it disappears when it hits the ground. Occasional and not as game breaking or frustrating as the moving platforms not working but still',
       'Generally great, but destroyed by graphics/world modeling glitches that render levels impossible to complete! Generally involving trap doors that aren\'t in the right place. Frustrating. AND the new cake race won\'t unlock rewards- 24000 hrs to go apparently so I can\'t play more levels.',
       'I would give it a higher rating, but on those levels like 6-18. The button activated doors and platforms don\'t work right and they glitch out. I\'ve been able to get through a few levels without the doors but on 6-18 you can\'t complete the level without this door working. Please get this fixed',
       'I don\'t  understand why people complain about ads and call Rovio money hungry. If may be a "free" game but really nothing is completely free. Developers deserve to get paid. It costs to have a game. Free games have ads just like TV. And you don\'t have to make the in-app purchase. GO buy a game.' ,

      'Annoying vibrations !! The vibrations wen \'being phoned\' is annoying especially if u are as addicted as me and play it at night. They are so loud and I have to stop playing at night and in the day because of the vibrations can u add in a feature in the settings that enables u to turn them off!! Except from that this is the best game ever and I ADORE it!!',
       'Why do u have to pay just to see the picture and the videos? What\'s the point to that? U want us to be addicted to it but some of us can\'t buy it for a reason. Please update this and think about it. I know it\'s a low payment. It u want more people to install it. Please consider this thank u!!',
       'Personally I think the stories are a bit cheesy and there\'s very limited interactivity. Some of the stories I played had no interactivity at all. You have to pay to see photos or videos in the game, which is fair enough, but I wish the game had a set price or charged a small amount for each story. A weekly subscription fee is  too much for me. There is a free 3 day trial though.',
       'Love all of the stories on there, loads of mysteries and some good plot twists. Annoying that you have to pay to see pictures or listen to audio stuff but I just imagine what it\'s like but amazing work',
       'This game is fun, but I did not pay for  the pics because I have no money and plus i do not want to see it as it may be scary. I also did not answer the video calls and the calls because no money and scared to answer it...',
       'First off, unless you want to pay, don\'t play. If you don\'t pay monthly, you will not be able to watch videos, answer calls or video chats, or look at pictures. üòí You also can\'t skip the fifteen minute wait that pops up every 15 texts or so üòµ, and you won\'t be able to get coins. Coins allow you to make certain choices, usually the smarter ones that help you win the game. And while we\'re on the topic of choices, you only make about 2-3 per chapter for each story. Sometimes, you can\'t even make a choice. For more than half the stories, you just read and wait for the people to die. I mean, the concept of the game is great, but ‚Ñπ bet that some mediocre app designer could make a new app that is twice as good. üòä I would try it, but paying probably isn\'t worth it. It\'s a great idea(the concept of a choose your own adventure text story, that is), but the app itself is pretty trashy. Its still fun, just not worth the money. üòã I know that most of the reviews say that this app is great, but it\'s not really that amazing.' ,

      'Love the story lines, the graphics, all of it. Would have liked to seen something that can be done to regenerate the diamonds or do something to earn more diamonds other than finishing a new chapter earns you only one. Did experience my diamonds disappearing and the timer of keys along with the keys reach zero and not returning. Hope this issue will be resolved. Other than these issues really enjoyed the game, it\'s highly addictive.',
       'I\'ve been playing this game for a few days, so here\'s my review. I enjoy the stories even though they use a lot of archetypes, and I don\'t mind waiting for keys. The biggest issue I have is with the gems and premium choices: not only do the premium choices cost an unreasonably high amount of gems, but every time there are choice options with at least one premium choice, the premium choices are always presented as the better ones. This is less like making my own choices and more like reaffirming my assumption that the premium choices are always the better ones. I\'ve come to the conclusion that I would rather pay once to have this app installed rather than install it for free and pay money for gems just so I could pick the premium choices.',
       'I absolutely love this game. i just wish the diamonds and keys werent so expensive. Nobody has $100 to spend on a game. $10 lasted me like 1 day smh...and i have to wait 2 hours everytime i play 2 chapters so please fix that. thats soooo annoying. Id rather PAY for the game once and have unlimited diamonds or please  make the diamonds much much CHEAPER....also itd be cool to make the characters move or place them in the actual scenery in the future.',
       'After reading The Freshman and Most Wanted (which were my favorites, btw), I really couldn\'t sleep! I really loved the stories. Can\'t wait for the second books to come out. Well done, Pixelberry, well done. UPDATE: I really like some of the new books that came out... But I\'m still looking forward to Most Wanted\'s second book more than anything...',
       'Great game but it sucks you have to pay for all the decisions that will help your quest the creators of the game should allow us some good decisions without having to pay for them my story is not going the way I would have liked it cause I cannot afford 5 dollars every decision its outlandash! Give us something, I didn\'t pay the first ten times you asked I won\'t pay now give us a way to earn diamonds stop being so petty',
       'I paid for diamonds which disappeared once I used both keys I had available not happy at all. Diamonds can\'t be earned in any way either. Controls are dead easy story lines are good. Although you only release 1 chapter which takes 20 minutes to complete max per week not enough to keep me hooked and I\'ve stupidly spent over ¬£100 buying diamonds.' ,

Additional to that i saw therr locked 200 diamonds i clicked one of that and all my 420 diamonds gone and onlu 220 diamonds left and its showing me 2 big circle white and pink.. that\'s not fair....',
       'Found a game called "Infinite Balls" on my friend\'s iPhone, we loved it. This is the best Android alternative we could find, but it\'s not quite as satisfying. Balls are never randomized, there are no circular objects for the balls to bounce off from and neither an infinite mode. Also you  have to get used to the controls. Would be nice to turn off the help lines, too.',

      'This should be labeled as a demo. Subscription is a bad idea, and "lifetime" price is far too high. It looks nice, but that doesn\'t make up for the lack of content. A way to earn unlock points, even if slowly, would probably encourage more players to stay. The actual game is all right, but the rest makes it not worth it.  By the way, the image on the app store of a cat puzzle shows hints that don\'t at all match up with the apparent solution.',
       'I love this game! It is so addictive. A great mix of process of elimination and logic. There is a bit of a glitch sometimes when you press the button to watch a video for a free hint, the screen sometimes goes black and you have to completely shut down the game which means you have to use more energy to go back into the paused level. It would be good if you only had to use your energy lightning bolts one time only.',
       'Fun little game. I\'d love to do more puzzles than energy allows, but despite how cute this is, it isn\'t a $5 a month game. Sub too expensive. Pay once option is nice, but about $25 too much for this game.',
       'This one doesn\'t tell you when your wrong, also doesn\'t black out number sequences you have already completed in a row. Frustrating.',
       'I really enjoy playing this game but there is a slight glitch!! Some of the times when I opn the game it is nothing but black screen and if my tablet gets turned, it also becomes a black screen. I have to close down the game.',

      'Stupid game. I spent so much time on it building just for a higher leveled person to come in a destroyed it to point i couldnt rebuild. Not worth time spent on rebuilding things if higher leveled people just continuously attacking lower leveled teams and wiping them out. Only shows u have to have money to play this game to level up to defend. Im not spending a dime on this retarded game',
       'I\'m impressed. This really is a fun game. And with all of the aid, events and rewards there are you really don\'t need to pay to win. There\'s a lot to learn so you may feel a bit lost at first but it keeps the game from being repetitive. I didn\'t think this would be a 5 star game but after 2 weeks of playing I can tell you that it certainly is. A+ üíØ',
       'Great graphics and addictive but not alot of explanation on how to do things. Too many updates in short amount of time,  too long of a waiting time on researches. You need to spend money if you want to keep up with the rest and you\'re placed up against players alot more stronger so always have to go protection buffs. Not an even playing battlefield.',
       'A whole lot of effort to get anything done. They\'re constantly trying to sell you things at obnoxious prices and if you don\'t buy them you\'re setting yourself up to be abused by those foolish enough to waste their money on this game.',
       'Really not happy I have spent loads off money over time on buying gold in the game and packs.. I have had major glitches in the game that have made it a waste of my time and money I have lost over 10 advanced teleports on the game and when I contact your customer service team they don\'t even reply to me.  I find this very bad customer service and that all u want to do is take my hard earned money and not even reimburse me what I have lost.i really enjoy playing this game but this is making me want to not play any more',
       'Money hungry is all this game is. Can\'t upgrade buildings unless you spend tons of money. Have never played a game where you can not upgrade by waiting awhile. Don\'t waste your time.' ,

      'Graphics were generic until now for x86 devices. Thanks for that update. And that moving data to sd card, it is really appreciable since now a days even 32 gb  not sufficient. Hope other game developers get inspiration from this. And downloading just updated part is also an improvement instead of downloading whole data again. 4 stars because this game just wont allow to play older version once it finds out new version is present.',
       'Best driving and racing game on the net. There is so much you can do, it not just " drive a car on a track and try to win", in this game you can choose your path on the track, perform unbelievable stunts and trick\'s, take out other players and cars.  The game play is absolutely great and the graphics are f***#&@ awesome, the only step to fallow in the graphics is realistic and their close to that now, love the game, the only thing I would change is I would make it easier to get car\'s, now the bikes and car packs instead of having to work really hard to get them or spend a lot of real money, granted the real money goes to development of the graphics and game, I would like to be able to get the car and bike packs a little bit easier. Definitely a winner, ü§©',
       'Asphalt 8 airborne is a very exciting game to play. The addition of bikes is mind blowing. Wish all time limited events could be on mobile data rather than wifi. Thumbs up gameloft for an exciting game. After the recent update of this app it keeps crashing with a pop-up message "unfortunately asphalt 8 has stopped working". Please fix this issue.',
       'Munich update completely ruined what was previously the best driving experience on mobile. EDIT: Fall Out Boy update basically makes me unable to play the game altogether, with the game constantly freezing at the Gameloft splash screen. Talk about letting the junior devs do all the work unsupervised...',
       'They fixed commercial black screen bug. Now i can play normal again. Wish longer time for events and R&D, because of work i dont have enough time to play. Money rewards sucks. You cant buy cheapest part from one 24h event. If you spend real money, you are way above evryone else. Also, slow cars are useless. There must be better way for multiplayer ranking.',
       'As racing games go, this is probably the best. The graphics, sound, gameplay are excellent. Race solo, against friends or the world. The variety of ways to race is big. The selection of cars and now bikes, keeps getting bigger. The only down side is buying something from the shop or on offer. I purchased a special offer and never got it. They got my money, I never got the goods. Trying to get in contact with them is a joke. All replies to my emails were automated responses telling me to do the same thing over and over again.' ,

      'It\'s a good game.  Three things I may add.  Every so often when you improve a ship , the app goes "improvement failed" yet but takes your coins. Bit frustrating. Secondly, the matchmaking can be at times frustrating too, you\'re getting wrecked in seconds by other very powerful ones.. And last thing , hey , the music of the game becomes straight boring and dull after a while. Add something , anything , Frank Sinatra  ffs , you got about 15 seconds of soundtrack in all this game..',
       'The games great over besides the lack of game modes. One major problem I face continually is that people are getting modified versions of the game with everything maxed out. They all go by the name player####. If you could remove them all that would be appreciated.',
       'I like this game!  Feels like actual space combat and the correct style of combat.  Leveling seems little slow, hopefully there\'s lots of different weapons to upload and upgrade.',
       'This game is very impressive!!üòé Needs a Ticket too see why the com. Link to world chat was working before the update todayü§î And need more people to come join this Amazing! Game! Please guaranteed if you like this type of space game it won\'t be disappointing! Come On Pilots!! We need Ya!! Cause I know you\'re out there & Up for the Challenge!!üòéLock & Load!!üòéüòé‚úå',
       'I bought the Admirals Package and now my ships cannot equip the superheavy weapons.  Despite having several of these guns, the inventory shows as empty.',
       'See, this game is actually very well put together. I got it and played with it for a while and I came up with two problems; one personal and one problem with wording.  See, it\'s certainly easy to control, which is usually a good thing. That\'s because this is either non-newtonian physics, or it isn\'t actually space. (Take your pick) there isn\'t roll or pitch, just forward, back, up, down, and yaw (turning left and right.) And for my style that\'s extremely simplistic. Coupled with the fact that if I center all the controls I will stop instead of keep drifting as I should.... "Realistic 3D combat."  Anyways, the wording problem I had; This actually said something about direct control over all ship systems. So here\'s all the systems you control; move, shoot. And guess what! Half the guns fire themselves when locked-on, so that\'s over a quarter of your control gone.  Furthermore, this game would lead you on to think they\'re super customizable. Negative. They\'re customizable, but it\'s nothing extraordinary, in fact par for me.   TL;DR: This Is a great game if you\'re looking for a casual experience. if you\'re serious, or a simulator person, look elsewhere.' ,

      'Purchasing the other ponies is worth it. Don\'t know why other people are complaining. It\'s only 5 dollars, you could get a DQ lunch for 5 dollars. Anyways, game is amazing. What\'s cool is that you can reset your progress so you can have fun all over again. Amazing work Budge Studios!',
       'This game is my 5 yr olds favorite thing to do during trips. She loves the music and animation, and the gameplay is entertaining enough to keep her engaged. It\'s definitely worth the few bucks to get the add free version.',
       'Pay to play mechanic. Seems rather predatory for a game targeted for younger CHILDREN. Not to mention the constant barrage of ads that can only be removed by paying for ponies which shouldn\'t be EA\'d. Outside of that the game is enjoyable but the paywall issue is a problem. Devs... you should feel bad about yourself.',
       'Installed it, launched it, after the bungie screen was presented by a full screen ad for some game involving a woman + handcuffs + panties. Not a good look for a game aimed at children, my 6 year old was standing behind me.',
       'Remove the paywall and just charge for the game, it\'s worth it and people will buy it. But the way you can\'t unlock ponies without paying is insulting. Such a shame... I\'ll be sure to avoid any games you make in the future. And, yes, that\'s a bit harsh. But if we all don\'t stop letting devs get away with this kind of thing every company will turn into EA and will ruin the fun of gaming.',
       'I had purchased the $4.99 to unlock all the ponies for my daughter, but all of a sudden they became locked again and saying I need to purchase then when I have already. Very disappointing.' ,

       'ABSOLUTE RIP OFF & TOTAL RACKET.  When they see you purchase continuously, then you stop purchasing . You are unable to get any free tickets. They want you to spend more money. Uninstall & reinstall doesn\'t help. AND...Customer service sucks.',
       'Good game overall, touch screen controls are a bit dodgy, for example I try to scroll down the list of players I\'ve played with and it selects one sometimes. Also I can\'t change my profile photo, it always gives me an error message. Please fix that!!',
       'It was a good game until they updated it, now get a song wrong and you get a hideous scream played loudly...Why did you feel the need to put this stupid feature in ? Also the ads, yes i know its to help fund the game and development - but stupid ads like 93% sure you would love Epson or some other brand product. Shameful product placement   Update... For some reason playing on the Google pixel c tablet has rotation issues. Game plays in portrait mode, which is fine but the adverts often switch to landscape mode which after watching the same advert often won\'t go back to portrait making it impossible to play',
       'Great game but that bullying Ad from \'Wish\' almost. made me uninstall. ive installed wish but it still appears and wont move off the screen. i end up having to close the game because i now have no way past the Ad because i already own the app????',
       'Love the game. My only gripe is that in the past two days I\'ve completed and won two badges but the badges weren\'t uploaded and just disappeared. They were current badges so should have been applied' ,

      'The game was great until they put the ads on there, there are too many and 90% of the time I try to "x" out of one, it takes me to the play store anyway, and the game freezes a lot more now. It\'s also frustrating you can\'t alter the decorations. Game needs some improvements, and I hope they address them because it\'s quite fun to play.',
       'I am so disappointed in this game due to the fact my 3 year old somehow bypassed my password and spent 79.99 on coins!!! I sent a message immediately to Google play and the developer and I was told it doesn\'t meet the refund requirements. WTH?!! So frustrating! üò°',
       'This game would be a whole lot of fun IF there weren\'t so many ads! My niece is not patient enough to wait for stupid ads to finish, and u can\'t play the game until the ad is finished! Very disappointed!',
       'Love this game. Super fun but how do you get rid of ads? I paid for coins yet i still have ads. This is highly annoying especially if i can\'t skip them. Still love the game just not the ads :(',
       'Hate this game... been stuck on this one level...there is no way to win it... I had 12 free lives...used them all and still didn\'t pass the level...stressing me out..time to delete game...NOT PLAYING ANYMORE üò†',
       'Ahh I think it\'s a pretty good game. This is the 1 st time I\'m giving my review. I loved the game.I\'m.now in lvl 179 this game is fantastic but the lvl r so hard as we increase our lvl. This game have a good graphics, game, control n plz make more this kind of games' ,

      'The graphics aren\'t the best and the set up isn\'t totally comprehensive. Some maps are so zoomed in that it\'s hard to recognize the general location unless you\'re already really familiar with geography. It could be more interesting, but the questions are good and it has helped me learn some.',
       'I\'m extremely impressed by your app. It is not only fun, but it is the best educational app that has taught me so much! The border outline is the only thing that needs better graphics...otherwise I couldn\'t be happier!!! (An offline mode would make this app perfect) . Thank you!üôãüíØüí°üëç‚ùóüå†üèÜüíù‚ò∫',
       'Was a great game, I learned a ton of geography. But now the ads are seriously out of control. Top players are really the ones who watch the most ads. Also, it would be nice if the encyclopedia allowed you to compare countries for a given category instead of only being able to view a single country.',
       'The graphics/fonts and everything are outdated, but there is SO much information you can be quizzed on. I\'m learning everyday!',
       'Good game, but could someone help me? I don\'t know where to ask anywhere else. I\'m a level 32 and I have changed my phone. Now it asks for my user ID, which apparently isn\'t the same as my user name, which I know. Where could I retrieve it? I\'d hate to start over.',
       'It is challenging and does exercise the brain! I do find the format a bit confusing and the categories misleading (e.g. questions about Africa under "Americas" (?) But fun overall.' ,

      'Awsome game. Completed all levels without any hack jzt waited  for hope   ( the lives ) evrbdy shld try this. Sry i gonna uninstall this app only bcoz i finished all levels. Each time when u invite me to rate this app i was thinking that i shall rate this 5 if i win the 75th level. Now iam satisfied.... Great timepass.. Nice tactics, waiting 4 more awsome funny levels. If anybody has any diffrnt opinion cntact me on telegram @chichu  this is my user name. Thnx 4 thiz awsome gift babe.',
       'The game is really interesting and entertaining. The graphics are smooth and and the controls are manageable.   The thing I disliked through my game play is that you don\'t get any clues what you have to do and/or how to defeat the new "enemies". While you understand what exactly you have to do, you\'ve lost some lives. But that\'s not so important.  I will strongly recommend this game just because of its graphics, entertainment and due the fact, that this game is not pay-to-win game.',
       'I really liked this game. The levels are very challenging and this game is addictive and fun. The only issue is that there are only 5 short lives  that when our lives ran out, we have to wait 18-19 minutes long to have 5 lives again. Of course, there are many hard levels in the game that keeps us dying and think a way to pass the level. So if possible, please shorten the time, like 5-7 minutes only and let us really enjoy the game. It\'s more even challenging and thrilling if there are many lives. And this game will be really perfect for us. Thank you.',
       'Completed all but just couldn\'t get enough of it. Everyone should play Redball 4. It is D best android games I\'ve ever played. Those who complained about the Game play and control has an abnormal thumb. Easy, Fun & Challenging but nothing impossible to get through. I just hope they make new levels.',
       'I love this game üòçüòç it is my favourite but.... I don\'t like The lives system . I have to wait for it . I know that there is a pro version but.. can you please give us one or 2 extra lives when we complete a level? I think it\'s a great ideaüòãüòã btw i loved it üòçüòçüòç ill give it 5 stars thenüòäüòä',
       'Amazing game reminds me of the old school games . But the only problem is the lives you give us to play. They are so few and they take a lot of time to refill. PLEASE remove the life or ball things from this game it will be the best if you do that cause I was playing and level by level I was getting exited and I wanted to rate this game 5 stars but suddenly this GAME OVER thing comes and I had to give you this ratings.please let us play without stopping and waiting for the life to come.' ,

       'Used to be my favorite game.  The latest update completely changed the character of the game.  The ball is faster, bouncier, and everything is smaller, and it all adds to just randomness.  The AI got worse at the same time, so it\'s not really harder... just more random.  I now find that this game stresses me out instead of helping me relax, so I have to give it up.',

I wonder if there is even a end game or maybe the level keeps increasing aimlessly without any interesting change. Bored to max.',

      'I dig it overall. The controls to set the pieces take a bit of getting used to, but I understand why they did it this way. Your finger starts where it should, but moved slightly lower than the finishing point. This way your finger is out of the way and you can clearly see where your piece is going. Very fun game with lots of options.',

      'I do like this game. The support team is good and are helpful when they can be. But the silver and points awarded are much too low in my opinion, when in comparison to the costs of modules and supplies consumed during battles. Also the supply crates could stand to be better. The ships are pretty awesome and are very well rendered. Very good graphics. Everything runs smoothly with no lag or server issues.',
       'This is a great game!!.  Yes, computers have issues, yes its short then the PC version.  This is not a PC.  This is a great 5 minute break.  I play the PC game too.  Its flipping fantastic.  The programmers at WOW are brilliant  and they care about the product.  If you love histroy, Warships, strategic games pitting you against other human players.  GET THIS YOUR GAME.  There are other warship games.  None get it more right then WOW.',
       'The games mechanics and controls need an overhaul. The secondary weapons should be automated as fast firing ships operating in touch screen controls requires immense micro management. Second, the post battle screen graphs extremely limited battle details and the UI is equally as lacking in features and navigation. Finally, the battle time is far to short and the majority of battles are ended with ships still in action on both teams. Potential to be a 5 star rating when the mechanics become as user friendly as they they are on PC.',
       'Made you play the game for 30 minutes before you can enter a promo code. Can\'t enter any promo codes in game, you have to make an account for their stupid website. None of the promo codes actually work. Clearly a marketing scheme just to get a bunch of downloads so they can get more money from investors. I say boo.',
       'Great game absolutely the best that I have played on a mobile. However, sometimes when I go into battle it says I have no repairs or the other thing who\'s name I can\'t remember even though I have around 100 most of the time. Could you please look into this? It could be an interesting balancing mechanic if one ship is far and away better than all of the ones on the opposing team but for now it\'s just annoying. Thank you for making such a great game though and I will certainly keep being a highly active player.',
       'First,  the things I like: Game style and play. The fact that even if I move into 2g I do not lose connection.  The co-op mode.  Things I dislike : Training torpedoes(target lined area). The short battle time.  Some ships cam shoot through themselves.  Bombers on carriers that target you are invisible half the time.   Neutral things, that others complain about : Experience given  Various complaining type stuff that actually makes the game better.' ,

      'Horrendous abuse of in game ads like I\'ve never seen before in an app. At some points, you literally cannot proceed until you open the play store. The game races are short balancing acts wherein you simply try to keep your car on its wheels. Do not download, and do not let your kids start playing.',
       'Lost all in app purchases which amounts to stealing. Beware of doing in app purchases. Way to many ads. App also crashes a lot. Support said they would help then didn\'t respond after that. If my son was able to lose his progress and the money we sunk in the game because he was using multiple devices and didn\'t know what Cloud and Local meant which cause him to lose his progress then mabe this game shouldn\'t be labeled E for Everyone. Change the rating to Teen if they have to know what cloud means or risk losing there in app purchases.  Google change the rating on this game.',
       'Game is good graphics are also good but it tends to get crash several times when I played it. I have a moto g5 plus phone with 4gb ram and adreno 508 GPU and all the games played very smoothly in my phone even asphalt 8 also ,i don\'t think so it\'s my phone who is not handling the game so there should be some bugs in this game  please fix as soon as possible.',
       'The game is my little boys favourite but the recent batch of adverts in game (Yahoo specifically) don\'t close - meaning you have to force quit the game. Lazy programming and terrible QA process from the developers. Avoid.',
       'Whoever decided to put the HW Poppa wheelie in the game is an idiot. Loved this game until i came across that car. Im seconds away from fully upgrading and moving on but i couldnt let it go. That car is a load of frustration.',
       'Upgrading the vehicles makes little to no improvement to their performance, which makes the game too frustrating. For example you get stuck at exactly the same place without enough grip to go up a dumb hill no much how much you upgrade your car. There\'s no skill involved.  The game forces you to keep playing the same tracks until you get a better car.' ,

      'All you do is watch ads. Start the game, you get an ad. Play one round (rounds last about 30 seconds), watch an ad. Play two rounds, watch an ad. Want to double your earnings from last round? Watch an ad. Play a round. Game crashes. Open the game. Watch an ad. The game itself would be ok but the constant bombardment of ads is just too much. Literally half of the time spent in the game is just watching ads.',
       'Simple mechanics. A bit TOO simple. You can only equip each turret ONCE. So if you want to try different combinations, you\'re SEVERELY limited. The order in which you equip them matters very little since the rockets are random. There is very little player input. Equip. Press play. Sit back. Has potential but is just a simple time waster as is. DO NOT put any money into this. I don\'t even know how to make games but could probably do better than this within a few days of practice. Right now, it\'s just an ad machine. Ads.... Ads everywhere....',

      'I play a lot of different mahjong tile games in my phone and in my opinion this is one of the better ones. I like how you can close the ads. I like how clear the tiles are. I like your selection of art on the tiles. They are a bit different from other tile sets on other games. This makes the game a bit more difficult as your eye is not adjusted to the \'standard\' (for lack of a better word) monotonous art on generic tile sets. I keep downloading and trying other games by other makers, just to delete them and try another. This is one of the mahjong games that I keep in the rotation of other mahjong games, on my phone. I have yet to be bored with it. I think I will keep it for quite a while.',
       'Easy to play and speeds up your visual and touch senses.   HATE the adverts...drives me crazy when I need to reshuffle and have to wait 30 seconds to resume play or start again. Other than that I like it',
       'I want so badly to give 5 stars fully, but I\'m not too thrilled that paying the fee to remove the ads doesn\'t remove them fully. Other than that, I love it. The ads even after paying take up too much time though, which is a deterrent for wanting to play it more frequently.',
       'I think I really like this game. It helps me remember things. And yes I enjoy playing games that will help me remember things. Great work to you and your team on creating this game. And also I really like the music compare to the other games. Keep up the good work. Please pass this to the others.',
       'It would vastly improve game play if the ads didn\'t pop up when shuffling. By the time the timed ads finish you\'ve lost the game and have to start all over. Somewhat frustrating.',
       'Why do you ask what I think? If you  mean my opinion of this app, I don\'t \'think\' anything. There\'s is no tutorial and none of the buttons I poked did anything. Besides which I don\'t know the game anyway so the thing is not only   useless  but hopeless if it did come up with any response to any of the buttons' ,

      'Great game, fair balance of ads. Only thing it needs to mix all the songs thru all levels, as the single song while does hold up to repeat play, eventually gets repetitive. Also need better dictionary because I often play real words and it doesn\'t count them which stinks.',
       'I love it. There\'s only two problems. When you\'re on a streak and you accidentally hold a letter and don\'t make a word you lose your streak, even if you don\'t try to make a word. As well as that, the WORST part of the game is the notifications that constantly pop up even if you turn them off. Seriously might be the reason I uninstall the app.',
       'This game is sooo addicting, I can\'t stop playing it. There are several games that are very much like this one but I like this one the most because when it starts off with just 4 little squares it doesn\'t go on and on. The beginning is so boring when it\'s only 4 squares. This one starts out 4 squares but only goes about 8 levels then it gets harder right away. The others go on & on & on!! WORD CROSSY IS #1 !',
       'I enjoy this game as word games go,  particularly when you finally get to the more challenging levels.  However it is very frustrating that the same word may be accepted on one level but not on another.  So when you enter the word that was previously accepted you lose the accrued points build  up.  This is particularly an issue with plurals - it is so inconsistent in accepting such words. Plus how about only using real words?  Swop on level 275 is not a real word. I do like the daily challenge.',
       'Gameplay was nothing like demo video that convinced me to download it. Just another dull how many 3 letter words can you make from o, p and t game. No thanks.',
       'Paid to remove ads but after getting up over level 1000 the words became sooo inane and obscure as to be unrecognizable. Addictive but eventualy immposible unless you pay pay pay for hints. Level 1367 and I give up.' ,

       'Dragon city super game because we can easily hack the game no matter we ban Until they find',
       'Love this game so much. I can\'t put it down for to long. My son also loves it too. This would be alot better if i could do what i need to on my islands but cant. I have uninstalled and reinstalled 3-4 times and the dame thing happens like nothing loads',
       'This is a fun and enjoyable game..  honestly I am addicted to it and most of all the DRAGONS  are awesome.  My frustration  however  is that challenges are too short   which does not give us enough time to finish the tasks.   Also it takes too long to replenish gems, food and tokens  otherwise  this is a great game to play during your spare time.',
       'This is my favorite mobile game but I only rated it four stars for 1 reason. Training takes sooooo long. 48 hours for one move is outrageous as I think waiting 24 hours for a move is a bit crazy. I think there are ways for the system to improve. Like the ability to at least feed the training dragon, maybe even battle with the dragons while they train. Or at least shorten the waiting time. But so far, that is by far my biggest complaint.',
       'Ok game but the price to play is outrageous. The deveolpers are to greedy; price for coins and how far they go in the game is not reasonable. The events are structured to make you pay money throughout. When you think you are close the price will increase leaving you unsatisfied and dissapointed!!' ,

       'The ads are literally infuriating, if I let my phone lock it\'ll open with another freakin ad. Then when I\'m trying to play I\'ll accidentally click on an ad and it\'ll redirect me. I\'M JUST TRYING TO PRACTICE. This app used to be good but now it\'s riddled with ads like a virus. Do NOT get this app.',

       'Got annoyed by the notifications. Calm down, it\'s just a piano app. There are plenty of them, no way I\'m paying $20 to remove the ads.',

      'I Would Give It Five Stars...but...you should make it customizable for the colors you want to cycle through as you stack higher. THIS GAME IS NOT COLOR BLIND FRIENDLY. Great Idea Though, Nice Hand Eye Coordination Exercise. (I see Black and White, so a monochrome setting would be nice. Other people see colors differently as well) Needs A Color Cycle Customizer, or a set of different options for each type of Color Blind. Thanks in advance',
       'A Great Game For When You\'re Dumpin\'. I decided to install it because I ran out of YouTube videos while droppin\' a duce. I really enjoy and will be using it the next time I\'m in here as well. The ads are there, but they aren\'t too bad and there is an option to remove them for a small fee as well (which I plan to do.) My time in the bathroom has flew by because of the game and I\'m happy to say that. I don\'t like to stay too long. Great game!',
       'So,  basically it\'s a pretty fun app to play when you\'re bored. It\'s a great time killer, and is very challenging, but at the same time easy! It\'s a perfect app! I remember I downloaded this, and then I uninstalled it because I needed other apps on my phone. And now I installed it again, so then I have a fun game to play. I don\'t really have any games on my phone, so this is the perfect one. The inventors are genius! Five stars!!',
       'Good, with a major flaw I\'ve ran into an issue that occurs about 1 out of every 3 rounds, where I\'ll tap, and the game won\'t register the trap until well after the position I wanted. For a game based on timing and your ability to stack moving blocks, when you tap is important, and needs to be 100% reliable. I\'m on a Nexus 6P, very new phone with excellent hardware. I\'ve closed all background apps, to try and troubleshoot. It\'s an issue I\'d like to see fixed.',
       'Some faults Overall a simple yet addictive game. Too many ads. The game ends and instantly an ad appears and your still hitting the screen so you automatically click an ad. I\'m sure advertisers don\'t want to pay for a click that was purely a mistake. Also the leader board has people on 5000 points. I can\'t get past 78 after a lot of playing so I can\'t see 5000 points is scored without a hack.',
       'A good game, love this company This game is very good. I have only been playing it for about a week, but I truly enjoy it. I have one problem though, and I don\'t know if it is just my phone or what since it is new still. I cannot purchase any new block textures and I would really love to see the jelly or money textures. Other than that it is fine.' ,

       'Good time killer, only bad thing is I would have to constantly restart the level just to get the controls to work, it\'s like it would freeze up and the rooms where you have to shake your device a lot of the times the items wouldn\'t come out, but overall I enjoyed the 120 levels',

      'Between ads completely over running gameplay and the new requirement of having to earn stars to proceed, Rovio continues to run this once great game into the ground. **Update** game now freezes randomly requiring a force close. This is beyond ridiculous. I HATE what this franchise has become. Rovio should be ashamed.',
       'Too many ads way too often. I get a few sponsored ads help keep apps free or inexpensive but the frequency here makes the app annoyingly unuseable. Sponsors need to realise that the more we consumers are harassed with unwanted advertising, the LESS we will be interested in their product. I outright boycott or blacklist such companies and products.',
       'This game used to be awesome, sadly I have just removed it due to the star issue. I used to be able to play for fun, however, due to the its current standing, one MUST achieve three stars in each level in order to play other levels. Madness! Great job for taking the fun out of a game!',
       'I loved the mighty league ... until it forced an update that caused a glitch, and all of a sudden I was back in the Feather league --- and no matter what I did, I couldn\'t get out of it. I waited for update after update --- but to no avail. I was stuck. Not so fun anymore. I guess I\'ll uninstall and reinstall --- but even if it works, I\'ve lost over 13,000 points. #Fail',
       'Love this game but keeps freezing, a lot! It\'s more frustrating since the update where it costs 30 coins for the telescope but only get 5 minutes instead of 10 now and half the time my games frozen and the time runs out FIXXX',
       'Wth ! Game gets hanged, as soon as you use mighty scope in mighty league. Not one time, or occasionally. Everytime since last update. WHAT A MESS ! Above that it repeatedly cannot find internet connection, be it WiFi or DataPack.  GIVING 3STAR, for good old game. If no fix found, will keep downgrading.' ,

Good job square enix hope you guys do more a game like this on phone. Not all player hv time to play at home.',
       'waited a long time for this release and my 2 month old premium android device is not supported. Why can I play any other game in the app store except this one? Come on square, please make your resolution adaptable or whatever the issue is like you did with all your other games',
       'Genuinely a solid Final Fantasy Experience for mobile. Don\'t think this as a cheaped out on, cut down version of FFXV on the console! The Voice Acting and story remain perfectly recreated and the combat is genuinely (for me anyway) way more fun than in the console version itself. Love everything about this game, well done to Square Enix and the FF team!',
       'I\'m late to the world of Final Fantasy, I\'ve always know about it but I am not a fan of turn based action. Then Finial Fantasy XV comes out for XBOX ONE X and I still ignore it. I noticed that it came out for mobile and as I just purchased a Razer Phone I decided to give it a try and I loved it. Then I just finished watching Kingsglave on Netflix and I\'m hooked. So because of a Android game I have now watched a movie and pre ordered the Windows edition to through my top spec gaming rig at it in all its glory. Love it.',
       'Oh WOW Square Enix you have nailed this. It is so easy to play, so fun and the gameplay is just perfect for mobile. Those who are complaining just need faster phones. 10 minutes into this game and all I can say is this is amazing!! It is definately a much better launch than ff15 on ps4. 10/10!  PS. Game is now stuck on loading screen when I try to load game. Needs to be fixed!',
       'Love what you have done with this game, the gameplay is incredible and it feels just like the ps4 version. After waiting so long for this to come out, it is better than I could have imagined. The the only thing that i would change would be to add the option to chose to use a joy stick. I don\'t mind using touch for everything else, but would love to at least have the option to use a joy stick for moving around. Other than that though, very impressed with the game.' ,

      'I never had to pay a single cent for this game, and it\'s working out perfectly fine for me. Sure, you can pay for more coins and items to level up quicker - but you can enjoy the game without paying anything. I get raided too but on a fairly acceptable basis. I love this game. Only thing is, I don\'t like my non-responsive faction members and I\'m worried once I leave my faction I couldn\'t join another one. Ah well. That being said, 5 stars for the game.',
       'This game is a treasure! It has kept me entertained for about 1 year and a half so far! I love the story parts and maps and I want to congratulate the developers! Good job, Nice graphics, Great game. Although, I lost my save file because this game doesn\'t make any easy whatsoever to load save files. Please fix that! Thanks!',
       'No one from the support team will respond. My game was unistalled and reinstall and I lost 2 years worth of data. Can\'t remember sync it and I know scopely can do it for me. I\'ve provided everything they need and still nothing via email or in-game support. Will change my rating if this is sorted',
       'I can\'t get passed the opening narration page. Therefore, I can\'t even play! The "skip" button doesn\'t work! The "next" button doesn\'t work either! I\'d have given 0 stars if possible. I won\'t change my review until after the issue is solved. I\'m using the most recent update for Android and Google play.',
       'I love the game it\'s really epic. But one thing that pisses me off is during the tournament for survival after completing a level with 3 stars there is this part where u have to claim tokens ND after claiming the game crashes  ND starts again. So could u please fix that would mean a lot.. otherwise I got no other problems',
       'This game is my absolute favorite on my android im a huge TWD fan so this is a Great game offering the zombie rpg style awesomness! They keep updating the game and the new update is amazing with recent faction boss battle assaults, a gear shop, friendly faction battles! I suggest this game highly if you enjoy turn based, zombie smashing fun!' ,

      'this game is so simple but yet so challenging. some levels seem impossible but the great thing is you can still advance as long as you have enough points. very well done. hats off to the designer. the physics are coded perfect as well for gravity friction inertia and sometimes extra bounce..  love it. can only handle it in bursts of play because it works your brain so intensely. havent used the hints either though. if you dont keep coming back to play this then you probably arent a very interesting person and spend too much time diddling your privates',
       'A good sign of high intelligence would be to not pay for this.   On a tablet with a pen,  this probably works a little better but on a phone with 1 minute ads,   it\'s really frustrating.   Basically,  you find a solution and have to repeat it 30 times until the dull and unrealistic physics of this program finally accept it.',
       'I introduced this game to my 8 year old and my husband. We are all hooked! I am fascinated by the concept and simple yet brilliant design. The forced 30 second ads that another reviewer mentioned are only if you want a hint. The between-round ads are short and intermittent.',
       'Calling this a physics game is a joke. Sure, it has a physics engine that handles things like acceleration, "mass" and magnetism... But it\'s really just a very limited drawing game. Want to draw a ramp because it would lead to the most elegant solution? Sorry, can\'t... Because your "pencil" is too thick and the ball just hits the base of the ramp and bounces off. Know a simple solution? Well, have fun drawing it fifteen times while you get the exact dimensions needed in a very inexact system. I really think there are far better games to practice problem solving that don\'t get in your way as much as this one.',
       'The ads suck horribly if you don\'t buy it! But it is worth the dollar. Drawing with your finger is not very precise, but more about timing and placement.  So be prepared to reset, and try again numerous times, especially if you are going for a 3 star complete.  Great game!',
       'LOVE this game!! Literally, I don\'t think I can explain it. Just play it, and see for yourself :D    If you like figuring stuff & puzzles out, this is totally for you! And also, it\'s just so satisfying to watch. I personally play lots of the puzzles over & over again, just to see the graphics, how all the objects fly and move üòú' ,

       'So first of all way too many ads... When you click race you get Frozen and then sent to home screen and you lose your fuel... When you\'re "waiting on players" and they don\'t show up you lose fuel.. out of 10 attempts to start a race I play one',
       'I reinstalled the game because the game has no sound what so ever, and now it has put me down to level 3 and I lost all my progression. Hours just down the drain. And to top it off, there still is no sound.',
       'Amazing concept, I just hate when I just spent 20 gas tanks on 1 race and either it moves me to another lobby where I have to spend another 20 gas tanks and it might happen again, or I am in a race and the server crashes and I lose 20 gas tanks. Other than that, this is a very fun game. The gas tanks regenerate to full in a quick amount of time. And there are many chances to earn a lot of stuff, Wish I got it sooner.',

      'I love Beat the Boss 4! But there are some things that I would like to be fixed. For example, when naming your custom boss, the name duplicates. The way to fix it is by putting spaces after it. Another example is that the boss customization screen sometimes switches back to boss selection screen and can\'t go back after being there for long periods of time. I would love to give this game 5 stars if these issues were fixed.',
       'Game is now unplayable due to ads and KIIP rewards popups. The ads bring up my status bar so I can\'t X out of the ad, and the app hangs when trying to load the KIIP program. I have no interest in trying to play something that shovels ads in your face more often than you can actually play.',
       'I loved it. I understand the ads are so that you can continue your work. However, there is a few probelms. First of all, when you click on the judgey/uneven eyes, they change to even eyes. Second of all, when you click on a custom character, the game doubles the name, and following along with that, sometimes it undoes it. I understand if it takes a long time, but i\'m asking you, if you can, to please fix these when you can. Sorry for bothering you.      Doge is waiting',
       'Too many ads. It\'s annoying especially when you are connected to the internet. The King Boss is not working and is always saying "Something went wrong, please try again later" and crashes the whole gane. On the other hand it\'s a super addictive and fun game to play.',
       'This game needs a lot of work done. So many glitches its really weird and hard to explain the glitches that happen. One of them was the screen uncalibrated itself an it was moved to the upper left side , an the right side was just black . idek if that makes sense but it shouldn\'t happen.',
       'The game is amazing, but it is pathetic at the fact that there are ads popping up every 2 minutes and there\'s no way to remove them... I would be happy to pay to remove the ads, I won\'t be playing this game until this is fixed. I remember playing this game years ago, I understand you guys may be making more money from displaying ads than people paying to remove them.' ,

      'You see I\'m not the only person  who wouldn\'t recommend this game. Adds constantly and how could you play they game when it\'s so tricky to drive. I thought it was my bad driving but it seems I\'m not the only one who disliked this game.so  please make some improvements. I could drag you through all the bad things but I won\'t make you suffer. So I will give it sadly a üëé.',
       'The game is ok at least when I get a chance to play it -there are way too many ads every time i click on a level to play an ad shows up even sometimes during when i play an ad shows up. I strongly recommend that you do not install this app',
       'Th is game sucks! It\'s a total waste of time and it is so boring. This is the worst game everüò°üò§ Also there are so many stupid ads! The taxi is so slow and when other cars get in front of you it\'s even slower. I would not recommend this game to anyone!',
       'First if all... Its down right BORING! Also there is adds after every single level! Sometimes the adds are weird and innaproprete! I do NOT reccomend this game, download at your own risküòï',
       'I liked the game and all but there were way to many ads. Every level there was a thirty second video playing and some of them were extremely inappropriate. I got a bit impatient waiting for all the ads to end but I liked the game set-up. I think that was a neat idea. I just think it would be better without all the interruptions',
       'I think it should be a bit more realistic and by that I mean more people on the streets; if you crash into someone, that person would come out of their car angry and cars get damaged when you crash into them. Maybe, to add a bit more reality to the game, you could add the money that they pay you to the levels. Apart from that it is an excellent game. However, some people, when they get in a taxi, chat away to the taxi driver.' ,

      'Hi developer,    I love the update so much and I\'m excited for the vault and the balancing beam! So please in the next update can u add it please! And also I have request.    My request is can u change the nail salon to lock and unlock the spa please and I want the uneven bars and vault can u add it on the training center.    Sorry for people to requesting to lock the nail salon especially that who love the nail salon.    Thank you developer that\'s all its OK to me if didn\'t add my request but its really OK to me if u add it.',
       'This is an awesome game! I love dressing up the character and doing her hair! My favorite part is when you create the routine on ghr bars or floor! The only problem is that you have to pay with real money for some items such as dance moves or clothing. I don\'t think that makes the game s enjoyable. Overall it is really fun and a great game! Pros: Super fun for any age and not inappropriate! Cons: Sooooo addictive!!! (Not lyeing!)üòÅüòÜ‚ò∫üòÄüòÉüòÑ',
       'This game is a fun game even better now with the uneven bars as well as the floor. One thing that I kinda need to tell you is that it is February and the Christmas app picture is still there , please get it back to normal pls pls please and also can you make all of the places unlocked because I don\'t have the money to spend on getting  all the places and clothes and all that stuff.  Pls reply to me.  When is the vault and beam coming I hope it is here soon as I love gymnastics.  And that\'s all of the updates that I wanted to say , but should you get the game?  Yes it is a good fun sporty game to play and if you like salon games play this it is a good salon game.Each round I am sure that all skills on this game are üíØ percent real skills that real gymnasts do.  Get the game I am sure you will like it but the ads but don\'t stop that from getting at you , you still can play the game.  That\'s it bye',
       'I Love the game, but there are some things i would love fixed. First maybe unlock all the places like the salon. That or let us earn the places, not uave to buy them. Also it would be great if you could upload the beam and vault. They always say coming soon. This would become the only game i played if these were done. Thabk you.',
       'I really want the vault and the balance beam because they are super cool I love all the dance moves u can have and I have a request can u add long hair and shoes and ponytails and dresses u don\'t have to add all of those but if u do that would super exciting! Can u add houses too so u can hang your photos and read the magazine with your pic on it! Like I said u don\'t have to add all of these but it would be a great pleasure if u do!',
       'Great graffics and cute outfits and styles for cloths and make-up BUT the ads are so long.  There like 30 secs long and its the same dive ad over and over again with a few other ads, the ads pop up right as yourvun the middle of a competition.  And if u want a certain pose you it will have a ad icon next to it and IRS so annoying. Please fix these crazy amounts if ads and timing for them.' ,
    recentChanges: 
      '> Merry Christmas, you awesome gymnasts!',
       '> You asked, we listened! We‚Äôve added new ways to win - now you can show off your impeccable moves on the uneven bars.',

    description: 'This is by far the most flexible word search app on the market. Multiple configuration options create a game that exactly corresponds to your device and your expertise.Play with an English word list or choose one of 23 other languages.Designed for fun games from the smallest mobile phones up to the largest tablets.Bored of seeing the same words appear repeatedly? Frustrated at looking for bizarre words that are not even English? Struggled with grids that are inappropriate for your device or difficult to read? Word Search Ultimate solves all these problems. You can configure:1) Grid size    Specify exactly how many columns and rows to use (from 3 to 20). Even non square grids (e.g. 12x15) are possible.2) Screen layout    Choose how much screen space for the grid and how much for the word list, using our unique movable split bar.3) Difficulty of the game    Specify approximate proportion of words that are written diagonally, backwards or vertically (e.g. allow no diagonal or backwards words, ideal for introducing children to Word Search).4) Difficulty of the words    Specify the size of the dictionary to generate a game, from the 500 most common words (good for kids and language students), up to 80,000 words.5) Maximum # of words    Choose the maximum number of words to find in one game, from 1 to 150. This will provide enough words to fill a 20x20 grid.6) Minimum & Maximum word length    This helps avoid searching for many small words (a common problem in word apps). Also useful for specifying really difficult games (e.g. set both minimum and maximum word length to three).7) Highlighting    Mark the already found words, or keep the grid unmarked and easy to read.8) Word list layout    The word list can be arranged in columns for easy reading, or close to each other to minimize screen space.9) Language    Choose the language of the word list, from a large range of downloadable dictionaries.  24 languages are currently available (see below).10) Orientation    Can be played in portrait or landscape mode. Just rotate your device and the display adjusts automatically.11) Word categories    Choose the words to find from a range of categories; e.g. animals, food etc.This app gives you the ultimate power to play the game just the way you want.Each game is assigned a difficulty level from 0 (easy) to 9 (very hard). The difficulty level is determined by the settings. Each difficulty level maintains the high scores (measured by fastest time to complete the game). The game displays the best 20 scores for each difficulty level.Compare your high scores with others around the world by using Google Play\'s "Game Services".Other features unique to this app:1) Two methods of selecting words: (i) the classic swipe (ii) by touching the first and last letter of the word from the grid.2) Game aid if you are having difficulty. You can choose to reveal a word that you cannot find.3) View the definition of the word from an online source (e.g. Wiktionary), optimized for viewing on a small screen.4) When you play with a word list in a foreign language, the word definition will (where possible) be in your own language. This is great for language learning!Additional Features planned for a future version of this app:1) Blind mode.  The word list is hidden. Instead you must find the words within the grid. Useful in combination with word categories.2) Play against others.3) Give us feedback on other features you would like to see.Dictionaries available are English, Spanish, Portuguese, Russian, Arabic, French, German, Italian, Indonesian, Bulgarian, Croatian, Czech, Danish, Greek, Hungarian, Polish, Romanian, Serbian(Latin), Serbian(Cyrillic), Slovak, Slovene, Swedish, Turkish, Ukrainian and more coming later',

I like that can change the min length of a word. And you can choose the difficulty. And the max word length brilliant the only thing I would say. Is can you put more choices of colours for background colours. And list colours. Also button colours',

      'It\'s a great game in terms of versatility (as versatile a single game can be) and you can almost always play as there is a table for any amount in the start-up kitty. Like most Android poker games it gives you the option for daily free chips so you can play daily should you wish. Where it falls short is table talk and conversations are extremely limited. I mostly play in bed, at night, until sleepy so table talk isn\'t really for me most of the time but if you are wanting a social chit-chat game this isn\'t it.',
       'Look at your ledger board.. Typically the 1st names are Fake profiles, so you can\'t advance without buying chips to beat unreasonable winnings.. They all have similar stats.. no best winning hand.. no pic.. some have same name or real similar..It\'s obvious they are fake and Zynga has confirmed this, yet hasn\'t removed them.. They continue to allow it every week..',
       'Good game, but it has a major bug that a lot of people face daily, most of my poker buddies get the same issue. Joining a table will leave us on the loading screen and it gets stuck there. Back button does nothing, and you have to force exit the game. Sit and go tournaments do work every time, which is odd. I\'ve invested over 50 euros in this game, but with a game breaking bug like this, I\'m considering uninstalling it.',
       'I have to bring you down to 4 Stars bcos I think you manipulate my play. Imagine within 1 day I lost 400 million chips. Every hand I lost weirdly. Examples, I had a pair of Aces but lost to 2 pairs, I had a straight but lost to flush, I had flush but lost to house and the list goes on. Don\'t tell me that was coincidences or no luck and not my day. Then your announcements kept popping out telling me it is time to purchase chips and continue to play like a real HiRoller. This is really sickening to realise that I had been taken for a ride. Sorry I won\'t buy chips after this scam. When Iost the balance 47 millions chips I will say "Hasta La Vista" to you!',
       'What the hell zynga? I won around 20m, went back to lobby and suprise. 7m dissapeared in the dust. How can you take so much from a win? This game is so unfair and I\'m sure it\'s rigged. In real life you\'ll never see dozens of flushes and straights and a few 4 of a kinds in a day. Every day. And bots, hackers or whatever they are make it impossible to get to top xx in leagues so there\'s no way to advance unless you have a lot of chips and win a lot. I recommend you to not purchase anything because this game is broken.',
       'I think there\'s something wrong with this game, because since last night, it\'s so hard to join a room. Now, I can\'t join any room. I have no problem in entering the lobby, but I can\'t join any room because it\'s always loading. And fyi, there\'s no problem with my connection.' ,

      'Downloaded this through another app (free golden eagles) where if you downloaded and played this game, and got castle to level 10 would be rewarded. Sent off request to support a number of times with proof and no reply, and after a week still no reward.   So if you are downloading this to get reward from another app don\'t bother as you won\'t get it',
       'Pure pay tto win. You will either pay or quit out of frustration. Build times are hilarious. Seriously, our Earth\'s sun will die before you max out your hero\'s knowledge or most any other knowledge.  The Stronghold is worthless and a huge waste of resources. It\'s more of a trophy.  Sure you can join a clan, get some bonuses and buy some shields with points, but you will be destroyed by the winners. Me, I had a gift card and blew on this game, now I just start fights and make people quit.',
       'The game itself is great. Zero complaints there. But the fact that it I am unable to ever log in is infuriating. I\'ve literally been zeroed out because the app won\'t let me log in... multiple times. It\'s absolutely ridiculous. Needs to be fixed.',
       'you guys give an update for us to move kingdoms. but it make so expensive that\'s it\'s unaffordable. like really 2 dakars  on a 12.99 pack. So you expect us to spend over 100 dollars just to move a kingdom. I don\'t know if your team there at plarium realizes that there is not 1 ps4 game that costs this much. seriously don\'t release an update that\'s not affordable don\'t make any sense.',
       'Great time killer, I love the interaction and concept of the game. It can get a bit laggy at times and at it\'s worst, it will crash on you. The wait times are unbearable though. No ads at all since the first time I played too!',
       'Having trouble still with scrolling through the Kingdom map. Also got a issue with someone \'s shield not coming down when he attacked me. People cannot attack while there shield is up, or do they attack that fast they put a shield up after the attack. less than 1 minute .Anyway the game is very slow and glitchy, was better when first installed it. I cannot do battles like this the game sometimes crashes or I have connection problems.' ,

      'One of the best Sonic games with some cool new features added. It\'s even better then ever with the glitches fixed. (Thanks Sega/Whitehead!) It\'s very playable with a phone touchscreen, and plays like the original.  Could use the custom touchscreen control options that Sonic 1 & 2 had, but the controls work just as good as those regardless. Kinda wish it had Knuckles unlockable though. Still, great remake, time trial mode is great, and offers plenty of unlockables. It\'s especially worth buying "no ads" for offline play.',
       'Hey this game is good but what\'s up with the ring statics and the walk and tap down? Some times in a act I walk into a couple rings, only to hear this crazy static. And the spining. When I spin(walk and then tap down) I don\'t hear a thing. Normally doing that you should hear this sound like in other sonic games. Can you fix both of these glitches? Thanks so much.',
       'THANK YOU :) but the audio quality is bad. Keeps cracking. This wasn\'t a problem when this game was on the app store before :( and it kinda sucks that I can\'t play offline. I wouldn\'t mind paying if it means I can',
       'Well see its good game buuut there are waayy too many ads like heck if I pause it it will show an add and I don\'t see way you have to stay connected to the internet at all times',
       'Who is the clown behind this release of Sonic CD? No, really. Why would Sega allow a game as crucial to its history and as important to fans as Sonic CD to have such a mediocre release like this? The sound is broken, the adds aren\'t completely removed when you buy the game, and there are some glitches. Christian Whitehead sis an amazing job recreating this game in HD so that you can go and simply ruin his passionate, amazing work? This is disrespectful with everyone, including him. I\'m sure he gets pissed with this kind of thing. F*** you, Sega.',
       'PLEASE FIX THIS BUG!!!  Whenever I open the app, it goes to a black screen for 2 seconds, then force closes itself. Please fix this! I\'ve been hoping SEGA classic games would add this game to the app store for sooooo long!' ,

My shooting power is lvl 22, and my shooting speed is lvl 21, and I have no other tanks unlocked even though I\'m far above level requirements. Please fix this',
       'This used to be one of my favorite games out there. But lately I can\'t hardly play past about 20 seconds without it shutting down. No sense in trying to get a high score. Game will just close. I\'m far enough I could play until I wanted to be done, but the game will crash on me long before that. Until that\'s fixed I\'m pretty much done with this app.',
       'Very addictive. I\'ve encountered a few bugs with the latest updates. Mine doesn\'t crash but there\'s a cutoff at 2.15 Bil. That is messed up! I\'ve played all this time just to get stopped because the code doesn\'t allow you to go past 2.5 billion points or past 2.5 billion for high score. Yet there\'s a triple shooter still available to get to take me where?? I\'ve maxed out the game. Plz update the code to let the scores go higher!!',
       'Crash after crash after crash after crash, I like the game, And the idea of the game is simple and pretty fun and good for wasting time. But keeping in mind it takes a maximum of 2 days to create the game from scratch, because there isn\'t much to this game. Surely there would be an update and hopefully it will stop crashing soon. Because it keeps crashing. And the controls are weird. I hold my thumb on the little tank, I move my thumb a little bit to the right and the tank immediately goes straight to the far edge on the right and the tank isn\'t underneath my thumb anymore. The tank should always be where your thumb is.',
       'So many crashes!! Why?!?! I thought I would love this game (which I do very addictive until crashes invaded earth) but it just gives me like 20 seconds and then it decides to give up on me and crash.. YAY. :/ This thing needs to stop, like right now. But you guys are lucky that I\'m a nice person because I still like it. But until you fix your problem, I\'m uninstalling it. Sorry',
       'Well for starters it crashes too much. Second you cant even make it past the 5th row. Third too many ads. 4 never playing this again literally wish i didn\'t waste 2 minutes on this and 5 2 star games more like no star games' ,

      'The game is awesome. It is funny, has some challenges, it\'s community is friendly and you can collect familiars. Also you can use your equipment as costumes if you like a specific item\'s look. =D And I didn\'t even talk about the way the game looks like... It\'s the best pixel art I have seen in a while. =) So stop reading and start playing, have fun and thanks for making this game Developers! =D ( The only thing I miss is more coop gameplay =\'D )',
       'Cute, adorable and haven\'t seen any hungry money grabbing offers. Game is relaxing and you can even 5x the speed during battle. Other games would want to bite your wallet for that special feature. Get to recruit familiars from battle and it has an auto feature just in case you get lost. The items change how your characters look and you can pretty much be whatever you like. Good overall game, will be playing for a while üòÄ',
       'Great game and a lot of fun but... waiting for energy REALLY kills this game for me. I really don\'t feel energy limitations should be part of of a dungeon crawler where the object of the game is to run random dungeons for the chance of better loot.  I for one will never spend money on refreshing my energy in a game like this and the energy refresh costs are pretty high.   I feel like it be playing this game none stop if it weren\'t for the energy restrictions.   Otherwise good game and very enjoyable - when I can play.',
       'The perfect MMO RPG for your phone in my personal opinion. If you\'re a fan of dungeon games then this is the game for you. With its cute design, simple combat systems, dungeon patterns and loot systems, you\'ll find yourself easily sucked into the MMORPG world of Bit Heroes. Fight your way through the dungeons and gear up to strike fear imto the creatures who dwell within as well as the other players in challenging PvP matches.',
       'Spent over ¬£200 in game and no legendary pet or accessory. This game uses RNG and it\'s extremely low you can\'t advance past a certain level unless you spend lots of money and even then you have to be extremely lucky to get legendary pet or accessory. Guilds won\'t take you without legendary pet or accessory. Don\'t waste your time on this PAY 2 PLAY game',
       'Perfect, very close to the perfect ultimate bit adventure rpg! I look forward to expanded versions. For this one the only issue i have is when i accept or decline a friend request, and i think duels, the request text lingers above for white someone even tho i already accepted/declined. Great work tho! I love this game!' ,

      'Very good game, very addictive, but unfortunately the birds theme and the circus theme are not very good. They are not so sensitive to touch and jump late. My favourite is the farm one. Love the little cow :) Later update: I love the new updates what let me combine any characters with any theme, and the fever mode is cute ;)',
       'There are wayyyy too many ads seriously. You don\'t need that many ads for your game you have enough money you have a bursting game brand . Most of your games don\'t even have as many ads. Every failed turn "here\'s an ad buy my game!!!!" No!!!',
       'WAYYYYY too many adds. There is an add after EVERY round. That\'s annoying. The game is great, but that\'s NOT how to get people to purchase it. Please consider lessening the adds to maybe once every 5 minutes, and not every 5 seconds!!',
       'My one complaint is the fact when i upgraded my phone and redownloaded this game i lost all my progress from the last phone from this game. Super bummed because I almost had all my characters.',
       'It is a way for marketing. You will get adds after every 30 sec and ad is non skippable. Means its just a way to kill ur precious time and way to frustrate urself. So i would susggest dont install if u want to save ur time.',
       'The line\'s that show up for average and daily best and every 100 are an unnecessary distraction. Give me the option remove and I would say this is a 4 star.' ,

      'Its a fun game, really, however in my opinion its too easy. I got 150 First try and 346  my second. and maybe consider adding things to unlock like different balls or hoops. other than that its a fun game to kill time',
       'I like the game and the idea of it, but the only problem I have with it, its the ads. Dear God there is a lot of ads, even when I\'m in the middle of a game, an ad pops up from the bottom. Just try to lower the amount of ads especially on the challenges, I hate to be asked and forced to watch an ad everytime I fail a challenge or complete it',
       'I absolutely love the game the only.problem I\'m having is when I\'m playing I keep knocking the ad advert at the bottom where your thumb goes to move the net and keeps ending game and making me.lose cause of that will change rating if gets sorted',
       'This is an awesome game! I love it but maybe it could have a few more fetures like it could have a two person mode, it could have two hoops to make it harder. Or maybe it can have like a differnt backround. Over all the game is pretty great.',
       'The first time I played I easily got over 800, now I swear the game upped it\'s difficulty like crazy, I can\'t get past the 200s. Not sure if it\'s a bug, an Easter egg feature or what, or if it\'s because I completed challenges but I don\'t appreciate the inconsistency especially when playing against friends and I don\'t feel evenly matched :(',

Turn of data and wifi everytime id open this app. Before the update, the game would continue in the background but not any more, thanks to the crazy grinding element and ads, not worth a single byte of space imo.',

       'The game was a decent waste of time.  My biggest complaint is the insane amount of ads.  You get an adult every level up, every time you open up the buy car selection, everytime you bring a car back in off the track.  It\'s literally crazy.  Sure you can make an in ap purchase to get rid of the ads.  They put in so many ads they make you want to buy the option to get rid of them.  I\'m deleting this game.',
       'This game has a lot of potential but is under par. It has so many ads that to play the game I literally turned off my wifi. There\'s also a bug that is very annoying. Whenever you pull a car off a track you can\'t put it back on immediately, and it\'s stuck where you called it back. The game also lacks a feeling of progression. Whenever I upgrade to the next car I feel like I\'m taking a step back. Also the economy is all out of whack with cars going into the thousand thousands. I disliked the experience and would not recommend the game to anyone.' ,

      'Really fun game. My 2 year old adores Hank. The only thing that I feel is missing is a way to save your progress to the cloud. My phone needed to be reset a couple times and we had to start over. Didn\'t mind so much because hank as a puppy is much cuter.',
       'I like this new update. Hanks now have His own happy meter like Tom and Angela. Nice. Also this is just my suggestion. Can you guys also make My Talking Ben and My Talking Ginger. Those two deserved their own My Talking games. Also can you guys add more money to Tom cause He always have just one big gold coin and that\'s it. You know Angela have plenty of gold coin even Hanks have three. It\'s not fair. Lastly good job guys.',
       'Great game, probably best talking animal game out for adults n kids... but sometimes u watch a video so u can spin the wheel n win gems or coins but the wheel not always comes up... ive had approx. 20x it has not happened in last 4 hrs... would like it redeemed n fixed plz...',
       'I like my talking tom and I download this one thinking that it will have some fun stuff like play mini games I know this one have a picture feature but man only eat, pet, sleep , and pics? Sorry I am re-downloading my talking Tom and start from scratch that only take pics feed and sleep on this game',
       'My three year old grand daughter got around my password and charged $40 of in app purchases and did a monthly subscription, too. I have gone through everything to try to remedy this, with no help from the customer service from the this apps developer.',
       'I\'m only on level 1 wrong so correct me if im wrong but I thought the game was a bit boring at first and the game doesn\'t seem to give you much choice andyou have to folow what it says but if you enjoy the game thats great! I also did like that u got stickers for taking pics. I did end up having to uninstall the game as it took up to much storage space D: Overall I did really enjoy the game yay =D' ,

      'Classic tetris with modern graphics, you can use one touch controls or classic directional pad if you wish, both have their own advantage. I am afraid I can\'t find Bradinsky song. It\'s okay for me with advisement because EA need something to eat right? Lol',
       'Enjoyed it at first, and short adverts were expected, but recently adverts have become longer, and now last longer than the game. The latest video advert lasted inbetween games lasted 8 mins....ridiculous!!!. I understand the need for adverts, but if you can\'t play the game, the adverts are pointless, espeacially if it makes players quit.',
       'I just wanted to play Tetris. Happy to pay for it, was hoping I could pay a $5-10 purchase price and then have the game and play it to my liking. No, need to join the T Club (who comes up with this) and pay an ongoing fee. It\'s TETRIS from the 80s, EA must you milk everything. Nothing is sacred',
       'When I saw that EA took on the game I immediately purchased it thinking it was any good. The graphics are good, but the controls are nerve-wrecking and the game makes decisions for you. It responds slowly and the block hold works by itself. These little things make you lose and make the game unplayable. Don\'t download it - free or not, look for another Tetris because this does no justice to the original',
       'Great game, but there\'s an annoying window that pops up everytime I try and start a new marathon. The window is pretty much useless and wastes my time. Would give this 5 stars if it gets patched',
       'Since you really really want a review, when I adjust music and SFX to minimum, I expect no sound at all. Please allow for sound to be muted. Very annoying to have button that serve no purpose. Sure you need ads to survive EA big company like you, go ahead but you want to play the ad with sound over what I have playing that\'s annoying enough, at least optimise the sound so that it doesn\'t play at max volume.' ,

      'I was really enjoying the game, it\'s fun. Don\'t get me wrong. But I\'ve signed in every day, every single day and I make sure I do, and sometimes I do it from my iPad and sometimes I do it from my phone. And sometimes it lags and says I missed a day before it fixes. But today I signed in and it told me I missed a day. So I tried it on my phone and it still said I missed a day so I had to restart from the first day in the current collection item. I\'m very frustrated and upset by this. So this whole \'signing on from a different device\' thing is glitchy af and my game got messed up because of it. Very upsetting. Otherwise it would be a 5star.',
       'This game is amazing! Most games of this style sacrifice story for the sake of puzzles, or vice versa, but this is a perfect balance and blend of both. I was hooked from the first moment, and the briliant and individual characters and challenging - but not impossible - puzzles have kept me eagerly impatient to play more. (My only complaint is that the energy refill feels SO SLOW when all I want to do is play more!)',
       'I\'d give 5 stars for everything if the new update would work. It continues to crash. I love this game and wish I could play. I\'m also loosing 2 days of a boost item b/c I can\'t play ANY level.',
       'Love the game but miss not been able to get coins or energy with the new upgrade (like you could with the snowmen). Also when the games get tougher, a little extra time added when you add more things to find would be nice too.',
       'Thoroughly annoyed now. Another update, another problem. If this could be sorted then it would be worth recommending but once again it\'s glitching so I can\'t play it. Says it\'s awaiting downloads but won\'t do it.',
       'I usually love this game but it\'s having issues the lastt day and a half that keep me from playing. I\'m losing quest time and my daily bonus because of it. No other apps are giving me trouble but this one. Ugh!' ,

      'I like it a lot but I hate how the drawings are so linked with pokemon go. I hate pokemon go!!!!! The graphics are okay but I wish they were a bit better quality. It is confusing if you pick paint or something it just goes back to the original colour. I didn\'t like how easy the drawings were and I don\'t think the glow art works. It just comes out as crayon. I wouldn\'t recommend this game if you don\'t like colouring. It\'s ok!!!!',
       'I love this app! It\'s sooo good. And its brilliant for when your bored. But its a little hard sometimes to go over the lines with our fingers as the lines are so thin. But overall I think it\'s a fantastic app!',
       'I think there should be more cartoons to draw and color. And it should not always be right colors to trace it in. Also i think that one small part of the picture shouldn\'t color the whole background, because what if you didn\'t want them bother the same exact color, because no affence, but it looks weird and ugly sometimes. Sorry for no compliments.                    LOVE, YOUR DEAR FRIEND!!!',
       'It\'s a great app however it keeps crashing and I have to start the drawing all over again. The whole app stops and my drawing starts over and it\'s really annoying. If this gets fixed I will definitely rate 5 stars',
       'It keeps crashing it doesn\'t help at all there are like 10 characters I\'m a girl so I don\'t like pokemon I\'m an 8 year old so I\'d rather have older  girl characters and you can\'t choose the colors to draw with.There is nothing good about this don\'t download this if you are  older than 5 years and your a girl and your not babyish',
       'I like it because it teaches young artists how to draw animated characters such as Pok√©mon Avengers Princess and loads more characters from movies like Snow white and the seven dwarfs and Toy story 2! Overall it is a brilliant app for boys and girls of all ages!' ,

      'Whenever I try to open the app the screen starts flashing black and it\'ll stay like that or keeping turning back to the screen I was on and off, which ends up somewhat strobe-like. The actual game itself is amazing despite having a hard time trying to beat the bacteria level but, what\'s the point of a good game concept, if the game won\'t work properly',
       'I thought the new scenario was a free-trial only like the simian flu. (At least you can unlock it after being a brutal pro at the game) I\'m gonna enjoy playing this a good few times and unlock even MORE scenarios. Keep up the good work! I wanted to make a suggestion, but I just can\'t remember now. Oh well...',
       'Fun game. I wish the rate of death was more consistent. 37,000,000 a day at one point, but waiting 6 months for 100,000 to die towards the end. The disease didn\'t change, the rate of death shouldn\'t decrease just because there are fewer people. Good game otherwise',
       'I didn\'t buy the new plague, i might need to. The first 2 difficulty settings are easy, the 3rd not so much. Good game to me! Just have to read what it is that you spend your DNA points on and you should do just fine',
       'Really annoying ads keep repeating and covering controls.  So annoying. Pity as game is unplayable like this. It never used to happen before. Why can\'t developer just charge for extra content rather than make game unplayable. Will have to remove.',
       'Awesome game! Very addicting! You can replay over and over and it doesn\'t get boring! Just keeps getting better!  There is no need to buy if you don\'t want to.... Just because you suck doesn\'t mean it isn\'t beatable... You shouldn\'t give low stars because it\'s a difficult game! It\'s very beatable without purchase!!!  5 stars!!!!  Just keep trying!  Evolve!' ,

      'I love the game. the game play itself is very self explanatory, quick and very good fps however, they have scammed me. I spent 12.99 on gbucks, the purchase was confirmed, and right after they asked me if i had liked to submit another card number for another purchase. I recall having credentials on a different prepaid visa card in my notes, so I go look, unfortunately I didn\'t have the CVS code for it. I go back to the game, it had reloaded but I didn\'t get my gbucks. I was a little confused as the purchase had been confirmed, and the money was taken off my card. I tried contacting them 3 separate times about it but obviously they aren\'t vigilant of their customers and don\'t take them as a priority. I recommend playing the game but avoid spending money on it. If I could get some help and get a refund on my card, or the gbucks I originally paid for, I will give it 5 stars, as I would like to.',
       'I REALY LOVE this game but the only thing is that I\'m on level 10 and when ever I play in a battle and win I only get 200 gun bucks. PLZ can I have money transported to my account.My name is PRO_ADMIN.I would REALY HAPPY if you doüòï.By the way this is also for my FAMILY and they would love it if you do ):  . I am only 10 and I know I\'m asking for you to do a big thing but my family would really be happyüòä.My brother\'s acount is PROGAMER and he is only 6. PLZ if you don\'t reply or do something then it\'s ok ):  .',
       'I was loving it and have spent alot of money but this update made it to where i can\'t even open it back up. Please fix because i loved this game and have invested time and money and if i don\'t get to play it anymore sometime soon I\'m not coming today back. Please fix very soon i was trying earn a special gun but I\'m not sure if that\'ll be an option if an when it gets fixed',
       'After the Pro Play update, the game is a massacre. Unbalanced matchmaking rules the system. Players from better league confront newbies matches. I should have fight with players in my league. But the Pro Play update changes it to an unbalanced match. Now you lose two stars from my review. Please remove the Pro Play or replaced it as a ranked match. That would be better. Because ranked matches takes you against players in your league. Please fix this issue immediately so I\'ll change my reviews to 5.',
       'After level 30 the game is pay to win and after that level at least 90% of the battles the teams are unbalance. Pay vs free to play player. It is like if you don\'t use real money the game is punishing you with a handicap. Your armor and gun become less effective. If you are not planning to spend money on this game do NOT waste ur time.üëé',
       'Lunar festivals guns are a betrayal. You keep collecting cards to try your luck at the rulette but guess what... The card with the 300 pieces comes at last!!! I even bought cards with real money to confirm that and now i know. I am going to continue playing this game but you guys are not getting a cent from me anymore...;) Cheers...' ,

      'It had potential. Concept is cool. Huge money grab though. Literally watching ads any time you want to do anything. You can\'t even collect what you made without watching ads. I wish a different developer had had this idea, as they probably could have executed it without so much ad cancer.   Play a different idle game instead, there are hundreds that are much better that don\'t just spam ads until you delete the app, getting as much revenue off of you as possible.  Seriously. Just play a different one.',
       'Game is fun but there are just way to many ads. Like you open it up and you can chose to watch and ad to double your idle amount or not and you still get to watch an ad. You open one of the tabs in the game and you get to watch one. Then there are 3 different booster and you have to watch an ad to activate those and one only last 60 second. Then the game will glitch and sometimes you won\'t have and idle points. The game is fun and I like it but maybe ease up on the ads it\'s just too much.',
       'The game is cool but kinda stupid.  Because when I\'m in the game I don\'t progress, then when I leave my phone on to progress the game it freezes and deletes all my progress. And this is anoyying because I\'m near lvl 100 and it takes 20 minutes to complete each lvl. So when it puts me back like 8 lvls thats hours of progress that I lose. Other than that its a good game.',
       'At first the game was pretty fun. A good time waster if you\'re into that, but getting hit with ads every time I hit a button? It was fine for getting double rewards, or free boosters, or even when you hit a prestige.  However, I JUST loaded it up before putting this review and was hit with literally EIGHT ADS back to back before I closed the game.   It\'s not the first time it\'s happened over the last week and I\'m about to delete the game of it happens again.',
       'Great game but lots of bugs. Just got in the game and "collected" 1.3s of resources but my total stayed at 550U.i don\'t bother watching adds to double collection as after I\'ve watched the ad I get the same amount as if I\'d just collected it. Not sure if the 10x booster works as when it\'s active it only doubles the collect rate. Not sure if 6x tapping booster works as the timer hardly ever works and usually once it hits 0 the rainbow colour tapping sparks stay rainbow for hours. Can leave for a whole day and come back to pretty much the same level which then finishes in 10 minutes. Needs a lot of work to be good.',
       'I like the new prestige update, but it seems to have created a problem. All my prestige balls are locked in a pattern going from corner to corner and while the regular balls are collecting points when they hit the last remaining target ball, no points are deducted from the target ball. I can\'t advance to the next level. Add a button to re-randomize the balls if they get stuck and fix it so the regular balls deduct points like they are supposed to.' ,

      'Well guys.. I just broke the game üòÇ it was the \'HEADLIGHT\' puzzle where I got stuck. I requested for a hint and I accidentally tapped out the E in it and now it\'s completely gone. There\'s no letter E no more in there. You should check this out. (So I requested a hint twice, went wrong on the word and then tapped E, and poof, it\'s gone) and maybe you should make a reset puzzle button for situations like this. üòÉ',
       'Very easy, boring and full of unskippable ads for no reward. Not a very clever game as some have suggested, this gives the player no sense of accomplishment nor any legitimate challenge unless you do not speak English.',
       'Just got really boring. In a group of 10 puzzles there was; 1 that was a clever brain teaser, about 7 that were just way too easy and severely lacked creativity, and at least 2 that were just genuinely terrible often making little to no sense whatsoever and then it just turned into a game of hangman with unlimited guesses. Clearly this was made by a team or individual who thinks that they are supper clever and witty but in reality just wanted to make a few easy bucks by showering people with adds and a completely unnecessary currency system.',
       'The best time spent by playing this game ... Some are easy, some are funny, some are tricky, some are still out of the mind.... But it\'s a wonderful game and waiting for more levels to come now...',
       'After completing 55 levels I get a blank screen. Are there any plans to add new levels?',
       'Its a great gane but is always glitching out.For example I have three leters after I use a hint,then I earn a hint and the other letter just disapears and it did not go onto the word or phrase.' ,

      'This is the most addictive flight simulator I have ever played. The game is fairly easy to progress through without having to spend any money. If I had to find one fault it would be that you can\'t reverse when on a runway which means some times you have no option but to crash your plane as there is very little room to turn around.',
       'So I love the app but in free mode it will let you play.missions.. In a couple of the missions I have noticed it has given me 200 passengers to bring to a airplane boat (forgot what its called) and you cannot land a plane big enough for 200 passengers on it! No room to land without the wing getting clipped off by the tower and no place to take off from it! Other than that it is an awesome game',
       'A really good game to play if your board and have nothing to do. Its proberly one of the best flight simulators on mobile devices ive ever played. The graphics are acctually really good for a mobile game that runs smoothly. The controles can somtimes be wonky but youll get used to it. I love to play this game i really enjoy. The best thing about it is that, its FREE! Good job \'fun games for free\' üëèüëåüñí‚ò∫',
       'Was able to start playing right away because of the level of simplicity and yet you have to learn so you can challenge yourself in the more advanced campaigns that soon come up. The game will leave you finding out that a couple of hours has passed in a blink of an eye because of the fun you\'re having. I really just started the game so I will come back and update this in a few months as I advance in the game.',
       'I\'ve been losing sleep for days now playing this incredible game. Hahaha! Great graphics, smooth controls, realistic sounds, and easy-to-navigate interface. It doesn\'t force users to pay real money to fully enjoy and access the game. I wish the game offers a first-person mode where you get to play inside the cockpit and navigate the aircraft. That would be so much extra fun! Hats off to the team behind the game\'s development! :)',
       'Pretty cool app. I\'d like it more the planes/jets could be personalized with personal/or existing airline company names and if you could play commercial type flying modes. All without having to level up or earn money or pay real money for. Like a free fly mode. Oh,oh... and that there was real life situations that happen as a result of no fly zones and stuff. Otherwise it\'s pretty cool so far.' ,

      'It\'s a lot of fun but I\'d say about once every 3 tries, the app just crashes. It\'s pretty consistent too, I can\'t 5 minutes without at least 4 crashes. It\'s pretty quick to load back so it\'s still playable but it\'s definitely frustrating to have the restart the app constantly. One Plus 3',
       'IT DOENS\'T WORK ANYMORE!! It worked perfectly fine before the latest update. Now every time I open the app i doesn\'t load at all and after that it quits the game completely. Please try to fix this problem.',
       'It would be a perfect review but the thing crashes neat every 20 seconds. That is a fundamental part of the game working, that the game actually works (I know, pretty self explanatory). I honestly hopes this gets fixed because I do enjoy the game.',
       'It\'s okay but it\'s nothing special. Unfortunately it\'s another take on the type of game that gets popular every few years in which you throw stuff at a ball. That\'s it. There\'s unlockables, and they are possible to get without spending real money, but they don\'t add much to the game itself. Just a reskin of what you throw at the ball. It definitely killed some time for myself but after a day\'s worth of playing in my free time, I\'m already bored. Other reviews indicate the same.',
       'The levels need more diversity. After a while it just the same level just faster or slower spinning. Maybe add challenges or spinning platforms. Also if you could pick a color then choose  knife that would be awesome.',
       'I wonder is there a way to go back and replay levels? Im stuck on 1 and I notice I get coins even during fails, just a question,' ,

      'I love this game. Its and absolute tome waster and lovely to play. However, I had set my phone to the side to let it play out (as I was over 1400) and it reset on its own. I had cleared the screen the round previously so there was no chance of me losing to that. It was behind me and I never would have reset it. Is this some sort of glitch? If it is, please fix it soon. Aside from this, this is amazing.',
       'I really, really love this game, but, I keep losing my ball count and I don\'t understand why this is happening. For instance, I have 90 balls and I\'m supposed to have 92, I don\'t get the 92. I will give 5 stars until the bug is fixed. The ads I don\'t care about because that only happens at the end of each game which is ok. Please fix this so I can give you 5 stars.  Update- I figured out why I keep losing my count with my balls. Everytime I get the balls by the number blocks, it wouldn\'t count themüòê I could get a lot further if this was fixed. If this keeps on happening, I\'m going to uninstall this game. I hope it doesn\'t come to that because I really love this game. Please fix asap!!',
       'If I could give zero (0) stars for controls, that would be too high. The game is fun and addictive. But there is a restart button that there is NO REASON FOR. I have lost my progress three times with scores over 1000, which takes weeks to achieve. THE DEVELOPER DOES NOT RESPOND EVER. Uninstalling.',
       'It\'s good at first but you\'ll lose returning customers. Where are the power ups? Maybe an ultra bull that acts as 2 hits each turn. Nothing is drawing me back to and having me for higher school. In fact high score just means waiting longer. Could potentially be a great game.',
       'Best ever! Addicted to it. Cute graphics and fun color make it great! The aim-and-fire technique makes it original! Installed it 2 days ago, top score 72 average score 50!  P.S. If you like this app (which you probably do) try Amazing Thief! Great and another Ketchapp marvel! I\'m not spoiling it, but I will tell you it\'s a lot like Flappy Bird. If you don\'t know what Flappy Bird is, well then look it up.  P.P.S.  Anyone here would probably have at least SEEN Flappy Bird, but seriously. It is like an Aztec-age game.',
       'Both my husband and I have this game.  I opted to pay for the no ads though, he did not.  DO NOT do this!  He is able to get "continues" for watching adds and can keep climbing up the levels.  I cannot since I purchased no adds.  I get to continue once and that\'s all since I have stopped ads from allowing me to get the extra chances.  I wish I would have known this beforehand. Otherwise, this game is seriously fun and addicting.' ,

      'The original sonic dash is better imo. had a better atmosphere, maps looks better gameplay also better. the original was a masterpiece. also, I don\'t like that they introduce scenes that requires you to tilt your phone. since i played sonic dash i didn\'t expect it to be there. it\'s annoying when you\'re laying down and play the game and you got that scene just ruins the gameplay.',
       'Way too many advertisements. I actually downloaded this game because subway surfer makes start over everytime you download it but after my next tech upgrade I\'m going back to that, atleast the game not flooded with ads.',
       'The responsiveness of the controls I  this game make it unplayable... it\'s slightly more responsive than the original sonic dash but it\'s still no where near good enough for such a fast paced game.  I tested this on other devices before I posted this review and it\'s the same on all of them',
       'I would give it 5 stars, I made an in app purchase to remove ads, but after the game updated non Sega ads started showing again and it asked me to make another purchase in order to remove the non Sega ads AGAIN... love the game, hate the ads...',
       'TOO MANY ADS!! Decent game but ruined by an add every 20s. Sonic forces doesn\'t have half as many adds as this game but isn\'t as good so looks like Sega have fallen short trying to add more pounds to their fortunes and made the game unplayable.',
       'Ads are back. I paid for a red ring bundle, which did remove them for a while, but they\'re back. The only reason I made a real purchase was so that I wouldn\'t have ads, so can someone please remove the ads from my account. On another note, I really like this, and nice to see Shadow playable again.' ,

      'I\'m not far into it, but it\'s fun so far. My eyesight could be why it\'s not a 5-star experience. The more complex levels are very small and give me a headache after a couple of mazes. I believe the contrast and color schemes could be improved and make the game better. It\'s still a very good game though.',
       'Sublime controls, varying but very original and fun game modes, and an online leaderboard for the ones interested..!  I\'d easily rate this 5 stars if the white-on-grey theme didn\'t give me a headache! For the love of whatever God is out there, at least give the choice between a light and dark theme, PLEASE?!',
       'If you like doing mazes, then I highly recommend this game. It\'s by far the best maze game app I\'ve come across! Not only is it addicting, but it is fun and more challenging/authentic then any other maze games I\'ve tried. There are plenty of levels/modes to keep you entertained. It\'s the only maze puzzle app I\'ve found worth playing! üòÄüíú',
       'I love mazes and this game keeps me on my toes. Even though I haven\'t played it too long, an adult ad popped up that I felt was inappropriate. This concerns me because my 7yo daughter is also fond of mazes. Now I\'ll have to download a separate kid version for her.',
       '5 stars, the game does exactly what it should do, and the controls are simple and intuitive, but please, can you add a feature to prevent the screen from turning off? It messes a little when I try to mentally solve the classic mazes',
       'Where is the challenge? This game is as lame as the rest of the maze games. If you would  try make the game more challenging then maybe I would not have deleted it.' ,

      'Great game, Love it! Very creative, fantastic graphics. Not so difficult or loss of life\'s to where you can\'t even play.  Yet still challenging.  Only negative is lots of ads. Would gladly pay nominal fee to get rid of them.',
       'I really like this game but newer version I have updated to after 3 months and I see the Hooray Sound in the end and some more sounds in between has been changed to Ticking kind of sound.   I seriously and kindly request to the developer to restore those sounds which were there in old versions because I seriously loved it. I wish those sounds can come back which makes the game more amazing.   And ofcourse I still continue to play this and have hope for those sounds to be back.',
       'A truly fun, interesting & free game. A good game for any age. If you need to do something relaxing, this is a good way. You\'ll get hooked!!! I\'m in the 500\'s & it\'s still fun! The ads only require 1 more touch on the screen than you have been doing. Well worth it.',
       'Game is fine, ads are fine and can be avoided by not opening chests (not really needed to beat the levels) I\'m really hoping they increase in difficulty though, on level 50+ and that all seem to be fairly easy.',
       'Why played stressing games? I highly recommend this games for more relaxing & fun for resting your stress mind. Maybe developer can reduce the advert? It\'s kind a "too often".',
       'I\'m convinced the sole purpose of this game is to show you ads. After 40 levels, I find it almost impossible to lose. Keep playing if you love ads, and love to win.' ,

      'I love this game.  It\'s very simple, just go without getting hit by glass or running out of balls, but it is a lot harder than it sounds.  I am forever telling myself I have time for just one more attempt, it is very addicting.  The 3d design on this is amazing and creative.  Up at the top it says to write a SHORT review, so this will end here.',
       'Excellent game. Really superb game. Engaging play and the music works well. Plus fantastic breaking sounds. This game is both addictive and relaxing. Reminds me of the original wipeout. Another cool element is that each level adds interesting new elements. Only thing that would make it better is if my acheivements would track. Im on a galaxy s 7, and they don\'t track. At least my checkpoints save.',
       'I came across this app while I was browsing for more games. Looks very well designed and I\'ve decided to make room for this app. The very first time I played this game my mind was literally blown. Awesome music, fantastic design/graphics and very creative gameplay. It gave me a very good first impression that within 30 minutes into the game I\'ve upgraded to premium. The different game modes accomodate various type of players. The challenges are reasonable. Literally every aspect of this game is a success. The premium upgrade is worth every cent. Who need ads if you can give a very good first impression. A simple yet sophisticated game. Very well done indeed, a must for time killer!',
       'Really fun and addicting! The first time i saw this app was when my dad told me about this game, he said that it was very good. Literally the first 10 minutes i played this game my mind was blown and i beacame addicted. Around 2 years later(now) i found this game again and instantly installed it. I love this game and I have played it for a long time. The graphics and music are amazing. This a really good game and you should install it! Who could think that glass could be so fun. However I think this game would be better if some of the thing you have to pay for would be for free.',
       'So fun Great graphics and its super fun and addictive especially if you like beating your own score. I gave 4 stars because I paid the 2 dollars for the full version but I find that it doesn\'t save where I\'m at very well... Like if I leave the game and come back to it the last level I completed won\'t be saved. Other than that its really awesome and challenging. Hope I can get past level 8!',
       'It\'s very addictive, one thing I am pod about is that right from the get-go they\'re trying to get you to pay for it . It would have been nice if they didn\'t try to sell the premium version so quick. If anybody could have tried any other levels without being intimidated to pay for premium maybe I would have been sold to buy a premium. As of right now I\'m okay with playing classic. Maybe I\'ll think about premium ..' ,

      'Buyer beware, I purchased the "unlock all manicures" option less than a year ago, not only to unlock options but also to remove Ads for my kids. It\'s less than a year later, and ads are back, with an option to remove them for another fee. When paying just about 8 bucks less than a year ago, I find this distasteful. At least give a full year of ad free gameplay. Not impressed.',
       'So, this is an awesome, addictive and fun, satisfying game to play and it is really good if you want to become a nail artist. I would of gave it five stars but it is a bit unreal like you can just rub the nail varnish everywhere but it only appears on the nail but that can stop you from being annoyed because it is not as hard as it is in real life and one of my designs didn\'t go into my album because the game just got stuck and randomly stopped by its self and it went back to my home screen. Also there is too many ads. I am not interested! And you can\'t cross them off unless you download the app! What point is that?! And I cannot move and make the stickers bigger on match this so I can\'t complete it. Help! Sort this out!',
       'Its the BEST game I EVER played! Also, when I was 4, we didnt unlock anything. Now I am 17 and we have every thing for free! I love glitchs. Dont try to fix them though!  I love them and u sould 2. Peace out!',
       'I actually had this game a long time ago but have not rate this yet. At first all the colours were not unlocked yet so i was pretty disappointed. After a while everthing was unlocked so i was super excited. It doesn\'t get me board everytime i have different desins to do.',
       'A really nice game which also got me hooked up! Nevertheles, it frequently and automatically shuts down, deleting what was there.....this really broke my litlle sister\'s heart, even mine. For we were working on one for a long time and after one of thise repetitive ads, the app shut down.....',
       'Cute Its a very nice game. The best thing I liked in this game is that everything is already unlocked, we don\'t need to spend real money or even coins in the game. It has so many options for colours, designs and stickers. But it also has too many adds. On the whole I liked it very much' ,

Unless you\'ve got money to burn don\'t waste time grinding through ranks cause 45+ will best you down. Even if you do have the money to burn your still better off using it to keep warm as throwing it at this game will just give you the faintest satisfaction you\'ve accomplished something by simply having access to better cards then those you face.',

       'Since I\'m the last person who isn\'t cheating here\'s 3 suggestions... synch pvp so both players get the same energy. Temp ban every player generating more energy than possible in a game. Cheating players don\'t pay, they don\'t need to. This game would be awesome if 90% of the players weren\'t cheating. And a 3rd suggestion... synch pvp games so players get the same energy .',
       'Like the others say: Too much pay to win Lots of poor sportsmanship, without ability to block I\'m always paired against higher level opponents. If you like a game that is constantly difficult and irritating, play this. Also, install ES File explorer, and it will show you all the background ads they download on your phone!',
       'The constant loading screens are a pain. The fact that this game forces you to spend money to get better loot is horrible. The random loot lockers are awful, a lot of times the rewards you get are the worst, and even if you play a level several times there is no guarantee that you eventually would get better cards or upgrades from it. Even if you try to grind there is not much of a progress or reward from it. This is definitely a pay to win game.',
       'I have binged this game for only 30 hours and it does continue to entertain and challenge your playing tactics.  If you have a knowledge or love for the show then you will definitely want to see and hear the gameplay and special thoughts the developers put into making this South Park masterpiece!' ,

      'Pretty simple game. After doing a couple I realized a pattern with most of them and got to about 37 locks before I picked a "0 attempts" card. The hints provided the first digit but then I got 2 numers, both showed up in the "correct and well placed" section and the "two numbers correct" section along with the first digit. Both showed up in alternating spots between the two sections they were in. One of the numbers would provide me with 2 possible answers in the middle digit, the other provided 1 possible answer for the last digit. I figured it would most likely be the one without multiple answers but turned out it wasn\'t. And yes I checked the "nothing is correct" section many times. Not a great game, but its free.',
       'People saying that the puzzles have several answers are wrong. There\'s only 1 answer, you\'re just doing it wrong. It\'s a fun game, but when you\'ve finished a few levels you can breeze through the rest rather effortlessly because all the levels are built the same way, just different numbers. So you quickly learn how to crack it fast',
       'It\'s a neat concept, but the game fails in its execution. There can in fact be multiple solutions to a single puzzle, which is fine save for the fact that the game only accepts ONE OF THEM, and it is legitimately impossible to determine which is the "correct" answer as both answers are correct.',
       'Not sure if there is a chance you could get one with multiple answers I think I did but people make mistakes.  Good game over all and a fun challenge',
       'Sometimes there are multiple solutions but the game accepts only one.I lost because i had 2 attempts and there were 3 answers.I am quite a bit salty.',
       'I can\'t really play it because part of the hints are off screen. I have a tablet which may be part of the issue but idk.' ,

      'Some of the objectives are impossible complete. Like collecting the snowflakes in the big air. It\'s easy to find them but the locations they turn up make it impossible. And completing the rail slides in the halfpipe... I\'ve done more than enough board slides of every type and it won\'t complete. Still gave 5 stars though. The game reminds me of the original Shawn white pro snowboarding games.',
       'Thanks so much for the game, gave me hours of entertainment on car and plane rides, also helped me discover a couple old punk bands which is sick. A couple of small glitches in objectives you can\'t complete but oh well nothing huge',
       'Love the game. Disappointed that after making the quad exp purchase I am sti seeing ads. Kinda makes you not wanna play a game when you realize a developer is only out to nickel and dime customers to death...',
       'Really fun game with one glitch. Great graphics, great sound, really fun gameplay. However you cannot complete all the challenges. So as long as gamification completeness is not your goal and you can leave things showing as 14/15 complete then all is good.',
       'Ok so the last time I uninstalled was because the tutorial sucked and the menu was bad and the controls were horrific. Now with the new update, the same tutorials are finally finishable, the menu looks so much better. only thing keeping me from giving a five star are the controls, too sensitive',
       'This game is pretty awesome it does how ever have the glitches others have been having issues with and it has to do with certain objectives such as snowflakes on the big air levels and the slides on half pipe. If they could fix those issue I would for one rate 5 out of 5 and 2 I\'d be able to get 15 out of 15 on those levels and have a 100% completion. I can give further detailed bug specifics to admins if need be so these issues can be resolved especially since I paid for it so I really wanna finish these objectives.' ,

      'Cityville with better controls. Infact the developer has put their heart and soul to making the game  requiring as minimal input as possible and more enjoyment   Example would be re-seeding the farm. Click one farm and plant. A pop up appears on every farm to plant same crop. Just need to click  it. Same for supplying businesses',
       'I really enjoy this game.  It reminds me of Township, but of course it\'s unique in its own way. I do have some feedback that I\'ve noticed while playing.   It takes a very long time to level up.  I\'m almost at lvl. 12 and want to be able to expand more, but you either have to pay or just wait it out.  Also, some of the decorations, like trees and street signs, are expensive for no reason.  Finally, it is a little difficult to move items when in edit mode. Compared to Township, their edit mode is smoother, but overall, I do really love playing these types of games!',
       'It\'s a good game. Just that some of the quests really suck. Like the one I\'ve been working on for a week, have to collect 50 Fragile stickers. I have 20 Stationary stores, but when I collect from them I\'m lucky to get 1 or 2 Stickers out of 20 stores. It\'s REALLY FRUSTRATING.',

      'The game is very good but the thing is that when merlok is like "hmm, not sure if Ava gog all the bugs out..." and it tells me to go on the Nexo scan thing (it\'s the only thing i can do anyway because its forcing me to) and it plays the nexo scan sound with the screen dark at the same time and then it suddenly goes all quiet with the music stops playing and it does NOTHING!!!! ITS REALLY FRUSTRATING!!! FIX.   IT.    NOW!!!',
       'I played it on my Dad\'s phone, but only until I got my own tablet. But every time I try to play it on my tablet,(at the title screen)it crashes, and sez:Error. Unfortunately, MERLOK 2.0 has  crashed. PLEASE FIX THE ANNOYING ERROR!!!!!!!!!!!',
       'It\'s good except I keep trying to scan nexo powers but I don\'t knowonome of them        I put them bymy window so it\'s light enough and try to scan it for some reasons it doesn\'t work    other than that it\'s Excellent      Awesome       great     Love It',
       'My younger cousin really enjoys this game and it keeps him entertained for hours, which is gr8 as he has ADHD. The only problem that stops us from giving this game a 5 star rating is a small bug, on the fact that he can\'t get through to arronville which upsets and annoys him when the game crashes, please fix this problem as it would be a brilliant help to us. Thanks. Btw I would recommend this game , just beware of some small problmes but dont worry as they always update this app to sort these problems out.',

      'A very fun and addictive game. I make bows all day, but it\'s nice to be able to shoot from my couch at night.  The influence of wind on the arrow is accurate when it comes to drift. A little costly on the upgrades for those that don\'t buy their way to the top, but all games are that way.',
       'Ok game, but bingo mode is a huge pain.  My shots filled out the opponent\'s card better than mine.  Stupid way to lose a lot of progress/coins.',
       'Game was fine. Lately, keeps freezing and somehow opponents are getting 10\'s when I CLEARLY see them hitting nowhere near the middle. Matches are freezing while i\'m ahead, then match ends and says I lost. Somehow i\'ve lost 20 million coins, and not from legit losing either. I also just played a match for 1 million coins, i had over 1 million in the bank. I know sonehow have 0 after I clearly won the match but it said I lost. Either people are using cheats or the game is not functioning properly',
       'Good  game when it works. Seems to run out your  time  and  freeze  up  when  you start  winning  to  much',
       'DONT DOWNLOAD THIS GAME!!!  2-3 weeks ago i wrote very good review about this game. But since last week I understood that there are bots in the game. When the prize is lower your opponents will be from the real life as you. But when you are playing for the higher amount, your opponent will be bot who scores in 1 second without aiming. DEVELOPERS, THIS IS FRAUD!!! I SPENT HOURS ON THIS GAME AND MY BUDGET WAS ALMOST 12 MILLION. BUT BECAUSE OF THE BOTS (USUALLY NAMES LIKE SAMUEL, ALEX, KATIE, BRUNO AND PROFILE PICTURES ARE CATS OR DOGS) I LOST ALL MY MONEY. AND DO YOU KNOW WHAT IS STUPID? YOUR OPPONENT SCORES 10 TWO TIMES IN 1 SECOND AND JUST BECAUSE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE THINKS THAT IF YOU LOSE YOU WILL HAVE NO MONEY LEFT, SUDDENLY YOUR SUPER HERO OPPONENT SCORES 8 TWO TIMES AND LOSES AGAINST YOU!!! YOU ARE COMMITING FRAUD!! DELETED THE APP ALREADY!!',

      'I like the app in all, but I have some points I would like the developer to take into consideration. When a new game starts, it would be better to start with the "mine" option on and not the flag (so that you can open a new tile and not set a flag randomly), even if the flag was the last option used in the previous round. I also believe that in hard mode the game is made too random and not that skill-demanding. Other than these points it\'s nicely done!',
       'I love that this game has been ported so smoothly to the phone. The most interesting part of this game is the ads, or rather, the option of ads. In since this game is free it includes ads, but you can turn them of, or change the kind of ad that you get. For this reason, i actually had the ads on, because i think the developer deserves the money he/she gets from choosing such a great system. Sadly i cannot speak for everyone. Good game.',
       'Pretty good, would like a little better graphics though, and sometimes when I go to hold it registers as a tap. Maybe it\'s just my phone. Also I\'m not sure how close it is to the PC version (scale and such) and would like it closer. But I know its hard on a phone screen. Maybe if you made the rotation horizon, you can match the PC layout more (with the different sized boards that the PC version has)',
       'Overall the app is really great. It\'s the same concept as the original PC version with just some slight changes to make it work for a touch screen. The only downside is that since you\'re not playing with a mouse you have to click a button at the top of the screen every time you want to switch between planting flags or revealing spaces vs using the right or left mouse buttons. But I see no way around this on a smart phone or tablet. Also, there are very minimal ads, which is awesome.',
       'One of my favorite games ever!  I am glad to see it available for my phone!!!  However:  I do not like the constant switching between marking a flag and clearing a space, because I keep blowing up mines I am trying to mark, from being in the wrong mode.  A tutorial to explain the settings and the flag/clear switch would be nice.  Using a long press to flag a space and a tap to clear it would be even better.  I would like to be able to set the bomb number myself.',
       'While this certainly is minesweeper, there are some serious design flaws. First off, when you click the first cell the board does not seem to generate around that, meaning that 80% of games on medium you will loose randomly opening squares trying to get a start. Hard mode is literally unplayable, as the mines are so dense it turns into a guessing game. There are better minesweeper apps out there.' ,

       'Loved it.but make it offline plz',
       'Controls are odd. There should be an air roll button to make it easier to land on your wheels. Actually make it online too, that might be pretty neat. I wouldn\'t say it\'s very much like rocket league other than the fact there\'s a ball and you have to score in the opponents goal. Still a lot of work required to come anywhere near it. Also at times the ball just flies across the map when barely touched or landed on.',
       'Ok I changed my review from a star to a 2 star, due to the fact that this game is NOT an online game as it misleads you to think. You can turn off your mobile data and the hands still runs without a hitch. They wee so far as to randomize behavior of the AI. By that I mean in done matches your opponents or team mate will just stop, implying an AFK event. Anyway its a fun game Bhutto don\'t be a sham Devs.. Mean what you say and say what you mean..',
       'I think it would be great if the game didn\'t keep freezing on me after 2 minutes of starting it. I\'m sure it\'s not my phone because I just bought a brand new phone and it\'s been brilliant for me in every aspect and all other games are working fine. Plus the phone has a 4gb ram. I don\'t know how much more you might need',
       'it\'s just like rocket league. I love it. but may I ask something? is it an online game or am I playing against bots because there is no challenge.  but if you the developer\'s make the graphics better and have the first event free I promise to continue playing. good job on the game and keep at it can\'t wait for the full game. also I see you guys answer every comment but it\'s always the same. can you answer me maybe give me some tips or advice on the game and tell me when the next update will be thanks:)' ,

      'This game is ok. The graphics are good. It\'s my favourite bowling game out there.  However I really don\'t know why this needs access to my phone contacts and other permissions.  As a result it\'s been removed. Apps and games need to sort out their permissions for what it needs to do. If it\'s not required I\'m not installing it. Other than that complaint it\'s actually a nice game for a quick 5 minute time waster.',
       'I just installed it and played one game. Seems simple and entertaining but it\'s WAY too soon to give a fair rating. It\'s annoying when games are begging you for ratings  before you can even have a chance to explore the game.',

      'Its really good BUT I can\'t get past this one training session with my foals. It just seems silly that I can\'t get past it because its really simple. I read another review before downloading the app which had the same problem. Also I think that there should be some more breeds that are quite well known (eg Thoroughbreds  or üíñStockhorses üíñ)  pretty good game all round.',
       'I hate how we have to pay to transfer the horses to the game. Not everyone can pay ya know? This app should cost no money at all since we pay so much for star coins/star rider already. Please be considerate or I\'m gonna have to drop both games cause I can\'t afford to pay for both.',
       'It\'s a nice and cute little game but I can\'t get past level three because I can\'t seem to get this one quest done, it\'s the training one were you teach the horse little tricks, I get to the last one and I try to completr it but I keep getting it wrong.',

      'So I\'m changing my review. After the past few updates I have won more special dice!! They lowered the level from extra impossible to meduim on the dice Masters, so it\'s a tad bit more fair! The only problem need, is the daily challenge is too much for the app to stay open. It force closes due to over processing or something, and I\'d rather not have the daily challenge and the game work lol. But definitely gaining more stars each update from me!!',
       'Too many ads, basically requires you to buy dice. Literally the only way to ensure a win is to have dice for re-rolls. This wouldn\'t be a problem except you\'ll hardly ever win dice with the scratchers, and when you do it\'ll be one.  It\'s all a cash grab, and the ads every 3 or 4 rolls are intrusive, frequently locked in, and always very annoying. Gameplay itself is simple but just way too many ads.',
       'The rating would be higher if I didn\'t have an app stopping every throw of the dice for a solid week.  My score suffered drastically,  so be yours....',
       'I have been playing both . I am playing old version. I like better .I will go back to the new version to play challenges ..roll a few dice ...it seems to have slower game play .  .new versions gets  glitches . Keeps crashing .. that\'s annoying ??..! ? Time to keep playing on the old version..if you want to try new version just install separate .  New version you push to roll and then there is a 1 or 2. Second delay . To slow',
       'I would totally give this game 5 stars it is a great game and i love playing. But it keeps crashing. It crashes and restarts in the middle of my roll!!! Its very irritating and if it keeps doing it i will uninstall the game.',
       'Honestly, I adore Yahtzee, but this app has FAR too many ads.  These ads cause the game to severely lag, making for very unenjoyable gameplay.  I understand that app-makers get their money out of free apps only because of the ads, but this is just beyond ridiculous and completely ruins the fun of the game.' ,

      'Grab your squad and get ready to win in the Daily Team Goal! Choose friends and fellow Yahtzee players to join your team and work together to reach daily goals. Complete your goals and you and your team will earn prizes! Everyday there\'s a new goal and everyday there\'s a new team - start playing now!' ,

      'Several times now I\'ve tried to type in a logo name and the app has told me I got it wrong but I thought it was right and couldn\'t see why I was being told I was wrong. So I hit "solve" and the answer is exactly what I typed in.  I have also had a few times now where I\'ve recognised the logo but there are letters missing when I try to type in the name.  I had what I suspect to be this app deferral years ago and had no problems with it at all but since this new look and expanded number of logos has appeared it feels like you\'ve ruined a fun app. Any chance of fixing this screw up?',
       'Several times I have tried to use a hint and it  wouldn\'t take it off and it was difficult and easy. When I type in the logo it would tell me I\'m wrong then I hit solve and it was the same thing I wrote also and if people don\'t know some of the logos what is the point of the game.',
       'It is both difficult and easy to play and also this game has different types of logos so if we don\'t know one we can just know it by this game. It is wonderful for me because there is not a single problem. It doesn\'t seem to be bad for me i  meant the game was not at all bad and it was particularly different from some of the reviews means some people said this game this and that but it doesn\'t seem to me the same thing because each of us has a different choice but according, to me it was great, amazing, wonderful game. Thanks for making this types of games and it is good because it teaches us something so thx once again. üòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòäüòÄüòÄüòÄüòÄüòÄüòÄüòÄüòÄüòÄüòÄüòãüòãüòãüòãüòãüòãüòãüòãüòã',
       'First Level at Barbie and Twitter, even if type the words correct, the app tells me that there\'s a mistake. Solve shows me exactly the same word I\'ve typed in before',
       'It\'s too easy to amass a huge number of hints and use them. I\'d like not to be able to complete every level without doing some online searches.',
       'This app is nice. One thing I like about this app is it takes only one single unit to give a random letter hint because I have seen in many apps that they take 60 or 90 coins or whatever unit to just show a letter and this app haves daily bonus 30 coins so I love this app but I think that the app members should give a little attention on the animation because it is not so clear. Besides this all all the best for the team of this app and make good apps further.' ,

      'Too many Ads. I realize there\'s a purchase option for no ads, I don\'t want to spend money a centuries old game. The ads are distracting and the reason I\'m opting for another. There will always be another app without ads, so I don\'t know why you have to be a capitalist douche and force payment.',
       'Well done. Love this app. Lots of options in the settings which greatly enhances its flexibility. AI is challenging but not impossible to beat. Lots of levels therefore can gradually crank up the difficulty as you get better. Only thing missing is a 3-D option unless I\'ve somehow missed it in the settings.',
       'Too much annoying ads! The game as great before the update few days ago. The ads now auto play and cannot go back to the game as by pressing back button during the ads like before. The ads play itself and ut off my music playback every time and the game did not make the playback continue after the ads. It\'s so annoying Everytime you finish the game the ad pops up and play its video then cut off your music and you have to press play on your music app again and again. If you put the ads to get money that\'s fine but PLEASE mute them so the ads won\'t cut off the playback music that I am listening or if you let the ads auto play please make the game playback the music after the ads. I will not rate 5 stars till this issue has been fixed.',
       'One of the best graphics available (simple and classy), but the amount of adds became ridiculous. Algorithm for levels is not working properly (same levels vary too much). Also, it could improve tutor.',
       'Requires Google Play Services to have access to lots of unnecessary privacy related information for the Achievements to work. Unacceptable! Minus 1 star for that. It amazes how much personal information people are willing to hand over to play a "free" game. Great chess app otherwise.',
       'Best chess app. Don\'t think twice before trying it. I\'ve tried a dozen similar apps and found myself using this one for over 2 years across 4 devices.' ,

      'This app won\'t load at all. My son really wanted to play it. He was very exited only to be very disappointed.  I tried deleting and downloading it again but it still did the same thing. I would not recommend this app because all it does is disappoint.',
       'This is a good game and would be great if the controls would respond every time.  When you are playing a game where responsive controls matter, having them fail about every 20th swipe is unacceptable.  The other disappointing thing is that Batman is the only one that says anything.  I worked my way to get Robin and when he didn\'t say anything, I was completely turned off from the game.',
       'Boring and repetitive and poorly designed. The obstacles are hard to see. After starting a (new) stage, you don\'t have enough time to avoid the very first obstacle. The rooftop stage is unfair, you cannot avoid obstacles because either the controls don\'t work or because you don\'t have enough reaction time. And restarting from the beginning gets very boring very quickly.',
       'Terrible, absolutely terrible, and I was so looking forward to playing this game. I love the Lego Batman Movie and I am so devastated to download this game to only see that it crashes almost every time I try to play it, and when it does work, pressing play leads just to a black screen. Highly recommend that if the game doesn\'t work for you, don\'t bother reinstalling it, because it\'ll do nothing and isn\'t worth your time sorry to say. If it works for you, which I have seen happens in the comments sometimes, lucky you, wish it did the same for me. Basically you are able to play it or not at all and can\'t change anything after.',
       'Love batman, I live for anything lego... this is an utter failure. The first level is beyond difficult for a seasoned veteran. Game to difficult, plot line staging is beyond negligent and shame on the creators for designing such an impossible game to progress through.',
       'It wouldn\'t even load past putting in my son\'s age. He is very disappointed. He earned the game and I uninstalled a bunch of my own apps to make room for the app.' ,

      'This is a very addictive enjoyable game. You can learn new moves, create the looks of your character and get some wonderful backup dancers to impress the judges and much more! The only reason I gave it 4 stars is that lots of things are locked and when I payed, they were unlocked for a while then locked again. Please fix.',
       'One time I just played dance clash 2 months ago. But now I decided that I had to uninstall the app because I am dine playing this game. But now I decided that pretty ballerina what better than dance clash. Also gymnastics superstar was good. But I can\'t do all of those moves just like a real gymnast. That\'s all I have to say',
       'Ughhh Its really ok ...but the Ads omg...i wanted to throw up...i checked out  all the other coco games  and figured out this.. you people are giving us the same avatar!!!!!. Can u beleive that ! And after u get one dress for free after watching that stupid 20 sec. Video u people lock all the othet things.. this game is really nice and i loved the graphics but u could do somethingfor ALL of those LOCKED ITEMS ...AND UNLOCK THEM FOR US!!!!!!!',
       'The picture of the dance moves do not correlate with the action. There is no fluidity with the moves. I think there should be a partner. To the eyes are still messing up when putting on the makeup.',
       'Very bad game......... When 1st time I see it I wish that I download it. But when I download it I was very angry that when I open it.no dress I can wear to ballerina I was very angry. The problem is that when I click on any dress the game give me stars but not show the dress.......I\'m not uninstalling it plz set this problem.....plz',
       'Hey coco! I just have one problem with the game.  1.Everytime it loads the loading screen, it freezes and i have to exit the game again and i dont get my results. I dont know if its my phone or your game! Either way, Do you mind fixing it?  Thanks  Love,JGüíúüíô‚ù§üíúüíô‚ù§üíú' ,

      'This game has highly disappointed me.  It was super fun and interactive at first then it gives you the option to pay to continue to play or to complete free offers to unlock the game for free.  I have found that you can complete as many offers ad you want but the game won\'t ever unlock and emailing the support web site doesn\'t do any good either. They don\'t ever respond and it is a complete waste of time.  Don\'t waste your time on this game.  Go out and find yourself something worth playing because this surely isn\'t it.',
       'DO NOT DOWNLOAD CAN NOT BE COMPLETED DUE TO A BUG!!!!!!  After buying you eventually get to the accordion level just before leaving the prison roof only for one (or 2 on some phones) ball being outside the play area which makes the mini game impossible.  Many reviews all over the internet highlighting this bug but the developer has not bothered to fix it.  AVOID THIS DEVELOPER !!!!!!!!!!',
       'It was super fun and interactive at first then it gives you the option to pay to continue to play or to complete free offers to unlock the game for free.I tried  to complete many offers such as surveys, installing a playing another game for certain level, but this game never unlocked no matter what! They don\'t ever respond and it is a complete waste of time. This game has highly disappointed me.',
       'It\'s fun in the begin it has a great starting puzzles.. they are challenging but interesting.. until you get to put your plans in place and then find out you can\'t continue unless you pay for hints or you do unnecessary task using other apps.. I found this feature pointless because I don\'t even use the hints but the producers are making me extra hard to get them.. it\'s a bunch of b.s. at this point I am unhappy with how they set this part up.. don\'t install you\'ll be disappointed unless you have money to spend that for no reason',
       '"Free" version lets you play minimal levels. I then completed 2 different offers to get the whole game. After spending an hour on each offer, still haven\'t been given access to the full game. Game is a joke and makers are a fraud. Waiting for something to happen to my info that was added to the offers.',
       'Game is ok.  Tasks are sometimes unclear.  After a few tasks you have to pay to keep going or complete some offer.  Tried several times, but never lets me continue.  Should say it\'s a trial version in description.  No clue how it got a 4+ star rating.' ,

      'The game is buggy and needs some work. For me the game does not go ahead and it points on Unlocking the chest when the other chest is in process of Unlocking. None of the functions work, clearing cache, dalvik has no impact. Game works only after uninstall and again install.  Edit : the game is super smooth now . The shadow energy required to upgrade an element is increased manifold without corresponding increase in drop chances of epic and legendary chest. Hence a star removed.',
       'Hey,  Guys install it it\'s fun to play shadow fight 3.  NEKKI I loved the game but it got uninstall by me and I again installed it but it asks to download an additional file that is too done by me but when the file gets completed (15mb) the game doesn\'t start it remains on 15mb only.  Please see the issue and inform me.',
       'I have given 5 stars earlier because it was early in the game. Even in chapter one, you can\'t really progress because there is no way to make more coin other than the side quest which needs hours to refresh. In the end, you kinda not able to do anything but wait. You can\'t even replay earlier fights to earn some coins. Different mechanics than the 2. Boo.. Uninstaling..',
       'Few suggestions: 1. Add an escape roll or a quick recovery move when downed 2. Beating an opponent in duel should reduce the opponent\'s trophies. It will help in balancing match ups that appear in duels 3. Add an option to discard chests after winning a duel. It\'s most definitely a pay to win game  right now.. hope it gets better',
       'Controls have been ruined with the latest update. They are responsive only for a few moments in the beginning. You are ruining the game with every update Nekki. Every fight in the main quest shows impossible and insane levels. Our 15 hits is equal to 3 hits of other players. It seems very hard to play the game without spending money. I have only stuck to the game because of the story, otherwise I would have deleted it too earlier.',
       'The game is cool and action packed but the only way to level up is to play the main campaign and there are no achievements with rewards to help you out. Also the ai difficulty seems like it knows your next move and not only that but each level is so much harder than the last. Plz fix' ,

First spot was under the ottoman, second spot was under some pillows, third spot was inside the closet/pantry and all 3 times I was able to locate it with ease. I didn\'t have to whistle crazy loud and I didn\'t have to search too long to find my phone either time. This is a great app for those of us who always lose our phones. App needs to stay on in the background to work and you have to listen/watch a few ads to get going but it\'s definitely worth it.',

You will become a constructor who is required to improvise and ‚Äì most of all ‚Äì adapt to the task at hand. Use your resources to construct structures able to hold the weight of a car.¬†Try to become a good builder as fast as you can - things will get hard. You won\'t be racing against the time, so be a careful and thoughtful constructor.You will design and construct increasingly elaborate bridges across four varied locations. Each one is a different logic puzzle for a thoughtful builder. Things may seem easy when you start out in a city, but once you move to the canyon, valley and finally mountains it will get hard. The task is never impossible, but the size and resilience of your structures will have to increase substantially if you don\'t want to be responsible for a car crash. Use your logic and skill to become a master bridge builder and break some records along the way!In addition to the normal mode Bridge Construction Simulator offers an easy (for an increased budget and more flexibility) or hard one (for an ultimate, seemingly impossible puzzle challenge that will be able to break even the best builder). There is something for a constructor of every skill level. If you find yourself in a tight spot, a hint system will help guide you to the solution and help you build your skill as a builder. Use the help provided to construct bridges that will not break.The game is a simulator that makes extensive use of realistic physics. As the car drives through the construction you\'ve built you will see it stretch and bend. That way even if you fail you can see the weak points of your construction and use your logic to improve it. Build with your brain and you will be good.Realistic and detailed graphics make every level of Bridge Construction Simulator come to life and even offer a slight consolation when you fail as a constructor. Because when your bridge collapses and the car falls down, you can at least expect a spectacular crash! Just enjoy it and don\'t let it break you - muster your skill and try again! Nothing is ever impossible for an ambitious constructor. Play and become a legendary bridge builder!Game features:- Superb physics - a true simulator - Multiple addictive levels across four different worlds- State of the art realistic graphics- Fantastic, varied and detailed environments - you won\'t get bored as you build - Spectacular special effects- Mind bending, challenging puzzles requiring the use of thought and logic - Varying skill levels for increased challenge or more relaxed gameplay - something for every constructor - Built-in hint system helps you build your skill',

      'Money hungry devs. Makes promises to VIPs but don\'t deliver. Shoddy customer service with all answers given off a script but never really answer your concerns. Take plenty, give SFA back. Battery draining, laggy and constant bugs. Best decision I just made was to cancel my membership based on the fact that these people really do not GAF about their players, especially their VIPs when it is not a cheap membership to have.',
       'Definitely pay to win. Keeps kicking me out after doing about 2 levels. When you scroll up or down it thinks you are clicking on something. Stamina is a nightmare as when you reach a high enough level that takes more xp to level up, you can\'t play for hours as it takes to long to recharge. Other than that pretty good.',
       'Pay to win game. In reality you have to spend between 500-1000$ to get a decent deck for one deck (5 different element decks). Drop rates in packs are miniscule and cost around 44$ for a pack with 9/10 3 star and 4 star maximum cards. (Cards that are useful have a max of 6 stars). Customer support ALWAYS chooses money over the player.',
       'Well built foundation and cool artwork. But the stamina choking is absolutely inexcusable. As soon as level ups aren\'t regularly replenishing stamina get ready to play two levels every few hours. When are mobile game devs gonna realize this isn\'t an arcade, I\'m not putting in quarters just to *play* your game. If I loved your game, *maybe* I would spend money to buy a really cool rare unit, but never something as trivial and fleeting as stamina. Stop ruining your game\'s potential with such greedy freemium models.',
       'Everything, especially the text, is blurry. Graphics aren\'t big enough/high enough quality to look nice at 1440p. At the very least you guys need to replace the text to work better on high-res displays because it looks amateurish and outdated to be that blurry.',
       'Ok game but has annoying things like it pauses my music I\'m listening to even when I mute their music and check the box to use my own music. Everytime I open the app or go back to it, it pauses my music, and it keeps selecting items, cards or anything when I\'m just trying to scroll up or down the page. It keeps getting annoying when trying to get to the campaign and it selects different dungeons or whatever I am trying to scroll past.' ,

      'The game controls are very annoying. The character won\'t go where you want him to. During the boss fight he keeps getting stuck near the door even though I press the control for him to move forward. Plus the controls on the right hand part of the screen are too close to the controls on the phone, so if your finger moves a but too much other apps are popping open when you don\'t want them to and the game app is closing. Found the jumping upward on level 2 very awkward. Character didn\'t want to move forward during the jumps. So your continuous trying to climb and starting over if you miss a jump.',
       'Maybe the reason people think its boring. It\'s probably because they are boring and lame. I beat the first level without a problem, they didn\'t because they feel like everything should be easy and they shouldn\'t have to work hard for anything. The game is challenging and fun if you like a challenge. If your a lame, whinny, expect nothing to be hard, and can\'t handle a challenge as tough as making toast, then this game isn\'t for you.',
       'These other reviewers are jerks! Lol. The game is awesome! And my 4 year old can even play it well!  I like it so much, I\'m downloading it onto my phone (4 yr old plays it on my old phone)  just to see how far I can get lol',
       'NC and you know what you doing today beautiful lady and her husband to be with u but I can\'t wait till I see you in the car and my mom said she will be here for me to go to the store and get a chance to get a chance to get a chance to get a chance to get the money for the first time I was just wondering if you want to be a good day at work and I don\'t know what I',
       'This game is stupid because you have to get a part of the key just to get more lives and the bad guys are technically cheating because they have guns I made it to the last level and it was impossible to beat the boss because he puts fire everywhere on the second level the guy keeps shooting you so it took me an hour to get off that stupid level  it took me about five days to get of the last level but I suggest that you just play the first level. This was a ripoff it doesn\'t make sense to wait that long for a stupid freaking game I\'m to cool for that dumb game. Another thing that is stupid about the game is the remote controls its confusing because they all look the same they should put the names of what that control does in the buttons. And the thing builds the stuff for you at a scale of 1 to 10 I pick 1  I rather play with realistic legos than the iPad ones don\'t waste your time on waiting for the game to download  its a ripoff',
       'It is awsome I love how on the last level (the black night) has two levels the black night and the vampire  the whole game is so fun I\'m done the whole game still play it all the time  but it needs more levels love it so much  so it needs MORE LEVELS' ,

      'Great game for its genre. However it desperately needs some events maybe a daily login bonus and some form of vip ladder. I like the nostalgic of the old game but I feel like the developers made the game and just walked away from it. Please for love of games add new stuff and throw some events to us who are almost maxed out. This happens and I\'m totally cool with a 5 star rating',
       'Best game in years and I especially love the character jam and there are many more for you to collect they are worth the get even when your scroundging around for the last few characters. Also it\'s crazy how much they throw at you for watching an ad It can give you 20 diamonds to 8 hours of cash it\'s insane',
       'Fun game, cool animations and graphics. Good music and sound effects. Can you help with diamonds and sell out features just a tad bit more. I enjoy the game. Awesome job developers and programmers. Nice twist on the classic crazy taxi game',
       'This is a great time killer. It\'s a pretty fun game and easy to play. My only complaint is that you have to watch a zillion videos to get bonuses, which really wouldn\'t be that bad if you got the bonuses after watching the videos. It seems like the higher the level I reach the more frequently this happens. Fix this issue and I\'ll give it 5 stars.',
       'Great game, it\'s fun to play. Would rate it higher, but it often crashes when I\'m trying refuel or double my earnings by watching ads. Then the game restarts, and I can\'t refuel for awhile, or I list the bonus earnings. FRUSTRATING!!',
       'I was playing a game when this ad came up with a fake X so that it would take you to the play store. I hate shady practices like this so I installed it just so I can give you this review. Enjoy your single freak\'n star!  PS This is not a review of the game itself and I could care less at this point. This review is on this games advertisment tactics.' ,

It\'s not an effective strategy...and no parent would download another budge game after seeing one ad a minute.',
       'Don\'t buy anything in the app cuz it doesn\'t sinc with other devices and when you complain NO ONE responds back! This app won\'t get another penny from me cuz you\'re a rip off! And if it wasn\'t for my granddaughter liking ponies, I\'d delete the app all together! Seriously crappy customers Service!!!',
       '"drag and drop the broken bits into the right place" game locks up and little 4 year old girl cries. Now I know why these games get hacked by little sisters older brother. People get pissed. Enjoy your money budge!',
       'My kid loved this game. She got really into it and was loving every moment, but then a part of the game wouldnt let her do anything. It was a boss scene on a pinkie pie level and a drop and drag boss on a rarity level. The game simply wont do anything and hence she cant get any farther. This is frustrating as i paid for all the stuff for it as she enjoyed it so much and its beginning to feel like i paid for my kid to be sad. Please fix!',
       'Let\'s talk about ads. I downloaded this for my kid. She would love it except for the fact that EVERY 30 SECONDS THERE IS AN AD! I realize that\'s how money is made, but that\'s ridiculous. One at the end of each level would be fine, but this 4-5 inside the level is overkill. And they play upside down. She spends more time trying to exit the ad than playing the game.',
       'AMAZING Now don\'t blame me for loving this, I know there is not many levels, too many ads, but this is very active for kids. It can make thier reflex better! Can season 2 just come out already?' ,

      'What moron developers design a \'spot the difference\' app which (obviously) requires being able to use the whole screen, but then plaster the top half of the screen with ads? How can I spot the differences when I can\'t see them!?  Shite. Uninstall.',
       'Using galaxy note 8 and the graphics are all skewed. I keep getting docked lives and having to restart  a level because the circle of off to the side of where the difference is. What\'s the point? It would be awesome if I could actually play it.',
       'The idea of the app is very nice, however, I am disappointed in the fact that the app requests to access my calls, contacts, and other data. I fail to see why is that necessary for a simple game like this. Moreover, when I listen to music and play the game, the ads come interrupting my music with their own. When I mute them and press X, the music on my phone stops completely, forcing me to leave the game and start the music again. Again, this is inconvenient for an app which I expected to be very simple.',
       'It seems that the touch is way off on my Galaxy S8, when i touch the differences i get a X, but get O for random spots mid-screen! This would be a great game if i could actually play it!!!',
       'This apps cool but being new to Samsung being a former apple person. I\'m not understanding why the games want to access your private things..calls pics etc?',
       'Slow and a little mind numbing. Ads cover the top picture so you have no choice but to hit hint otherwise you would never know there\'s a difference.' ,

      'Absolutely love this game. Becoming addicticed already, had this game for 4 days and I love the tapping where if you use more than 1 finger it goes faster. So my family thinks I\'m crazy sitting there with my hand tapping the screen so fast, they even said "slow down there matey you\'ll break your screen of you keep going like that" long story short, now I have a cracked screen but vwry am addicted. Great game fingersoft keep up the good work',
       'It\'s fun building up stuff and I like how the game keeps playing even when closed.   One thing that annoys me, I try to watch the ads for free in game currencey, but most of the time either the ad crashes or the game is reset when I close the ad and I don\'t receive in-game currencey. Probably my potato Moto G5 doesn\'t have enough RAM. Another fingersoft game, HCR2 has the same concept and doesn\'t have this problem.',
       'I somewhat enjoyed this time wasting game until one of the characters (robots) I purchased for millions of coins just left, and sent me a picture to share with friends.  From there I had to spend another million coins to buy a human who had less skill.   Not worth playing a game that takes your hand earned characters away for no reason.',
       'I love this game but I found a bug, I don\'t know how exactly it happened but I was doing an extra task (a clown factory dice making one) I used auto clicker and was just holding one finder down and tapping to sell with the other. Now all of my factories have a die on each person\'s desk and it doesn\'t go away once sold. Other then that, great game and nice timewaster. :D',
       'It\'s a great time killer if you are waiting or have nothing to do. It does get boring after 3 and a half hours,but it\'s still good. Also way less and I mean way less ads than other games. Excuse my spelling and grammar, but you know what it means. (It\'s good)',
       'The only thing I don\'t like about this app is the controls. You can\'t hold your finger to make production faster. You have to tap constantly. But other wise, it was a great app and I recommend it\'s' ,

      'It\'s good.. but they really try and rake you over the coals... everything is waaaayyyy overpriced and theres obviously a huge emphasis on pay to play..  However... the actual gameplay is straightforward, collect gems and get the ball in the hole before your opponent. It\'s fun for about 20 minutes a day. And the freebies could be a little better, but again I get the emphasis on the pay to play/be competitive. Overall great game mechanics and solid game play. Definitely give it a try if you have half am hour or so to kill.',
       'This is basically a golf clash rip off.  Very bad mechanics and view points.  You cant spin the camera angle which makes for very awkward shots and also makes it so you cant do a full swing when shooting from left to or right to left because you run out of screen.  Oh and wind adjustment in a putt-putt game is just stupid, not to mention the wind affects are very buggy.  This game sucked.',
       'Game is not right. People with lower balls and clubs can shoot further then higher ones? A lot of glitches. Ball guide lines show that you clear obstacles and when you take the shot, you hit the obstacle. When fixed, might rate better.',
       'Great game, but people and game cheats. If you have more gems, the lower amount wins? Fix this please. I\'m tired of losing and tired of getting knocked off the course or my gems stolen',
       'Actually enjoy but I keep getting shut off when I\'m playing! I\'m very disappointed with how the coins disappear when in the middle of a game. I\'ve been cheated out thousands of coins when I was on my winning shot too. So very uncool.',
       'It always seems that luck favors your opponent and gold is extremely hard to come by,  It would be nice if they gave you gold rewards for achievements but that\'s where their money grab is. Some courses have bugs in it\'s extremely frustrating, Win or lose money always seems to be pretty tight.' ,

      'Honestly I think it\'s amazing that they sell this game for free because it is one of the best games I\'ve ever played in my life. It doesn\'t take any internet and the animals in details so good and the graphics. If you\'re ever bored you should download this game and play it all the time.',
       'Highly addictive. I love this game but there is one fault that it doesn\'t allow your device to enter sleep mode. I have ruined 2 phone screens with burnt in images because of this. I would fall asleep playing the game and when I wake up it\'s still on the screen.  I also don\'t understand why the special games are not offered on the Facebook game.',
       'I adore this game. However, I have had 7 gold bars for over a year and every time I win a level that awards lots of gold bars the game tells me my bank is full... even though everything costs at least 9 gold bars. According to my math I should have over 100 bars. I would settle for two at this point.',
       'Love it love it love it....1/218..this is still one of 3 of my favorite games but... you have this golden piggy who collects gold bars.. i have filled it several times but then i find out you want me to pay for them after winning them... NOT HAPPY...',
       'Sometimes it feels like the difficulty of the levels is way off. Levels labeled "hard" or "super hard" are many times much easier than standard levels. I do enjoy the amount of unlimited lives given, and the speed at which lives are replenished, however. Overall, a good time-passer',
       'Previous prob:( Keeps on "Loading"). Also, it said 12 hours of unlimited play and I only got 3. 2/10/2018...updated review. This game is not good for seniors people.  I take care of seniors who have this game installed and they were unable to get past certain levels and ended up unistalling the game.  Too hard for seniors. Even though I passed certain levels, I m not getting an option to get help for 50 to 90 beans. I passed most of those levels with 3 stars, so why am I not getting any options for that? Its BS!' ,

      'Good I hope they fixed the bug where you double buy a car and it gives you the same car but still takes your money. But its still a great game. Ohh! And also raise thr chance if getting a legendary I played for almost a year and I never got one l. My friend got one all the time on his apple but there Is a glitch with android.ive never had one.',
       'Good, but has some bugs I\'m sorry if I\'m being too critical in this review but especially on Mobile Data, Smashy Road can lag. This is to the extent the game will no longer work. Moving on to a positive, the graphical interface is very nice, the perspective, movement and background vehicles is very well created.  Very good game overall',
       'It\'s good but... I enjoy playing this game, there isn\'t too much skill involved but it\'s a good way to kill time and it stays easy enough to make it enjoyable while raising the difficulty.  The only thing I want to see is no more of this, automatically backing up stuff. When you are nose first in an object, the game automatically backs you up, but I\'ve lost countless games because it doesn\'t stop or doesn\'t back up enough. Let me choose when to back up!',
       'Good but... you can sometimes glich and get trapped but it\'s a good game anyway like you run from police. Also when you start off you have to press right or left to start so you can\'t go straight forward when you get on. I really liked it though it is one of my favourite games! I\'m out  Later ima go play some Smashy Road now!',
       'Shalom there, The game is awesome. I liked it very much and hoping that in the future they will be more cars to be added. I really hope that "military helicopter" can shoot something, it is funny...so idle. Last thing, a HOVERCRAFT can go "river mode" ! Wrecked... because of...water. Hope you\'ll add the " police boats " in next update. Overall, abundant of thanks and good luck.',
       'I LOVE THIS GAME. It just need\'s some work to do. Like, you guys need to fix the glitch of the lines by the road. And you need to fix when we explode the oil truck and fall on the ground and you disapear. And can u guys please add some new prizes like to change the color of ur car. And when I have 100 dollars u can spend it on colors  theirs a button to choose what prize you want. Like say I get the color blue for a red car. And I like the red car so I go to the prize machins and choose to buy a color than I have the button to change the color of ur car. That will make the game a lot better. And I\'m sure when u do it there will be more downloads.' ,

       'Good but buggy Good but buggy, one can earn infinite money in no time then u can upgrade ur vehicle to the max in the very first level. That destroys the fun of the game. Second if u have money in millions, the cost of the parts are also in million and so on, and even having millions of dollars in the game u might fail to upgrade vehicle sometimes  that makes no sense.',
       'I really like this game and its one that I can play continuously, my only problem is that I can only play once a day.. the game will work for as long as I play but as soon as I exit I can\'t back on until the following day. It sucks because I have to complete as much of the game as possible in a certain amount of time and that kills the fun. I can\'t just enjoy it and play a bit then carry on playing a bit later.. please fix this I really enjoy.this game and its getting ruined a bit for me...',
       'I like this game but i faced a problem. When i tried to make a purchase of INR 89.99 for this game,  balance has deducted but no coins or other benefits added in my account.  What is that?  When i searched on google for any helping contact email id or website, there is no email for help.  So tell me,  what should I do? Either solve my problem or i am going to file a case against you. Contact me as soon as possible.',
       'Yesss. I complete this game in 7 days. I can\'t understand the ending why that cantenar shake. It\'s mean the zombie are in the cantenar? It\'s mean part 3 will exist? Awesome game. I feel happy and relef when I complete the game and go on that ship. I think there will be a helicopter because in start there is a helicopter. But nevermind awesome game. Make part 3. Bye..... And I read there is hidden kits? What is this. Why I don\'t read it before. I can\'t find any kit. But what is kit? Nevermind I completed the game. One more time. Awesome game. Bye.....',
       'My problem with the gane comes from some sort of bug that started like an ad mid-run, then it started doing some weird rainbow pattern that flipped 90 degrees every few seconds.

      'I wish I could give this game 10 stars. It\'s amazing all around.  It\'s adorable and fun. The graphics are amazing too without any glitches so far. Haven\'t noticed any bugs either. The developer\'s done amazing. It does get repetitive after a while but so far by the time it happens something new unlocks so it\'s still fun. Can\'t wait to see what else you guys do to improve the game play since everything else has been flawless so far. Great job, keep up the great work!',
       'This game is super cute! I love my lil ninja friend! Lol. Nice story, and plenty to do to keep you busy. Will def take time to master, but it def has the potential to keep you interested in playing. Even got my wife playing it, and she usually only keeps games for a day or 2, cuz she gets bored with them. I think she\'ll play this one a little longer than most of the other games she\'s tried. I\'m really happy i found this game!!',
       'This one is probably my favourite, with minecraft and clash of clans. If you don\'t have this Virtual Friend game, then it is you who is missing out. Install and enjoy. There\'s nothing bad about this game, and if Naturalmotion do want me to suggest an add-on, then maybe enable me to link the game with a new device. I was LVL 52 once but I lost it. Now I\'m level 17. Hope you liked the suggestion. :)',
       'I love this game, it\'s simple and sweet. However, there was a middle row in the item-picking menu in which I had invested many coins into to help me level up faster. Today, when I logged in, the row simply disappeared without a trace. I tried restarting my phone and clearing the backgrounding of my app, but nothing seemed to fix it. Now I only have the Training row and the Fun stuff row. It took me quite a while to get those coins and I\'d really appreciate it if you brought the row back or gave me a solution to get it back. If it helps, you should also know that the \'I\' on every icon which used to let you see how an item was used has also vanished. Please fix this, thank you.',
       'You should add a dog and a cat wearing ninja suit they can be like the chicken and the squirrel the dog can run around you and bark and find bones and sell them for coins and the cat can find fish and sell it for coins. It just sounds like a good idea  the dog should be a husky or a smaller dog like a beagle so it is small like the other animals and it can sleep with the ninja the cat can just be a cat please look into this *^* looking forward to this',
       'This is a great game that I\'ve played off and on over the years. I just redownloaded it, and it\'d still fun to play. My only gripe is that there\'s no place to save your progress. Cloud, Facebook, etc. I hate having to start from level 1 every time I have to wipe/switch phones. Even an account that saves your data would be great. Fix this and it\'ll be 5 stars all the way for me.' ,

      'Nice n interesting  game but lots and lots of cheating for example. When I come first and the other cars are behind me they take a shortcut  or hit my car and I suddenly come fifth...otherwise the game is nice to drive the car on water which  I have never seen so I\'m  giving it 2 stars',
       'Alex you have to make the water slide bigger because my car doesn\'t have enough space and people keep on passing me. And you have to make a section where you can upgrade your car because people keep on passing me because my car is not fast enough and their car is  FASTER THAN ME.',
       '(REAL REVIEW) It\'s quite a short game with only 13 water slides but fun & challenging. You have to be a good driver to win as it\'s a sim arcade game. There isn\'t many cars to unlock and no track editor but other than that, not a bad game at all',
       'It sucks and it is super glitchy i do not recommend to anyone as it can let the other players win i am a pro player at games and i know what i am doing it is just a time waster played it for more than afour months and hoping to have some updates , by the way there are no more updates this game is fully developed .',
       'Why is it when it\'s time to race the other cars get a a head start and it randomly stops your whilst racing the game is bulshit',
       'Level 13 is not resolve even you are 1st 3 times or more. Bridges are breaked in all levels.  Nice try but not successfully done' ,

      'Ok I get it but why do the army kill you for no reason? I like this game because you can do roleplay and I\'m a girl and there is girl skins which is amazing but can you start with a girl skin and a boy skin to be fair with the girls  Pls do these. Love your company :-) but can you add a roleplay mode that would be great DO MORE:-) but now on my new tablet it won\'t let me play it please fix that and reply',
       'Good. However, the apple versioned platform overwhelms us by many advantages: They can earn coins and cash quicker n easier. They get options on what currency they use to purchase things. They get to higher leagues easier. Their weapon description overpasses ours as ours literally gives us damage and capacity whereas theirs comes with fire rate, trait etc.',
       'I love this game but I have a couple of requests 1st. Could you add u YouTuber skin back like boy,girl,animal then YouTuber 2nd. Could you add a button that you can press that alows you to make your own custom paint job for any vehicle that would be amazing 3rd. Can you make and road that ends come back into the city at the other side example the road behind the hospital 4th. Could add like 5 houses around the city that you can go into 5th. More vehicles   If you agree with what I have sead in this comment like so the developer can see!',
       'I love this game. But for the next update, u should give each skin there own special ability. Like the flash and hulk skins. Give the flash super speed, give hulk super strength and etc. So that everyone can get a different type of advantage. Plz make this happen next update also make a goku skin. So u can turn super saiyan. And have other transformation. So can u plz have every skin to have different abilities that match the skin',
       'I have been playing the game for 6 or 5 years and it has been the best game i have played. So, i  think you have to make this game better in the next update.Here r my suggestions 1 make the graphics better. 2 day and night shift. 3police attacks bandit in adventure mode.4 add a clan.  I hope u will add these in the next update.Also too many players that hacked their health so plz fix it.Thx',
       'This Game Is Awesome Ilove It Somuch I could Play it With My friends Keep It Up I think That You Should Add some New Weapons Like Lightsaber And You Should Make The People Drive Cars .Why  Peoples Does Not Drive Car?. Well But thats not good make the people drive thanks Keep It Up.' ,

      'It\'s alright.. But I expected the ads to stop once I made a purchase.. They did not stop. There are quite alot of ads.. Pretty much an ad every time you finish a round. Uninstalled due to ads. I still like stickman dismounting by viper games better. I just wish they\'d come out with new levels, etc. more frequently',
       'Fun to play for maybe 20 minutes, very little motivation to continue playing. Game will become boring before the 15000 points for the first unlockable item is reached. This gets the lowest possible rating because the goal is to make you purchase points. I\'d rather just pay for the game and play through, with some gratification every few attempts.',
       'I would say the game money you would need to unlock next level is pretty high! I am dead sure you won\'t be able to make to next level without purchasing the game money. This is not cool guys! No body likes playing the same level again and again!',
       'I broke the game. Scored over 6 million points on one map. Other than accidentally breaking the game it\'s stupid fun. It will make your phone very hot though.',
       'Its just one of many ripoffs of "Stickman dismounting" by Viper games. Same exact concept as the game that came out way before these stupid ripoffs. Even the description is a slightly modified version of Vipers. If you want the real experience go download Viper games version.',
       'The game is stupud, you just try and hurt yourself? You can get any level or vehicle but the ammounts to purchase them are unattainable unless you pay out of pocket and the game isnt even fun enough to want to do that. Save yourself the trouble do not DL' ,

      'Amazing game love it easy to level up and I\'m suprised prehistoric animals can be so business worthy. The Graphics could improve a bit. The main problem I have is that it takes ages to load at the start. One time I timed it and it gone up to 26.56 minutes. I would have only got this game from my jurrasic park and world Dan Cameron.  Or you might know him as Shark blue.  I would hugely appreciate it if Ludia Inc. Could respond to my feedback for an improvement or just application.',
       'The game is fun, especially if you like tycoon type games. The issue is there are too many types of currency that really require purchasing. Difficult to progress without shelling out a lot of cash.  Edit: After spending a few more hours with the game I\'m actually very happy with the game, just takes a little to get over the hump to where things take off.',
       'Best dinosaur game out there. My top 3 favorites are the T-rex, velociraptor, & Prognathodon. Theyre so beautiful. I also like the new update - the Photo mode. Thjs game has also the best graphics. Although, some of the dinosaurs or their details or the backgrounds are not so realistic compared to others also in this game(ex. The thorns of the tyranotitan, etc.). Looking forward for better improvements. Nonetheless, thisgame is great. I appreciate it a lot. Thank you for reviving my childhood love. &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3  Also, I hope you make other dinosajr games like Dinosaurs Sims, or kinda Dinosaur tekken. Well, thats a bunch of memory on my phone and a lot of your hardwork. :D :D :D',
       'This game is a non stop grind for well over a year in order to have anything interesting happen. Otherwise it forced microtransactions down your throat just to get 1 half decent dinosaur you can use for a short time before it becomes irrelevant. For the money your gonna spend on this game to enjoy it just buy yourself an actual console and a AAA game',
       'Graphics are good and the game is addictive. Major money grab though. Always trying to get you to spend.  Character design of the animals are just variations of the same skin (Allosaurus has 2 fingers when they really had 3, same for various other species). Presents fun facts that also aren\'t always correct (Pteranodons were not called Pterodactyls).',
       'I have to login everytime i open, also sometime it says already have permission from fb but then deny login. Chache are deleted as my device keep on cleaning so app download 600 mb of data everyday. Takes a lot tym in whatever it process. Need performance update and these bug fixes for smooth experience than i can rate better' ,

Each believe that their way of life is the only way, and are dedicated to teaching their polices to all other nations through what there leaders claim as divine intervention, or as you will know it... war. <br><br>The others are known as: &quot;Archidons&quot; the way of the archer, &quot;Swordwrath&quot; the way of the sword, &quot;Magikill&quot; the way of the mage, and &quot;Speartons&quot; the way of the Spear. <br><br>You are the leader of the nation called &quot;Order&quot;, your way is of peace and knowledge, your people do not worship their weapons as gods. This makes you a mark for infiltration by the surrounding nations. Your only chance to defend is to attack first, and obtain the technology&apos;s from each nation along the way.',

      'The movement and the ability to delete structures for refund could be better. Trading HQ could be so much better, my main concern are the loading screens. Perhaps instead of loading the whole city a separate map viewer could be opened that shows general statistics and layout but not the entire city. That way trading could be done faster between cities and there would be more involvement with the trading community. As it stands its a real chore and is deterring me from trading as much as I\'d like. Another idea is if the stock market could be integrated somehow. I think that would be cool, and it would add an element of realism.',
       'The more stuff is added the lagier it gets. Game freezes when buying items, when going over your city, with the chat, loading the flobsl trade, travelling to other cities and basicly everything nowadays. Requires multiple restarts of the game and reboots of my phone regularly to keep jt playable nowadays. It used to be really good and smooth, but it only gets worse each update and no improvement in sight. I only play now because I made some good friends in my club, but the actual fun is long gone. :(',
       'This is a great game,very addicting, but can you please fix the glitch that makes everything either too big or too small. The contest of mayors screen doesnt even show up  only shows up one third. Will rate higher once this is fixed, its very annoying',
       'Game is basic in its features. The worst part of the game is the trade hq. Rather than letting you buy directly off the hq menue you have to load the other players city. If your phone doesnt load it as fast as someone else they can snipe the goods you need to buy.',
       'Great game!!! Would love coins for basic production items but they are not necessary for this game to be great. Also maybe if there were rewards for club donations back and forth more lol would do it. Thanks for providing really great entertainment :)',
       'Lots of potential! A EA omega blog headquarters building for idears would be good. bring back the cinema, city with no cinema! Simcity needs a expansion. Don\'t like the desaster battle concept, it should of been a stock exchange battle concept. and had a better approach to the desasters.like Desasters emergency service building with weekly events for random desaster repairs for existing and new realistic scenarios. Get rid of vu building and desaster island and replace it with emergency desaster service building and a weather towers. Then instead of having to event there would be 3 online events.' ,

      'Love the concept, but it doesn\'t work at ALL. I downloaded it, and no matter what I do, nor how absolutely silent it is, the chicken is running and jumping and I have zero control over it. Super disappointed--hopefully it\'s just glitching?? I wanted to try it, but neither sound nor silence give me any control over it üò£',
       'People complain about the ads but 2 dollars is all you need to remove them. Cheap and it supports this fun game. If your game audio is interrupting the jumping then plug in some ear buds, it\'s that easy people!',
       'It\'s a great game, hilarious concept, only thing I have issues with is that the noises for picking up the coins pick up as sound. Frustrating when you are trying to be careful and it dings and sends the chicken into a mine... Maybe make them doubtless so they don\'t get picked up by mic.',
       'Good game but enough with the ads. Way too many and way too long. The ads are longer than the game play. Ine ad was over 30 seconds long. You guys obviously do not read these comments or reply to any of them. This could be a great game.',
       'Way too many adds. The adds block the sensitivity, so I cant adjust that, so I have to scream as hard I can for a jump. Then a 30 sec minimum add almost every retry. No thanks. Could be entertaining though',
       'This is the most funny game ever MUST DOWNLOAD IT Awesome Graphics You Scream To Make It Jump Amazing Controls And Levels You Must Download It!!? Actually it makes you laugh so funny Hilarious üòÇüòÇüòçüòç' ,

      'I have to say I\'m disappointed that I can not collect when I\'m gone. And the fact that the damage is really strange. So my guy does only 10 damage then when I got the sheep he did 303 damage then the bat did 600 then it went up to 11k when I got the chicken. It is pointless to upgrade my guy if the chicken does 11k damage and the fact that I can\'t collect when I\'m inactive is a bit frustrating. It\'s called idle miner and yet you have to have the game active to get gold and resources if the chicken can do 11k and level 1 and I ONLY do 63 as a level 20',
       'Great game my only gripe is the cost versus value of iap after starter pack. Great deal for the 2.99 then next offer is 11.99 and only worth 3.99 at best. The items offered at the 11.99 pack are so not worth anywhere near that price.',
       'Worst idle game I\'ve played. Most idle games keeps on collecting recourses while your away, on this one you have to keep the game active.',
       'It\'s really fun it\'s just that sometimes it just takes so long to break the blocks. I like it how there is boosters and companions but I also like that they make good changes so I got to give this a four-star!',

      'I mean it\'s obvious that this is fake. I especially like that it tells you to keep in mind that true love cannot be calculated instead of saying it gives real results. It\'s literally impossible for an app, or anyone/ anything to determine soulmates based on names. However I gave this game 3 stars because it caught my attention unlike some games do, also I like that you don\'t have to do a quiz or put pictures or describe personalities for a fake answer.   don\'t get your hopes up but definitely check it out',
       'I like this game because i know. Its fake but my crush and all my friends crushes got 100 and i know its fake but im not a faake and so sometimes tall are fakes everyone is nut sure you can  have a crush aand sometimes you  are crushing  on somone and you kknow games im not talking to one person im talking to a lot but if you don\'t  have any faith in  yourself  and i really  have  faith  in myself and know what it feels like but this game mmakes people have faith and believe that it it really means something so whoever put two stars or lower think again because i did and i got what i wanted.üòôüòçüòöüòóüòôüòòüòöüòòüòôüòóüòöüòòüòôüòóüòöüòóüòôüòóüòòüòöüòçüòôüòóüòçüòôüòúüòúüòú‚ù§üíò‚ù§üíò‚ù§üíòüíìüíõüíúüíîüíùüíïüíìüíüüíñüíü‚ù£üíñüíåüíå‚ù£üíóüíóüíñüíùüíïüíîüíìüíì',

      'This game is great but it could be so much better.   1. The expert AI is too easy to beat. Risk players normally gang up on an opponent, if they are dominating. There should be a legendary option.  2. It would be nice to have a match summary and timeline at the end of a game.    3. There should be an auto-save game feature when playing against the AI, in case the game drops out.  Edit: They seem to have addressed my third point.',
       'The game was fun i paid for the full game, but after losing game after game because an army of 30 lost to an army of 4 or 5. Or it glitches and my whole army becomes the enemies, or someone turns into a computer and goes in an all out assult i get very frustrated. Risk is fun but so many glitches. Poorly run app with very little work given to it.',
       'This is a very frustrating game. Every single time I play my turn (in a multi-player game that is) I get disconnected! .. and I\'ve to replay it again .. only to get disconnected again! and so on and so on till my time runs out. Sometimes in the middle of all this \'replaying\' I even lose my troops to other players .. VERY FRUSTRATING! And No .. I\'ve both a very good data and wifi connections.',
       'Was fine for a couple weeks.... Then it started freezing up in the middle of my games.... All of them. I\'m using a LG V30+ with 128g ram so it\'s definitely not a lack of storage issue.   I wouldn\'t recommend this app to anyone who likes uninterrupted gameplay.',
       'Best board game there is. Would be nice to see some updates since the developer is making money. Maybe more colors of armies to pick from. Making it easier to play with people you have played against before. Maybe different theme music in the style of a jukebox. That is my biggest problem with paying for apps, is once they have your money they don\'t care.  I\'ve dropped money on the game a few different times and I don\'t mind as long as there is improvement on the game and a willingness to do so by designers. Which is something I haven\'t seen. I\'ve been playing this off and on since 2014 I believe.',
       'I joined to get the one free game per day. Be aware, that if you do not subscribe (like me), the dice are loaded...  I actually had an army of 9 or 10 roll over against an army of 1 on quite a few occasions... statistically highly improbable.' ,

      'Best curling game I\'ve seen Enjoy the graphics, controls, love the 1 on 1 against international players and career game options. Seems consistent and easy to learn. Needs a few tweaks like... throws that don\'t make hog line or touch hogline must be taken out of play. Have seen the bug that others reported, sometimes rock after thrown disappears , some kind of glitch that happens occasionally.  Sometimes the sweepers don\'t react to my movement to sweep. Would love to see 8 stones instead of 6. If you love curling, this should satisfy',
       'Great game except for hackers. There is a hack that allows some to bump or change finish of a throw. Yoy can go from having 2 scoring to opponent having the score, changing after the rocks stopped. Developers have not replied ti report. Fine for some fun but don\'t waste your money in upgrades',
       'Very fun game. Multiplayer is awsome! Please add private matches so i can play with friends.   Physics still need work to hold up to real world standard. Rocks dont follow thru on take outs in real life as they do in this game. Also (rules), a rock needs to make it all the way over the hogline in order to stay in play.  Thank you for making this game!',
       'Nice game Not true curling but closer then any game I have played so far and it\'s still fun.  There seems to be a glich where stones jump to a different position after the throw, but doesn\'t happen often.  There is no hog line violation and it\'s difficult to promote so most games end up being a culster f in the 4ft.  Once you realize it\'s a game and not real curling your addicted.',
       'Full of cheaters Started to play and it was awesome. But it seems that some people created cheats and make your pins move from their places without even theirs touching them so that they win points. I will not play it until its updated and try again. Too bad.',
       'Not bad for free. Minimal ads. The two drawbacks are that in career mode, the game is slanted in the opponents favour too much. And in 1 on 1, it takes forever to load an opponent. Fix that and I would give it a five star rating. Also, it would be nice to see the developer actually respond to some people\'s concerns.' ,

      'I like the game. You can do good if you put some thought into it. My only  complaint, is that I didn\'t make it to the next level at season end which is fine but why did I get reset at the minimum for that level and I check the standings and there are teams that already have enough points to make the next level?  I\'m 15-0 in my season and still 100 pts behind the leading team and not even in the top 1000.',

      'The mini golf is great! I\'ve had a ton of fun playing and you don\'t need the in app purchases to win as long as you\'re meticulous with your shots. The ads are a necessary evil I guess. My only big complaint is that lining up shots with the button controlls. They need to have some sort of sensitivity changer so that shots can be fine tuned. All in all though, great game! Good job.',
       'Worst challenges ever, setup terribly to make it harder to win, always end up in a corner or another bad angle. Ball speed is so touchy, the smallest amount makes it from "to slow" to "over shot", really needs to have better increments.. usually it takes a while for me to dislike a game but this one had me agrivated pretty quick.',

If I can determine that I wanna pass my high score who says I can\'t get better grades....... I love the game keep doing  what your doing and make more games..... To everyone  I advise you to play this game üíñüíû',
       'Very fun, I love it In this game you can choose your players, Tom or Angela. Then you can ride and you try to get as far as you can throughout the obstacles and challenges. You also try to collect stars along the way. However many stars you collect determines your score. This app will keep your scores and will let you know if you get a high score. When you run into something you have the option to keep going if you watch an advertisement. This app is not boring at all. It works great and doesn\'t take up much space.',
       'Oh please shut up. It is a very good game and a nice distraction for kids so stop saying it\'s not good enough.  If you are still so sure it sucks then try making your own game see how people reject it',
       'Amazing!!! It is so good good good that I can  play it every day! Well did you even make talking Tom gold run because  if It was your companies game it is great! Sorry that  I putted four stars because I didn\'t see that there were five stars so I accidentally putted four stars.' ,

After being forced to watch 30 sec to 1 min ads for a couple minutes of play I am again pressured to rate this game. So I do. My advice is to eliminate or greatly reduce video ads. Will give you much higher rating later if changed and uninstall at some point if you don\'t.',

       'Hello from Leslie, a.k.a., Ahma (Yvette & Isabel\'s Grandma)! I\'ve been playing a game called Bubble Cloud that is similar to this and is put out by Valas Media. And this game is just as fun (so far) as that other game is. But I let myself spend $40 last month Bubble Cloud! Ugh!!! All because I wasn\'t paying attention. I\'ve only spent 99cents thus far on Bubble Shooter Pop & that\'s it! And I haven\'t even begun to use it all up yet.   The only reason I didn\'t give you 5‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜs is because the aim on the laser,  well the controls over all, need some fine tuning. Otherwise you\'re good to go! I\'m so happy. I loved that other game & had to stop playing all together as I was too temped to spend more money. Not a good thing. NO game that is advertised as "FREE" should cost one so much money that one feels like they\'re gambling. And I did. Thanks for the new game opportunity, Leslie',

      'I downloaded this game and the very next morning my phone got hacked. I\'m not saying it was definitely related to the game softwares but I have no way of knowing, so I will not be installing this again. Also its clearly a straight theft of  Minecraft with only some textues and sounds changes. Blatant copy write theft.',
       'I love this game but you can\'t open chest or crafting table or stove. About the houses: it\'s really fun and easy to build the houses. And also it\'s one of the best and exiting Minecraft game ever!!! But like I said you can\'t open anythingüòë But other than that in love it can you please fix the changes that I want if you can please!! Thank you!!üòä',
       'I went all unsure but three stars.It was the best game I played but 21 days after I downloaded the game was broken! I went to my map and my dogs head became a leg!?.my brother had this game to and I played on is server.but then his body was broken!. Next thing he was invisible!.please fix the bugs on this game and I\'ll give you five stars.',
       'DO NOT WASTE YOUR DATA ON THIS PIECE OF TRASH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!impossible to see at night due  to ads. ever walk around outside after midnight with a flashlight in your hand pointed at your face? well the ads make it hard as hell to see at night. i have started this game six times and cannot see anything happenning at night. and that is too big of a flaw for me tocontinue to use a game. paid 7 bucks and downloading the real minecraft right now. DO NOT WASTE YOUR TIME!!!!!!',
       'At first the game was great but then there were a few things that need to be added. First of all, you can\'t crouch, second of all,it doesn\'t have texture packs, and make the graphics like the real version of momentary. If you add these, I will give you 5 stars.',
       'OMG THIS GAME IS EPIC!!!!!!!!! I have 1 question, there are these holes in the ground  (in creater mode) and the holes have iron and sapphires but I\'m scared 2 go in. What are they and is it 100% safe 2 go in the tunnels? At the moment, I just block them up. Plz tell me! Oh and I LOVE the fact that the game saves on its own!!!!!' ,

      'The sound effects barely play, there\'s no mucic, and the adds rarely complete enough to give any boosters.  The controls are pretty smooth and the graphics look good for a mobile game, but I\'m running this on a Note 4 and it\'s barely playable.  Please fix your stuff if you care enough about your customers to keep them playing your game.',
       'I used to love the old version a while later deleted it and haven\'t played this game for a few years now i\'m back and i t is totally different the races are pretty much the same but everything else is diffrent. Could you guys make a version just like the old one and call it angrybirds go orignal or something just please bring back the original',
       'Do not download this game unless you want it to do random brief stopd while you are playing and sometimes even taking you out of the game! I had downloaded this game for my four year old cousin and he got so frustrated he almost broke my phone! So if the makers of this game could fix this that would be gr8.',
       'Size is big issue in many rovio games. I think that makes it slow sometimes. Please reduce your apk size and optimize game for better performance. Thank you. You really have some new ideS n ilike your concept but need more quality in game size n performance thx',
       'It would be better if the videos worked. 99.9% of the time, it says they will aren\'t available. I can\'t get free toolboxes, extras stars on the daily races, boosts before games, fee gems, anything. And the game keeps crashing and taking my energy. All these AB games are glitchy.',
       'Its ridiculous, i downloaded it to play the game in my tv with chromecast. And it says my device is not supported. I am using Android Nougat and my brand new moto g5s+ and my new chromecast. Whats the use of this cast function in your app if no one can use it in their newest devices. Just remove that cast option from the game its useless' ,

      'This is a great game with good ideas. Don\'t listen to those people who say it\'s bad as its not. There are some flaws, mainly in the fact that there are only a few maps so more maps would be nice. Also, it would be nice if you could change the name or if there is a way, tell me. There are other slightly bad things but overall a great game.',
       'Great concept the only thing wrong with it is the slow movement\'s that happens some Times during the game hope  that you all fix it. Another thing is the lack of stages there are only four to three stages and all of them are with ice add more and I guarantee your that your ratings is going to rise. Finally the option to change your name at the main screen and better control\'s than just jumping. Would love to play it once these issues are fixed and I don\'t mean to be harsh hope you all got my opinions',
       'This game is good awful DO NOT INSTALL. The graphics are the only decent thing in this game and they are ripped off of the real game. The controls rarely work. The ads are always in the way. The AI\'s are OP and there is no point in playing the game. Its a much better idea to just buy the real game on steam instead. 100x better',
       'The graphics are perfect for the style, but attacks should be more under your contract with weapons, and variation without. I also can\'t find the Bluetooth multiplayer hinted by the Bluetooth connection permissions. Is that a later feature? If so please add soon!',
       'I like this game but please the attack please make it more sence attacking only jumping why dont u make like in pc moves',

      'I used to play this game a long time ago with my brother. I thought since after all these years so many new updates have come, the game must feel different. But it\'s the same. I love the tune that plays as you play it. It\'s so nostalgic. My brother isn\'t anymore with me but playing this game makes me really very happy. It\'s just like I am back in those old days. Specially for me, as it has so many memories, this game is the absolute best.',
       'The game is really addictive. but repeated zombie birds are generated and diamonds are getting wasted. Please change that. One bird one time please. One bird should be at max 3 level not another set. It\'s wasting my internet to watch video to get diamonds for collecting birds',
       'I love this game cause it kills our time when were bored. Yep, we, my mom also is addicted to this game hahaha, shes always getting my phone and play this game whenever im sleeping. Love it, I recommend this game to everyoneüíñ you\'ll be definitely love this game. MobiGame you slaaaay hahaha',
       'I personally loved this game. First off,  u cant jump for high periods of time cause u to run into the bombs. Secondly, whats sup with these prices? Thats ridiculous. You cant level up with prices that high and u have to buy üíé gems and coins just to get a level up... But tum... Very great game overall.',
       'Too much bombs. Like i have 16 zombies and they put 7 bombs in a row! How am i supposed to win if i cant jump that high with all those bombs in the way.',
       'I have a problem with my account. My punk zombird was maxed out. Level 3. Then when I opened the game, my punk zombird was gone... I obtained that by waiting patiently and gathering 90 diamonds. I had to watch 3 15-30 sec long video for 2 diamonds each. After watching the 3 vids, I had to wait another 8 hours for it to be available again. It took me a month to obtain that bird and then all of a sudden it dissapears?! I obtained it again but I had to start all over again. I uninstalled this app because of that issue.' ,

      'It was undoubtedly one of a kind and perfect game at the time of it\'s release. Everything from balancing to controls and gameplay was perfect. Until.....until developers thought of this "awesome" idea of putting it on steam and allowing PC community to play it. The game that was originally designed for mobile users now overwhelmed with PC users. I mean how devs thought that\'s a good idea to compare PC to mobile??? PC players are right now literally annihilating every mobile gamer. We have no chance against them they\'re better in everything from controls to aiming shooting. Once beloved game now lays in ruins conquered by PC community.',
       'I would like to have the game on my phone that way i can spend money on the game instead of on tablet as it is more comfortable. The game costs over 3gb! My phone has that but with all the apps that come with the phone that you cannot remove. I have only over 1gb. Sorry wargaming the game costs too much data. Once that is fixed ill change rating given and review. I would play the game if it costed one gigabyte.',
       'This game is great in my opinion. Once you understand how everything works and the techniques while playing, winning becomes more common. My only little complaint is that since the last update i dont always recieve my 10 pieces of gold. Ill watch the 5 ads a day but only recieve 30 or 40 gold total. It would be nice if we got paid the 10 gold after every ad like how it used to be. Not everyone has the money or is willing to spend the money on gold. It would be great if this could get fixed. Thanks',
       'Before update it was easy to play on 100 to 150 ping. It was smooth. But after 4.6 ... It cant be smooth like before. It lags alot...and cant defend myself properly. Barely i cant shot someone with laggy gameplay because of ping. My normal ping is just b/w 100 to 180 ....and i cant get lesser than this. Plz do smthing. #wargaming',
       'They muted me for 20 days bcs some a hole reported me for small arguing. F%=k WG bunch of low life lazy pigs. Get life A holes. I cant believe some bunch of morons think to judge and they cant even have proper lifes. Disgusting.',
       'I love it, but maybe the destructions can look a little better how they used to be.  Other than that this game is awesome but i have other ideas of the game and even making other games like this one. Just need help because i don\'t know where to start.' ,

      'This so freaking awesome, a woo hoo maker! I kept mumbling awesome, awesome, when i passed a car. And this is first time i\'m very exited when i managed to finish a level, even after that, i repeat again till i can surpass it perfectly. Even i haven\'t sleep for 2 days, felt like an alien or zombie, etc. But this game cheers me up alot. Recommended ? Yes! Good job dev, just download it guys. Lu pasti hepi dah! Keren!',
       'Wow... as I was writing this review it suddenly all disappeared as it said unfortunately traffic rider has stopped. Wow.. nice. I cannot even open the game without freezing up my tablet. Real nice. And tbh I love this game! On my phone it works..... üò•üò£üòàüëπ',
       'One of the best motorcycle game to date, weather conditions are great, bikes are great and handling is great, but the bad ai on higher difficulty level a few times are ridiculous and messes up everything.  Sometimes a truck speeds up to 150km/h just to close off that small gap, where you could slip through, but next time all cars in all lane slow down at once, so you can\'t pass anywhere, even though there\'s nothing in front of them. This is really annoying, when every second counts and there\'s no way to pass them for 4-7 seconds. Apart from this the game is great. The keep changing weather conditions is great too.',
       'There are some idiot missions such as combo overheading. I would give this game 5 stars if not those missions.',
       'LMAO I CAN\'T SEE THE WHEEL ROTATING ON BIKES LIKE HD FROD TOMA AND OTHER VISIBLE FRONT TIRES, CAN YOU FIX THIS PLEASE COZ I REALLY LIKE THE GAME. THANKS',
       'Gave one star less because the missons lack mathematical accuracy There was this level to travel 8 kms in 130s and it was showing it an easy mission with a bike of top speed 172 kph üòÇ The graphics and gameplay are superb I like the game' ,

      'This game was actually better than I thought. I thought it was going to be one of those stupid games where it has a stupid amount of ads and stuff, but it was quite good. Unfortunately I had to uninstall this game (I\'m sorry Train Depo!) Because it I already have loads of games. This is a good game and I also love the way that you get loads of money when you go to loads of stations at a park. The only thing is I managed to upgrade all of the stuff for the coaster and don\'t know what to do with it. Other than that, it\'s good',
       'This game is cool. You can beep the horn and do win shwild wipers and you can stop go and have fun',
       'Nice game it\'s one of the games like it\'s actually amazing features the graphics and I had a lot of fun when I play it',
       'This game is the most boring game ever all u do is just hold down the handle its so boring do not downlode and save ur storage',

      'Had found a phone on the job sight and played the sample version. I HAD to download it as soon as I got access to my own shine. I play constantly!  Haven\'t gotten very far yet. Thing I DON\'T like is you don\'t get an average..... IF you do, I\'ve yet to find where it is in the game. That\'s in NO way a deal breaker. So, GO DOWNLOAD IT!  See for yourself just how additive & F-U-N it is!!! üòâüíØ',
       'It\'s a  fun game but it\'s rigged. I think if you have a billion chips you shouldn\'t be able to play on lower lanes. I thought you were supposed to be matched up with people who are the same or close level. How is it I\'m bowling against someone who is level 171 and 8 billion chips and  I\'m level 43 .',
       'I have been playing for months and spent a fair bit of money on this app and also was enjoying playing until all of a sudden all the graphics went pink and now i cant play. Not happy!!! How do i fix it? Don\'t want to delete it really as i will loose all my chips and special balls. Someone help please !?!?',
       'Amazing.  It\'s just fun watching the bowling hall whizz by and get a strike.  I\'ve played and uninstalled this game, but the only reason for the uninstall part is storage.  For all of you who are new, try getting the ball between the front pin and either of the pins next to it, it usually gets strikes, but by strikes I mean doubles against level 7 Russians.',
       'I enjoyed this game for over a month and though I\'ve written to miniclip about the issues of a pink blanked out bowling ball and lane, they have not responded.  Ridiculously so, I used to play this game for a couple hours almost every day. I can\'t believe a game so fun that I would play with my friend and family became such a waste.  Fix the problems please!',
       'The game is very fun and adictive, the only problem is the last update. When I enter an online match, everything turns purple (the track, ball and animations), it looks like it didnt load. Im using htc m8s , android version 6.0.1. Thank you for the fix :)' ,

      'I was very surprised  at the diversity of things you can do. And you can speed up EVERYTHING MANUALLY. Ads are optional with selective rewards of either money or one of the three materials you use to build stuff with. The exclusive currency can be bought with irl money or exchanged for materials or in-game cash. Not like any tap game I\'ve ever played, I\'m very impressed! This is a keeper!',
       'This is the best tap games out there. It really loves up to its word saying to timers, unlike SimCity and just about every other game out there. Its easy to play and advance so it sets a wide age range. I would like to personally thank the devs for coming out with this game, something a was looking for for a while. 10/10. Keep up the good work!',
       'Absolutely excellent! I love the freedom of building whatever you like within reason. One thing that could improve it, and it might just be me thinking this, is that the buildings look different as you level them up. I do know that they look different at level 5, but at other levels it would be great, so you remember what level a building is. The idea that each building looks different, regardless of the type of building is still awesome, because it adds a slight feeling of difference and uniqueness. For example, I have come across at least 3 types of apartment and office, so my city/town doesn\'t all look the same. Keep up the good work! üëç',
       'I adore this game, it\'s such a time waster (in a good way)! I wish that the camera controls were compatible with wireless mice. only reason being is because I broke my screen and I can\'t use too much touch screen. :( apart fro',
       'Absolutely love this game, its customisable and you make your city however you want to. One thing I eould like to see is alternative buildings, like instead of a power plant, a hydro plant. Also plz add buildings that can go in the ocean like bridges. Overall love it',
       'It is true that there is no timer but instead your energy runs out very fast! At the end it takes too much time to build a real city!  Also has nothing innovative comparing to other games.' ,

      'I\'m not trying to be a hard ass, but I take issue when games like yours automatically goes into a tutorial mode instead of offering it as a choice. It drives me crazy. If your game gave the user the choice of either to use the tutorial or not my ratings would be between 4 & 5 stars.',
       'Plays fair - at least, so far. By that I mean some games like this stack the deck against you. This one seems to realize that if I lose too many times I am likely to uninstall it. No ad income when that happens.',

      'Certainly has some potential if developed a bit more.Only played 1st 2 missions which were over in less than 30 secs considering Its only a small game. The AI is not good nor control system that great. Still be nice to see what looks like improvements after a few updateds. Keeping a lazy eye on this:-)',
       'I can see through the map in several places and the Enemy and the map itself is very Glitchy.   There is an Extremely annoying rooster crowing throughout the entire gameplay and yeah I could just mute it but why? I shouldn\'t have too!!   Then you can hear when an Enemy sneaks up behind you.  I had an alright time playing it but it\'s Definitely Not a game you\'d wanna spend money on, at least not THIS Version anyway!!',
       'Overall....Great Game, but with Controls of Shooting & Moving around....It\'s Not Exactly Easy to Around. And when it comes to Movement just in General....my Main Problem, But NOT the Only Problem was the Movement in Exactness of where I\'m Trying to Move my Guy (My/the Shooter) just Stinks!! - The Game itself....I Love It!!!',
       'Good game and all but the pictures shown for the view isn\'t what it seems, and this game has some flaws, such as inaccurate hitmarkers. When an enemy shoots from behind me, for some reason, it points to the front, I almost died one time, pressed medkits, I got back up, and I couldn\'t turn the camera for the rest of the game. Also, add the guns that are actually in the pictures... :/',
       'Way way way to many ads. If you want to exit, you cant because an ad keeps popping up. After every mission or round an ad pops up. When you want to change a setting, an ad pops up. Could ne great, instead its the definition of a sellout',
       'Great game.... but difficult for controle on himeself during shooting  you can get killed during shooting by enemies if you will not move to and fro...' ,

      'This is HORRIBLE because it is so hard to get the middle piece of hair!!!    I just wasted my whole morning playing this game. Its kind of fun, but really frustrading. I don\'t know if I spelled it right but you should not download it.',
       'I downloaded this game and tested it. The controls are terrible, I can\'t even pick up the scissors. Parts of the hair I found out that you could not cut it. I don\'t have a clue why they made this game when it is this horrible. I don\'t recommend this game at all. My rating will say 1 star because there isn\'t a 0 star option. My true rating is 0 star.',
       ',okay it\'s just that when I play the game in like when I cut the hair and stuff and messes up on me like that!! It would be great if y\'all will fix the game and make it like more realistic and more funner and make the controls work better cuz I\'ll be awesome',
       'It was hard to use in general and the graphics a bad. I wish it was more realistic. You don\'t even really get to choose where you cut.',
       'Oh my God this thing is so awesome and I love doing hair so this is so great for me message love it like I love doing hair. I don\'t know why is that it\'s to me like I love her hair like I just like doing here I mean it\'s pretty fun and I and I like getting cuz you\'re here but and then I don\'t like games that like tell you what they do what you can just turn it and everything yeah',
       'The worst game ever! When I tried to touch the scissor\'s several times it wouldn\'t work! I RECOMMEND YOU TO NEVER DOWNLOAD THIS APP BEACAUSE IT\'S A WASTE OF TIME!!!!' ,

Without this problem the game is so nice and the gameplay,  grafics, controls evrything is too good. Everyone should download it if they can tolerate ads.',
       'It\'s funny that u cannot play offline because u are reqiured to watch ads everytime u complete a mission or fail couple times. Reduce the amount of ads and i will download this game again. No one wanna finish a mission in 30 seconds and watch ads for the same time. Ridiculous',
       'So much ads !!!! And it sticks to only one level only worst game the game always crashes and it stucks to a particular lvl only we always have to play it online  it\'s not offline !!! Worst game ever!!! Pls don\'t download wastage of your storage and internet data!!!',
       'You need to put a checkpoint everytime the player loses the ball so they wont start over again. And please do not put too much ads on the game it\'s just making it worse. Make it an offline game why because you are just making it an online game to put ads on it. This sucks.',
       'Internet problem The game is good but it suddenly ask for internet connection to continue its. Very bad fix it and pls reply to me',
       'Nice game but hell lot of ads i can\'t play it consistently as i get interrupted by ads frequently and is so annoying that even though i like the game, i only give 1 star rating! Please reduce the ads and don\'t be very greedy developers' ,

      'Such a bad game. Nekki never gets enough of money so they show ads nearly after every fight. You can\'t earn gems from watching videos as it\'s never available. Tapjoy offers have been completed, but never awarded. All the weapons gets worser as you level up. Nekki wants you to BUY the good weapons. Bad game. Shadow fight 3 is worser than this one.',
       'Challenges ruin the experience. Mandatory in order to progress and level up. Some challenges are just ridiculous, and frustrating when you\'re given five tries and having to watch a thirty second ad to get one back every time, even if you make a simple mistake. Other than that it\'s good.',
       'The AI spam SO much! All they do is throw a suriken at you till you die. They won\'t even let you get up! 2 hits and I die yet I hit them like 10 times! There should be unlimited energy who wants to spend $20 for unlimited energy. Plus the controls are trash.',
       'Let me just say I don\'t mind a challenge. But the first boss fight is ridicoulous. You need to be lvl 7 to do anything. I would not have a problem with that but you have to farm survival mode to get lvl 7. No problem right well no there is a problem you get 2 xp for beating survival 2!!!!! And you need 400 this is freaking ridicoulous. Plus when you get lvl 7 he is like a regular oppenent. The difference between 1 lvl should not be this high',
       'As much as I like this game, the final boss is unnecessarily difficult. Seriously, what were you thinking when you came up with it? And the game crashes more than I\'d like. But the game is really well done! Flaws and all, it worked out well. Nicely done.',
       'It\'s a great game, I must admit. But why are you so slow in adding newer features to the game?  There\'s only one enchantment - Tempest rage in the mythical recipe, which was added about 6-7 updates ago. What about the other three?  Also there is only charge as powers in clan raid, NO ELIXIR, NO HORN, some other icons in the player\'s about section - ALL SAY - "UNDER DEVELOPMENT"! Don\'t you think you should be adding them asap!' ,
    recentChanges: 
      '- Sales and Festive Chest for the St. Valentine\'s and Chinese New Year!',
       '- Additional raid rewards - coins for buying the chest!',
       '- New clan rating calculation rules - personal clan rating doesn\'t "follow" if you move to another (new or old) clan.',
       '- Raid chat rules - no more abusive words and insults. Terms of use for raid chats. Ban in raid chats for breaking the rules.',

      'I love playing the game but there are so many updates all the time. And when they do their bimonthly update you have to download new package and then some gameplay features dont work. I have had a couple things not work from last update. I tried to contact support and they havent replied at all. Its been three days now. Im an everyday player who spends real money in game. Would rate higher if someone would help me out..',
       'The features of the game are cool.. i like all the pvp dungeons.. but most of the dungeons with event goes in certain time and limited.. if i miss them..then i hardly get the purpose of installing this game meaning.. nothing else to do.. it\'s getting boring for player like me who wants to spend hours online but no more rewarding pvp dungeons available overnight.. maybe create some entertaining 24 hours pvp features? I can tell many players tend to be inactive for more than 1 day...so hope for more crowded and better LOD..',
       'I just realized this evening that this game uses the microphone feature to spy on the players and listen to their conversations without their consent. After joining one event I could clearly hear conversations of other players (not about game and I\'m sure without them even knowing that they were being listened to) while I was having my sound turned off, even after leaving that particular event and when having my game in the background the sounds didn\'t stop until I turned off the game. This game should be called Legacy of Spies, nice try üëçüèª',
       'Spent almost two months time in this game but end up their glitch after an update resulted certain claim item forfeit. Maybe I was an f2p hence not worth their time and effort to assist me. Game deleted.',
       'Sorry for giving you low rating. But it\'s been days or weeks idk, it\'s always freezing when I try to open assassins chronicle and soul relic. And it\'s been months I\'m getting messages \'go get your mine\', but no map\'s coming. I can\'t even enter any plunder, for days. Hope you fix that.',
       'I could not even enter the game. every time I\'d push start it would say connection was unstable and lost. I have installed and uninstalled many times. and every sever showed as being in a stasis of red. Very disappointed in this app' ,

      'I have only had the game a few hours and I am already falling in love with it. It is great to go on when you have a spare 10-15 minutes. The grid is larger than others so I can read the words fluently and quickly without them being hard to see. You get points after each time you complete the grid so if you are really stuck you can receive a hint for some points. I would highly recommend this excellent game.',
       'Only been playing for a few days now, and so far, I love it! Forgot how fun Word Search puzzles can be, and to have it on my phone is priceless lol.. No complaints with the app so far. I will say though, maybe they should tweak it just a tad, instead of giving a hint only after a short moment, possibly creating \'the option\' to have a hint may be a little better. Not a big deal to me. It truly is a great app, love the simplicity of the graphic design too. Glad I came across this game.',
       'I enjoy ALMOST the whole game, being a word find and all, simple, yet deceptively hard at times. Still, I wish there was a way to turn off the \'hints\' it gives, as they get annoying... unless there IS a way that I haven\'t discovered yet...otherwise, I REALLY like the game, and would suggest it to all ages, as it\'s not too tough for the young ones, but still challenging enough for experienced players.',
       'It\'s a good game but there needs to be a way to turn off hints. If you don\'t find a word in the time it thinks you should, it keeps giving hints which ruins the gameplay. I pause for various reasons like talking to someone, cat catching a mouse, watching tv at the time, etc.. Or sometimes it might take longer to fins a word than seconds allowed before the hint.',
       'I love this game. Really nice and well thought out game. It\'s educative too. But I have just one issue with it though: The flashing hint. This gets me distracted each time it flashes. Maybe there could be a hint button at the bottom of the puzzle. That way instead of it flashing and getting us distracted, we could just click on it whenever we need help. Apart from that, it\'s just perfect. Will give it a 5 when the flashing hint is worked onüòÅ',
       'Other reviews are accurate  for me.. hints become irritating in that they only flash on for a second and you miss them rather than find them useful.  They also appear too soon so you have little time to search.  I also found the occasional issue registering a word and having to go over it several times. But it\'s a free game, it\'s fun, it\'s addictive what else is there to say ? It\'s good.' ,

      'Your game is cool and addictive. Just what i was looking for. Nice graphics,decent gameplay,fun racing and awesome rewards. It\'s my favourite game, i play it everyday. But only one problem, everytime it asks to download additional files. I had already downloaded it but still i recive this pop up message. Is this game online ?? If it is then please make it offline..plzzzzz.',
       'Its an overall addictive game but instructions wise it needs to be more giving. You dont really understand whats our task sometimes. Also i think there is a problem with the sensor or something. I mean i do swipe my finger across the screen but the car doesnt move. I have to literally do that twice or thrice sometimes. This makes me lose out. Its not really my phone as everything else works fine.',
       'The update has killed what was a great game. You now can\'t pass a level unless you get 3 stars. Meeting the objectives for 1 or 2 stars causes a glitch, where it tells you you\'re out of time, offers you the opportunity to buy more time (fuel?), or recommends you upgrade your car. The daily log-in prizes don\'t worry either. Please fix it, you broke something that was very enjoyable.',
       'It\'s a nice game to play, i always play with my son.  But do u hv new update on this game? Ive reached lvl100 and my cars were fully upgtaded few months ago.. and it start getting bored already if there\'re no new lvl',
       'The tracks have unnecessary curves that makes the whole game very disorienting when at high speeds. Also, the app seems to not sensing my finger and never switch tracks at the right time. Hope you can improve.',
       'I like this game, it\'s fun and my son loves watching me play! But it sucks that I have to be in the game in order for the gas to reload itself.. why can\'t it do it outside of the game? It kills my battery having to wait and it also makes my son want to play more and more not understand I need more "gas"' ,

      'I enjoy 2048 alot. I play it alot and I would consider myself pretty good, my high score is 250,000. When i was building on that high score, the screen glitched and swiped a number of times, ruining the order of the numbers. This has happened on multiple occasions only in this app. It\'s not such a big problem for people that are newer, but when you\'ve got big numbers, such as 8192, it makes the game unplayable.',
       'Awesome game I have basically mastered this game. Got a high score of 2,892,204. I made the highest tile which is 131,072. This game is amazing and requires intense focus. I lost focus for a second and a 4 appeared and I didn\'t notice. Messed me up when I was about to make the 65k tile',
       'best beain adict game. but 9 grid stage doesnt fulfill. not enough grid box. the Creator cheated. i m going to lodge a complaint against you. you ve to answer my brainüòÄ anyway superr game excellent',
       'When the game ends it\'s very abrupt - the board disappears to be covered by an ad and load music blares - very unpleasant. I hate the color scheme - this would be much funner if could choose - Caribbean blues, shades of green, Valentine reds and pinks...',
       'The game is great, but the leaderboards are seriously messed up.  The top high scores are literally orders of magnitude higher than it is physically possible to get.  I would assume that they have been "hacked" somehow to display these fake scores.  The developer should cap the high score at the number that is literally the highest possible score (based on the size of the board)',

      'Very spooooooooky Great this game is great but you should really try doing an update about the purple guy cause it makes no sense that in SL at the end some one stares at a mirror and purple eyes cone out and the purple guy is the only one in the game who is purple! I don\'t know if that makes sense plus the mini games don\'t match because purple guys death was I n fnaf 3 so who is that person in the mirror? I know I mite be Mike or William Afton William Afton is the purple guy but Mike would make more sense cause  the scooper',
       'I would have given it 5 stars But now since the update none of the Freddy\'s games work on my tablet. I am so glad it happened like this before I went out and bought the game like I had planned to do. I love thee games but now not one of them work on my ellipses 8 which they did at one time. Please fix this',
       'Its ok You should make us reach until the 3rd Night for more fun! :D The game is scary but uh..., you should really need to make FNAF 4! Good luck! Note: To complete the game, keep looking at cam. 9 and 11, if Toy Bonnie is gone, go to party rooms, if Toy Chica is gone, go to cam. 7, if Toy Freddy, dont worry! Make sure to check the vents!',
       'So scary. Good game. Look this game will scare you until you pee on yourself aka if your 11 and under like me should play if your not scared but,this game is good. I give it 5 stars no doubt. Lol but hurry up and come out with part 3 already plz!üòÄüòÄüòÄ F.Y.I always wind up the music box',
       'Best horror game in years! Can\'t  wait until I have enough money to buy the full version! Can you please add the random death mini games to the game. I don\'t know if they come with the full version or not... If it does not... I\'m getting the computer version. Please add them and I would like to play at least to two nights to play on the demo. If they did add two nights... I did not see that yet. -itoly256',
       'Advice to get u passed N1 in DEMO and real version 1. NEVER turn ur flashlight on in Cam 9. 2. Dont go crazy with ur flashlight battery 3. When u see Freddy wait 10 - 12 secs and THEN flick ur flashlight 4. Bonny and Chica don\'t do anything to u 5. Bonny goes to only 2 cams 6. Chika stays at the Main Hall 7. Freddy wont come out if u stay in Show Stage 8. If Freddy comes out and the music box needs winding do it quick *no rush tho 9. 6 A.M. will come soon 10. Night 5 will as well come soon' ,

      'This is the best TD game I\'ve ever played. Very fun but it does slow down a lot after 2 months of playing. Anyone who says you need to pay to win is a self entitled noob. I haven\'t spent a dime and I have the best heroes and reached the highest tournament level; you just need to be patient and enjoy the game.',
       'This is a very good game and well worth downloading if you like tower defense games. I\'ve played for a long time now, and there is no real reason to use money unless you are very impatient. The daily challenges give you good prizes and when you have risen in the ranks, you get additional prizes every day. They also add new content quite often.',
       'Nice TD! The campaign in enjoyable and there are lots of other minigames to play. The only issue to me seems to be the Tournament. There should be a limit of time. I\'ve seen crazy scores which makes it almost impossible when challenging other people. It would be nice to add more bosses levels and Easter eggs like in Kingdom Rush',
       'The game is really good but it\'s designed in the way which makes a "pay to win" or even "pay to play". After enjoying it for a while you realize the only way to continue enjoying it is either to win every tournament or spend more than a 100 dollars to unlock heroes and maps. The business plan of the game is insanely greedy...',
       'I\'ll give you a three star for the efforts that you\'ve put into this wonderful game. The graphics is superb, the story of heroes is interesting, the diverse towers, and many more but sadly the most wonderful strategy game I have ever played on mobile become a milking machine for profit. It was a really good strategy game with the contents of the first three world but when you opened up the 4th world the game became pay to win. Towers do minimum damage to the enemies so you have to rely on your heroes. Then the heroes become useless unless you fill them elixir which so to progress purchasing a new hero is prerequisite and that killed the game. Still thank you for all your effort it was a nice game indeed.',
       'This is a good game just cant get pass the 3rd map need atleast 6 hero.. daily login and challenge should give more gem for others who dont want to send money playing games.. been playing this for  a month now but still have 4 hero.. zzzzz' ,

      'I would like my 1.79 x2 money back. I clicked on some equipment and it said to upgrade. I brought the dimoans to up grade. To fine it upgrades to one star so you still can\'t make any extra recipes. I\'m now stuck where I can\'t move forwards with the firework order as I can\'t get the recipe. I had enough with this game as I feel as u get into it the more money you expect people to spend as you can\'t do stuff. I Spent about 20 pounds so far when u add it all up. No that not much to some people but there was no point. I wish I could ask for the money back. But I know this won\'t happen. I use to love this game. But I don\'t at the moment.it also nothing like the video you show',
       'Last night I still have 700+ diamonds, and this morning I only have 244 diamonds! What the hell happened to my 500+ diamonds. And I DIDN\'T SPEND IT last night üòí Can someone explain it to me?I\'ve been playing my cafe a year now, and I am very disappointed. It WAS my favorite game. I\'ve been saving diamonds, so I can buy special equipments. Fix this, and give me back my diamonds!üò§',
       'I wish there was no such thing as üí∞ in this game, everything is for free because I\'m struggling to upgrade coconut flakes to level 3. Also, there are some errors about this my caf√© update. There is no character named Comet when it says new character: Comet. And it says holiday ingredient fortune cookies, are there any fortune cookies no. Please fix this as soon as possible as my sister and I are feeling really angry because we want fortune cookies in this game. Apart from those errors that I not long said, I say that this game is good.',
       'Until recently, I would have given a 5 star review, but lately this game has been very frustrating. I keep getting this message that my profile has been changed, so I have to reload the game, and it erases some of my progress. This has even made it erase that I\'ve completed some orders for Diego, so I have to complete them over again, and restart my 2 hour wait. I\'m trying to save enough money to buy the pudding display case, but it\'s difficult when I suddenly lose $20,000-$50,000 at a time. Does anybody know how to contact tech support?',
       'Unfortunately I have to rate it 1 star from 5star. Previously this app was running smoothly in my device. But since the last update, everytime I am running it on my ASUS Zenfone 2 Laser, it is giving a message that unfortunately the app has stopped responding. I am really really hating this. During the special offer where Diego had visited, I can\'t even run the app properly. Moreover I can\'t complete the festival tasks. It is just causing too much problem. Hope you all will resolve this as soon as possible.',
       'I love this game! It\'s great for fast reflexs. It helps with social intelligence since you talk with yor customers and it gives you choices to start off the conversation! I also love the spice box and how you make special recipes! This couldn\'t get any better! 5/5 for me!' ,

      'Love this game.  Dev: you need to update and fix a few bugs. Check both inventory counts .. know the product count is off ... check the add/sub code.  I have maxed on level and would love to move on in this game. But if no update Soon will become bored and uninstall.  When will it be updated? üòê',
       'Game is horribly broken and makes playing challenging. The inventory can\'t add and subtract correctly and occasionally even tells me it\'s full even though I\'m trying to use what\'s in the inventory. For example was at 70, sold 10 mangoes so should be 60. Nope 66, try to harvest and nope your now full at 70. Adds up inventory and equals 48! Thanks a lot',
       'Kakamora pirates challenges SUCK! because there is no definite set of challenges to fill to win. You need 5 tokens. You get almost 5 days. I get the first 4 in 2 days. I spent the past 3 days filling challenges and getting random repeated "prizes"but never the top one. FRUSTRATING bc I like sooo many other parts to this game. But HATE to focus so much time and energy on a challenge for nothing üò†',
       'Please fix so we can save our progress either to Facebook or Google Play. Also, please fix the selling trader as items only go up to like 10 dollars.. please add more levels too!! I don\'t want to uninstall. This is actually a very good game and it is very creative. I absolutely love it.',
       'For 13 weeks I\'ve refused to play due to it royally freezing my phone to the point where I have to HARD reset it (had to Google how on my tablet) any time I try to open the game. It won\'t load past the 0.6 percent before it kills my phone. (S7 Edge) Used to be the only game I\'d actually play daily, but now it\'s just not worth it. Disney has obviously forsaken this game at this point in favor of the next, newest thing. Quite sad really as it had such potential.',
       'I have been playing this game for a long time. I have  invested time in expanding my island and now I\'m past level 40. But tonight  all of a sudden my entire Island has reset and I\'m back  to level 1. I can\'t figure out how to fix it and I really  don\'t want to start over. So frustrated.' ,

      'Very realistic and nice game. Missions and descriptions are entertaining. Controls are also great.   Can u add more weather effects and timings like sunset, rain, snow etc. The wipers lie unused in cockpit! What abt adding lights to airplanes -nav, position lights? Some real life airline like texture could be added to make it better.        Overall, one of the best bet for airplane enthusiasts!',
       'Well, THAT. IS. AWESOME ! I suggest to continue developing this game...that about multiplayer mode? What about if you can get money from flights , to buy new planes ? That about making new aircraft types? For example: very big planes can take more passengers to get more money but have low speeds? And other planes which are fast but with less passengers ? And best of all, why not if there is a big map which many players (about 1000 maybe) can buy airports , and transport people to different players airports? Please try and make at least some ideas into ACTION! (Not kidding, this can make the game a blast!) .......I am also sorry for people who find this hard but with some practice you can be an expert!',
       'Its quite good but a little bit of fixing will do. The part "Slow Down thing" can you please please place that where it can not block the view of the player. It is very difficult to see whats behind it so it causes us players to crash. T.Y',
       'Why the hell they add brake when we cannot see the brake option even after landing which forces us to crash. Total stupidity do not waste time in downloading. Previously was better when there were no brakes just reverse it and stop or keep brake button always active.',
       'This game is horrible. THE PEOPLE WHO MADE THIS GAME HAD ONE JOB IT WAS TO MAKE A GOOD GAME AND THEY FAILED!!!!!! Don\'t download this game. The controls are horrible, the background is horrible and, the landings are not possible because of the background and the controls. UNINSTALL this game you are just wasting your time playing this game! UNINSTALL!!!!!!!!üò≤üò†üòæ',
       'Its really boring... You have to do missions you cant just fly around and do whatever you have to fly through the squares and make it to the end... And who wants stripes?! Why are they so important?! Plus its really hard to control!!' ,

      'Seems fun, but there is at least a 10 second ad every time you crash and it\'s really frustrating. I think Acid Cousins is really losing a lot of people to the excessive advertising present in this app even though the game itself has a lot of potential.',
       'It intercepts the back press event and doesn\'t allow to quit in the common way. It continuously places the advertisement banner on the bottom of the page and goes to immersive mode so you\'ll hit the ad instead of navigation bar while you are hopelessly trying to exit. Maybe the game itself is not bad but that disrespect overtakes all the pluses (if they are)',

      'REMOVE TANKS AND ARMOURED SUVS   The game is amazing. All the guns are balanced but there is one big problem... It\'s the TANKS and the SUVS   or make it a banable offence because all people do is camp in the last circle with a tank or a suv. Please fix this and I will rate 5 stars. And I know this is meant to be a minecraft version of pubg but pubg never had tanks or armoured suvs so please fix it. And is it just me but some of the players feel like bots. üòÇ',
       'Problem I have is that it promotes multiplayer use, but you cannot tell who is an actual player or an AI, there is no chat system like it says, and half of anything it talks about is unavailable in the game. The concept itself is great, the game itself is a great time waster, but I have to call it out on its false advertisement.   Now, if I may have been mistaken, someone please correct me, but so far as I can see there is nothing in the game that suggests multiplayer capabilities.',
       'This game is so fun! I didn\'t expect it to be so good. I imagined that this would be like any other game remake, you know, a lot of glitches, bad graphics, and very high sensitivity. But, to my surprise, it was not like that at all. It was better than expected. I\'m going to be playing this game for a long time. I\'ll tell you that much!   This game is an instantüåüüåüüåüüåüüåü!!! - Andrew from Roboticfalcon21 Reviews',
       'I think it is very similar to battle ground and has that pixle theme going on. But I would love this game even more if you guys could make a chat where we could talk to other players',
       'All in all good game but only one major proble is too many ads.  Edit : uninstalled because my upgrades didn\'t stayed upgraded it massed up üñï my dopamine level.',
       'Way to many ads. Ad to get to homescreen ad to get to waiting area, ad to get to arena. On top of that kept jumping back to homescreen and loading another ad instead of going to waiting area. Uninstalled, a shame because it seemed quite good.' ,

      'Difficult but great game. I really enjoyed playing it. Well, it was good but extremely hard. I could reach until level 13 and that was the end of it. But still it was a great experience. I downloaded this game like three times and I believe that your game deserves better than this rating. If I had enough money to donate I would have done that. And thank you for this game.',
       'Maybe it\'s a glitch on some phones but the plane never out runs the guided missile making the game unplayable past level 4. If it wasn\'t for this I would give 4..maybe 5 stars for what could have been.',
       'The movement of the plane is absolutely garbage whenever you accidently pass the height border because of 2 homing missiles and a helicopter squad.  You can\'t control it. So its like accepting your death anyhow.  Fox that and it\'ll be a nice game.',
       'Worst controls. Not hard to play, but there\'s no fun. The plane is too large and too slow to maneuver. I would have liked it if the plane and enemies were somewhat faster',
       'The game is unplayable past 4. Untill we destroy missile launchers the guided missiles runs out the plane. The missiles are too fast then plane speed.',
       'The game is good...Good entertaining...Good graphics.......But there are some drawback....1..When u die , again and again start from 1st  level....2. and plz change its joystick...It\'s not comfortable' ,

      'One of the best wwe games.. even better than immortals.. the difficulty level is always fair when competing with online rivals... gaining loot boxes is also perfect and  not very difficult... I obviously made some In app purchases so I could compete well... just wish to open a loot box and get 1 four star wrestler... things would get awesome I don\'t mind paying for it as well..',
       'STRENGTH : Nice game, wonderful graphics and commentary, great feature of versus and events mode. WEAKNESS : I have spinned loot cases many times but I never got a good superstar. So, purchasing a superstar by using gold or cash should be replaced instead of spinning. Another issue is we cannot remain as a wwe champion as there is no race for championship. Entrance should be added like wwe 2k has done.',
       'Game is good except for one thing. You gotta fix the "Versus" mode. How is it "fair" for me to be level 3 but for my first match online be put up against a level 12?? Makes no sense. Should be match making so you match up with someone close to your own level..',
       'This game is soo frustrating! You cant level up your wrestlers, they dont provide the "basic weight" needed to rank up after you max their level at 10. I have all these fancy other weights and xp boosters...cant use any of it because...no BASIC weights!',
       'At first, I was liking this game, Now, it\'s pissing me off! When your opponent has no energy, How the hell can they reverse when I have full energy and they have none?! Cheat Cheat Cheat! Dont waste your money on this game either! Big Nose Triple Geek had no energy, but beats Shawn at full energy? BS!',
       'It\'s a fun game! It doesn\'t take forever or any real money to level up quick,  current and legendary superstars. Not very complicated controls. I love it. Perfect stress free,  yet challenging game for WWE fans.' ,

      'HACKER infested.  The world of Online Gaming is finished.  Useless.  Pointless.  Every online game, including this one, is filled with hackers.  People are scumbag imbeciles.  No integrity, honor, desire to challenge oneself,  etc.  4 games, back-to-back, perfect dead-center bullseyes, by 4 different people, at the last split-second of their shots.  First time was shocking,  the second I thought odd, the third, very strange and by the fourth it was obvious - there must be a hack for this game.  And 4 back-to-back losers must have used it.  It\'s pretty much the same, anymore, with all online gaming and this game is no different.   Online Gaming is now a complete farce & a waste of time.  Same exact shots, in the same exact way by 4 different scumbags.  The game is pointless because of it.  And the game is a money hog with the number and frequency of adds.  FIX THE HACKING PROBLEM!!!!!',
       'Loving it so far. The time allowed to take aim and shoot is indeed a real challenge. Sometimes makes it frustrating but that\'s what makes this game more challenging and equally interesting I suppose. Could have provided a few more guns and upgrades for us to purchase.',
       'The game is fun and easy to learn, but very hard to get other weapons.  Crates are At least 50,000 and I haven\'t got a new weapon yet',
       'Passes the time, controls OK when you get used to them. You need plenty of nerve and a steady hand.',
       'It\'s hard to aim plus it don\'t give you enough time to shoot it has a add u have to watch every time u want to practice shoot but it\'s still a decent game it could be better if all that I said would be changed in this game. I recommend to try for your own review this is just what I thought about there are alot worse games and this one.',
       'After level 14 there\'s hardly any chance if you\'re not spending buttloads of money these guys are unbeatable and I hit 10+ almost every shot I loved the game but sometimes just impossible to win' ,

      'An awesome game based on tap tap tap. Enchanting bgm. Little customisation of the girl.  Some improvement could be made in that there should be a story. Maybe. There are so many umbras in a country. Destroy them all and that country lights back up. Giving you bonuses and such like. Thus progressing the girls quest to save all the fey and light the world again. Would also give us players something to aim for other than tap tap tap.',
       'This game is amazing!!! The little faries and feys (idk what you call em) are super cute. The grafics are great. And I really like that if you close the game the faries collect the money stuff for you while your away. This game is a great time killer and its so addicting.the little dresses you can pick are really nice too. It will auto attack for you so that\'s nice. The only thing wrong is that the monsters don\'t attack. Over all I really love the game thoughüòä.',
       'The game is beautiful. All the tapping sort of gets to you after a while. I thought the main character would be able to move about and there was more dimension. Like if there were different level in the game and she could move between those levels, etc. Go high and low to cancel out the dark, and so on.',
       'It\'s a great game. The Bgm in the background sounds enchanting and makes me happy while I play the game. The developer might want to add story updates because the girl and Fey have a mission to defeat the evil, but no real mission after you start completing stages. I think it would be nice to have more story in this game.',
       'This game is absolutely NOTHING like everyone thought it was going to be. There really isn\'t much to it other than tapping the screen. Every time you get to character level 650 you can perform  "Light Up!" Which basically ends the current "world" and you start all over again while keeping certain bonuses. It\'s addicting to me and I don\'t know why because unfortunately it\'s pretty basic and boring :(....',
       'AMAZING!!!üëèüëèüëèüëèüëèüëèüëèI loved it I was looking for games to play during a 10 hour car ride, and I found it. Also I got to keep my other games too meaning this doesn\'t take up much storage, Wich is awesome. My only complaint is that the monsters are a little too easy. Even the bosses 1.8k hp 5 seconds later done. Other that that it\'s amazing.' ,

      'It\'s like Cooking Mama from the Wii, but you don\'t have to be accurate at all. There are SO many ads. I mean... They send you an ad like every 30 seconds or so! It\'s a lot. Good game four a you get crowd I think I because it\'s not really a strategy cooking game where you have to time manage and things. It had a decorating feature that I think kids would enjoy. Also, with that feature, a tablet would be better. Or if on a mobile, a stylis.',
       'Nice game... everyone who love cooking should download it. But there is only one problem that the things which are the main are locked and we have to pay the real money or watch s 40 ad. For ex:- In the doll cake we don\'t have the doll so how are we going to bake it.Please fix this problem, otherwise the game is nice.',
       'At first, I was pleasantly suprised this came from TabTales. The lack of pay walls at the beginning is wonderful for their games. Though I\'m not very creative, the game demands it for making food. The graphics look great, gameplay is realistic. I was sad to see a paywal at the princess cake though. If you have 10 dollars and a young girl who loves to cook and bake, by all means buy it for her.',
       'This game is awesome!!!! It makes me go hungry every time I play it!!! The graphics are awesome and very realistic. I luv the fact that it is automatic so you don\'t have to waste your time in perfection... Please keep it automatic like this forever. P.S, for those who are worried about unlocking other stuff like the princess cake, etc. Well, don\'t be, you will get a chance to play it when you unlock the other new bakeries and when you also compete in the competitions.... üòâ',
       'Most of the things r automatic so I rate it 3 or 4 stars. Pls guys pls,pls I want u to make it nonautomatic so that we can play it properly .that\'s all I want to say about this game and most and things are locked these r the two things which I did not like about this game. So guys pls make it properly. Then I will rate it 5 stars for sure. One of the best game I have ever played. Thank u so much',
       'I love the game but it\'s not free.. I\'m not paying for the game and buying money through out the game... Pick one ppl, If it was 5 dollars less count me in but 10 no way! Sorry uninstall ed maybe when I check in again it will be free LOL' ,

      'This game used to be fun, all until the shirts were for VIP only, that\'s why I only play this game 10 times a week, I always wanna see if the shirts are no longer for VIP, but...it never changes...and please, make you purchases cheaper! They are very expensive, and my mom won\'t let me buy none of the VIP stuff  :( Please,fix this, make all the other children playing happy. Nobody deserves to pay for VIP, why don\'t you guys make VIP free? That would make me, and the other girls and boys happy :)',
       'I like the game but can you make VIP free? Because I got a VIP egg now it\'s stuck in my house and I can\'t open it! Btw I play msp and my name  is neon cotton c        Plz',
       'I love the game but you shouldn\'t have to pay to become a VIP that makes people just not want to playüôÉüôÉ it\'s still really great game but still you need to make becoming a VIP free please and thank you',
       'I like all the ones made like movie star planet blockages plane u jam it I like it a lot but games on there are pretty slow and laggy',
       'STOP MAKING EVERYTHING VIP,  MOSTLY EVERYONE CAN\'T GET VIP BECAUSE THEIR PARENTS SAID "NO" IF YOU KEEP MAKING EVERYTHING VIP NO ONE IS GOING TO LIKE THIS GAME SO STOP NOW!!!!!',
       'Well i think if u need a membership to hatch a egg,i think its stupid that you need a mebership for that' ,

      'Cross platform across Apple and Android and PC makes this game a fluid joy to play, without the feeling of a toned down mobile port - due to its 1:1 experience from the PC. It\'s the only Blizzard game u can play on Mobile. I\'m a legend (highest skill tier) ranked and totally F2P so the people who say this game is pay to win or random luck do not understand the game. Paying for is meant for helping you finish your collection fast. Overall highly recommended.',
       'I used to play the old tcg and this not  close to be a good card game. All it is is monster with power, moslty no spell, no artifact, no nothing. This game is boring and is lagging so much on the cellphone. Shadowverse is ways better for a similar formula, has a really good storyline and a waaaaay more generous. When you buy card for HS you get mostly nothing. They had the chance to do something good, everyone love the lore of warcraft, but they BS it.',
       'Lots of fun over and over again. It doesn\'t get boring because of all the expansion updates that keep coming up. You need to readjust your decks to adapt with the new cards that get released. Didn\'t give it a full 5 because of the lag and graphic issues that keep coming up for me and others of the forums.               Playing on a Note 5',
       'No way to begin the game without being decimated by cards I never see available to a new player.  Just geared toward getting me to spend money to HOPE to be able to learn and entice me to spend some cash.  Captive audience I guess..seemed fun but without spending money there is no way to battle other players to progress.   Even the quests are too hard to gain enough.  Just like WoW, which I couldn\'t keep up with monetarily for computer upgrades, good idea but not for the masses, only for the people without bills and responsibility.',
       'There\'s apparently no coming back to this game. If you stop playing for a bit and come back you\'ll never be able to catch up. I\'ve tried building decks but everyone playing has the best cards already and unless I buy card packs I\'ll never catch up.',
       'I LOVE and am an avid player of HS on PC/Mac but this mobile app needs to update every few hours to everyday. It is absurd, annoying, and discouraging for mobile play.' ,

      'Ads are everywhere in this game. For a 2 year old who doesn\'t understand  how to exit out of the ad is frustrating. Ya, you have the ad free option for $2.99 but when I searched for "free apps for 2 year olds" this shouldn\'t come up in the search. Apps for toddlers should never have ads in them.',
       'Such a good game! My 1.5 year old loves it and it was so amazing watching him learn how to put the shapes into the correct places. There\'s about 9 categories I think so it doesn\'t ever get boring- you can choose from many different shapes. The only complaint is the ads are getting worse -  it used to be just at the bottom where my son could accidently press it, but now they actually appear overriding the game and you have to watch for 30 sec and can\'t exit... Hard for a child to understand he has to wait to get back to his game. If it gets any worse my rating will go down.',
       'News flash to the developers, a game designed for toddlers shouldn\'t have ads that toddlers can open, popping up between each round.',
       'Wayyyyyyy too many adds. Game is great but literally after every puzzle which takes 3 mins or less to do for a 2yr old there are 2- 3 ads!!!',
       'Is there a way to lower the sensitivity of placement so the piece doesn\'t have to be exactly over the empty shape?',

      'Game is great. And like every game had it\'s pro\'s and con\'s. To sum this game up in short it is Top Trumps with the race.   Pros: game is different to all the rest out there, car list is really well thought out as well.  Cons the only things I have to say is, it\'s so hard to win decent cars sometimes. Seems quite a pay to win game as card packs are alot of money/gold and you don\'t win alot of money either.   One thing to bare in mind is that once you\'ve completed a level you can go back and claim all the cards from that event giving you more money, cars and rq.',
       'First download crashed and wouldn\'t load. Had to reinstall the game and Hutch games couldn\'t recover my profile so had to start again from scratch. I\'ve played through several updates and fixes but the same issues remain, car X beats car y when it shouldnt. Hutch in game support agree there is a problem and send to devs but nothing gets fixed. The whole game seems flawed. To be competitive to you will have to spend about ¬£50 a month. I enjoy the premise but the game is poorly executed.',
       'Fun game that I do still enjoy... BUT more/different content needs to be added as far as events and practice races.  Also I have been VERY dissapointed with the support team, so it is too bad I wont be spending more on this one until I see improvements.',
       'Hey, after the update, I can\'t access my previous account so I have to start over. Is this new update a scam or what? What is happening with this game and why can\'t we access our old account?',
       'This is an amazing game and I think Hutch Games did an amazing job putting the collecting and racing features of the game together. Buying packs is very expensive, but in some ways it is a nice challenge to work hard to get the thrill of opening a pack. I love being able to collect and race so many real cars. For a suggestion however, I think it would add a lot to the game if Hutch Games made it so there was a section where you could put the cars that your keeping only for collecting. It would just be easier to get them away from the cards that your using to race.',

      'This is not another Clash of Clans clone, but definitely pushes the boundaries of the clan genre. Good graphics, fun gameplay, and balanced in terms of units vs. defences for your island. While diamonds can be purchased by real-world money, the game doesn\'t trap you into needing them. The weekly mini-game missions help keep things fresh and assist in moving your base up the tech tree if you\'re patient. SuperCell is continually expanding the game to keep it interesting. Definitely worth a download!',
       'I really wish you could change your name more the once. You should be able to get 2 name changes. I started with my regular name and then changed it. I don\'t care for my in game name anymore. I just want to change the spelling. Is there any way you guys can make that happen please. We are also.looking fornsome good players to join our task force come and look for us the name is skippy71601',
       '√ÆnstaII " UNOPAY " App Enterr (GEMSO) to Start Earmings So far so good.Fun way to get money. Won\'t make you rich but the extra cash is helpful. It\'s also the best exchange rate on points. Uno points equals uc instead of like some of the others where it takes Uno points to reach uc etc....Also, √ÆnstaII " SUZICASH " App Enterr (SUHA) very reliable in paying you when you redeem to waIet/GEMs. You can choose assorted giftcards as payment or transfer to waIet for cash. Your choice. I love these guys thanks for addingsome fun to my day.',
       'Very addictive and always checking on my base, upgrades etc. Strategic game play, however too much pressure to buy diamonds as it takes FOREVER! !! for some things to upgrade. Seriously. ..2 days for an upgrade??? Only other issue is the limited time "special abilities"...they\'re fun but it makes it far too easy for someone to raid your base and take all resources needed to get the upgrades. Lots of fun and love the graphics',
       'To be honest, boom beach is da best game I have ever played!!!! My headquarters is lvl 10 but lol my dad\'s is lvl 21 and I feel sorry for my Bro (lvl 6 hq). Thx so much supercell! ‚ò∫ I think it\'s better than gta v!',
       'You call this a game ? It\'s a pathetic piece of garbage. A total piece of shyt game like all supersuckcell games. Look at all the fake good reviews lol.

      'This is a very entertaining game that is simple to play. It has provided me with hours of fun! The only thing is that I wish there were more combinations, there are things I\'ve tried that you\'d think would make something but don\'t. For example, Crayon (or Pencil, or Charcoal, or Paint) + Paper does not make Art.',
       'Such a fun game!! I love that you can watch an ad to get hints instead of ads just popping up all the time like other free games. I\'ve been a fan since the first one and this one is way better! Cuter graphics and more information about the things you create. Great way to pass the time in a no-stress, purely fun way!',
       'This game is pretty addicting. I get stuck sometimes but I always find something new.  Small issue though, I it won\'t let me pull rust out onto the screen for some reason. I\'ve used it before, but now it won\'t let me use it anymore. Perhaps it is an issue with my phone rather than a glitch in the app.',
       'This is leagues better than the original alchemy game. There were a lot of bugs but they\'ve all more or less been patched out. It took me 2 months of playing everyday to get all of the items and combinations cleared.',
       'I love this game so much. I\'m stuck on trying to make life but it\'s not frustrating it\'s challenging and I like it. Also, for all the people getting pissed off because the items disappear and you cant \'use\' them anymore it\'s because you can\'t combine them with anything anymore so it is put in your encyclopedia so that doesn\'t waste space for the things you can use, it\'s actually a very smart game mechanic. I\'m pretty sure it even says that in the tutorial. I also like how they didn\'t take the same combination formulas from the first game and instead added new ways to achieve the same product in a more realistic way, also there is so many items to create! So I think that this is an all around great game. Good job developers. Good job indeed.',
       'Its a cool game. If you press the hint button it gives you a choice to watch a ad for help. I am not seeing in-app purchases so far and I have had this game for a while! I recommend this but not the other version. It gets a tiny bit boring after a while though. overall, GREAT GAME! Whoever made this game is great! :) :) :)' ,

       'How does one finish speedrunner 1? I tried purchasing a few upgrades as possible. I purchased 2 money upgrades for Jofu, a speed and money upgrade for Cula and Byldo and the 2 fruit teirs. I can\'t obtain Ony before 11 minutes. Maybe one should set the objective as unlock Byldo in 5 minutes instead.',
       'Oh man, this has held my attention almost as long as cookie clicker. It has plenty of extra stuff to keep the gsme fresh, like the challenge mode or golden fruit achievements. Really looking forward to any other additions the developers are planning. Especislly the animated worms, the movement is so smooth.',
       'I love this game for how relaxing it is. One thing I would love would be to be able to move the pens for wash worm around and customise the lay out.  Other then that I feel what ever else this game will throw at me will be just fine. Keep up the good work^^',

      'Have had this app for several months and almost always have fun and the support team do their job fabulously. "UPDATE:"  May 2017, It has now been over a year I\'m still spinning, having fun. It is now mid July 2017 and I\'m still having fun and give it 6 stars but it will only let me do 5! "Update:" We\'re now into mid November and I\'m still happy and still spinning! I am now into February 18, still knocking them dead. Fabulous Fun! Come join in.',
       'I would give it a 4.5 but can\'t. It is very addictive I just wish the login bonuses were better. And when you spin the wheel don\'t get too excited. Very rarely do you get more than $2500. But I gotta say it\'s my favorite slot game. You should bring back that Tiki Slot. That was fun. I\'m really in to the Tigers slot machine now.',
       'I love this Game App! My hubby was giving me the hardest time when I first started playing it...and now he is hooked just like me! I had the best time playing the different games that Are usually locked during the Thanksgiving holiday when all games open. Only complaint would be it takes too long to open unlock games ... People would buy more coins if more games to play we\'re available instead of spending coins trying to unlock games.  I personally spent more cash on coins during the all games open.',
       'This continues to improve.The original variety was fun, but each new game just seems to get better.  The graphics were always good, but the new ones are truly impressive, and fun.  The way they are combining multiple features of earlier games offers more play options and payoffs.  Almost impossible to put down. Bad luck suddenly reverses and is FUN!',
       'I like the games but.. I would rather go to a real casino if i wanna spend and win REAL money, so buying coins with REAL money just for innocent playtime is a Big turn off for me. You lose coins fast like the real slots, unfortunately. I just start playing the game for the first time and I\'m already out of coins. I believe they start you off with a low amount because I\'m already out of coins in 30mins of play. The games and the graphics are fun though, which makes it attractive to play. My only complaint is paying for those coins..',
       'Fantastic game! Best one in Google play store! Where else would semi- intelligent dogs pay real $$ with t he chance of winning 0 in real cash back, only for the fun of it! Brilliant! That being said, Ill keep on playing!Only slot game I never get tired of playing! Games are very realistic, and the graphics are great! Be careful though, able to go through a lot of money quickly because the games are so addicting!' ,

      'Good game. Needs a seeding system. Getting bored of being killed by players 10-15 levels above me. Spawn points need looking at too. Keeps respawning at the same point I just died at. There appears to be some hacked players too. Just shot 1 guy 7 times in the head and he took it and shot me back once which was enough to kill me',
       'So many people using modified apk to paly... Very few gamers playing ethically.. makers must do something about it.    New update is not stable.  After Every 5 min. It shows that my wifi got disconnected, though my wifi is already connected. Didnt face any problem like this in Previous version.',
       'When I am in a tank attacking my opponent, it does not hit the opponents tank and the person in the other tank would not respond because I guess they don\'t see me. But the other players not mounting any tank would see my tank and attack it. Also when my opponent is attacking or being attacked by my players it doesn\'t show the opponent\'s location on the map. Please fix this Also can you give us an option of selling weapons which we no longer need?',
       'This game is awesome if i compare with others but it needs improvement if you make exception. Problem is that lack of enough ammunition untill death. Sollution is that you can give ammunition around war places so that we can take and reload ammunition. Tank destroyer luncher has only 3 ammunition but there are so many tanks!! So what i can do? I will kill myself to get ammunition?',
       'This game is an absolute joke unless you spend actual money. I spent weeks EARNING gold coin and tried to upgrade my armor and it failed!! How does my purchase fail?!! And your playing against people with 140% health and crazy armor points so you can\'t kill anyone unless you try to upgrade your armor. Then on top of all that you have people who hack the game and run around killing people with no deaths. Complete rip off.',

      'This is one of the best flip games I have played in a long time. Love the way they have implemented the physics in the game. It is like flipping the real thing. Every knife has it\'s own style of flipping. The collection is also amazing. Best part you don\'t need to buy gold for knifes. You can earn it. Some of the blades are paid but won\'t mind buying them as it is worth. Amazing job people üëç',
       'Hi! The game is amazing. Simple, yet very addictive. The color scheme is amazing, and the sounds are great. But I do have one little complaint ; Sometimes the "Card" knife doesn\'t stick into the log when it lands on the tip, although it should clearly stick and count as a point. Have a wonderful rest of your day :)',
       'REALLY FUN AND INTERESTING. i like how there is a very large variety of knives available to get. A few problems : i am not willing 2 pay money for a knife in a game, it glitches and lets me watch infinite vids 4 infinite money, some of the knives are really stupid',
       'This is a great time-passer (if you finally have some spare time) , good graphics, and mostly good physics.    However, I recently discovered that players are punished via a lock timer for marathoning advertisements to unlock knives... Why?',
       'A fun and addictive game but there are some issues with the game\'s economy. It\'s all about collecting the different knives but to do that you need a large amount of money which is earned the fastest with the expensive knives (Or just watching ads). The knife you may enjoy the most may only be 1 coin per flip so you feel forced to use another one worth 2 or 3 that you don\'t enjoy as much. I would like to see a system implemented that lets you upgrade a knife to be worth more so you have an incentive to try and use new knives that aren\'t initially worth 3 coins per flip but can be upgraded to be worth 3.',
       'Great visuals, smooth physics, and addicting Gameplay. Great game, my only thing I\'d change would be the end-game knives, past 10k all the knives kinda suck, and have awful \'flipability\', making it pointless to save up for anything above 10-15k. If you added a better variety of knives into the game this would be a 5 star.  Also, this game hasn\'t been updated since early December 2017. Please update it.' ,

       'Love the concept but ads after every round? And to make it worse.. Bloody too blast ad 4 in a row. Lower  your ads, get rid of the too blast ad and I\'ll uprated 10 fold. Also you could make the game better with a timer ;)',
       'Since the update on the game I can not get the ads to go away. You have to completely exit the game then go back into it in order to go to the next level. Little frustrating, aside from that I really enjoy the game itself.',
       'The update is not good. This is not working on oppo. When we trying to open this game. Mobile is hanging and It is automatically close. Before update there is no any problems',
       'Game is fun but I keep getting an ad every other match. They are skip able ads bit that doesn\'t take away how annoying it is.',
       'Oh my god this game is soooo realxong and addicting and i don\'t think there is a lot of adds but it just gets your mind off things and i think i would recommend this game to everyone! 5 stars!üòçüòçüòçüòç' ,
