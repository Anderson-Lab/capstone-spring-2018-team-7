     [ 'This game seems like it could be a great time waster... If it weren\'t for the whole crashing after every round when it tries to load an ad or when you try to watch an ad to upgrade something for free. I see nothing wrong with having these ads here.... As long as they don\'t affect app stability',
       'To everyone complaining about the ads, quit being so cheap and give the $2.49 to buy the game and remove them. Once the ads are removed, it\'s addictive and fun to keep getting the ball further. Fun concept and well executed. I\'ve already gotten more than my $2.49 worth of fun out of this game, and continue to play it.',
       'Too easy of a game. Once u upgrade ur strength to 30 plus you have to take into account of the angles. You never want to hit the ball perfect because it\'s  Impossible to hit the ball flush that it aligns with the dotted lane. Oh yeah for those saying ads, turn off the Wi-Fi and play.',
       'It\'s ok...not something I am going to keep. Good for like 5 min then the adds getting a bit much after every other at bat. I understand making revenue but a bit much after 1 or 2 hits. Plus I don\'t know if it was my device but the only sound I got from this game was the adds. No hit sounds or music or even hearing the sound of the ball hitting anything. Good concept, could have been designed and presented better.',
       'The concept is great and it\'s very addictive. I don\'t like the fact that hitting a ball just outside the "Perfect" range will actually make it much further than it does when you get a perfect hit. It also doesn\'t make sense that the ball bounces keeps rolling on water but as soon at you hit the leaves of a tree you bounce backwards. Also the ads.. way too many ads.',
       'Way too many adds. The game its self looks rather fun. But after 5 minutes in the game, and spending 3  minutes of them watching ads it was time to delete. I have no issues in watching a couple of ads to help the developers, but this was way over the top. Other than the ad frequency though, looks like it could be fun.' ],

     [ 'I love it very much. I also have some sugjestons to make. I think you should make categories for Thu pictures (animals,people,food,ect) and also have a daily challenge where you have to finish a picture (that you say) and we have to finish it. You would get a prize of a amount of coins and you could save them up to buy new pictures or tools like the bomb. But i really like this game. So even if you don\'t do my sugjestons I will still love it. ❤❤❤',
       'In my humble opinion, this game is truly a work of art and talent. This game can be used by people of all skill levels, due to the variations of complexity and difficulty within each pixel art piece. And it\'s just bursting and overflowing with hundreds, maybe even thousands of art pieces. There are hours of fun and relaxation awaiting you, and what a way it is to pass the time. Even better, it is appropriate for ages of all kind, including small children.Overall, I recommend this to anyone willing, for this is truly glorious.',
       'AMAZING GAME! I am SOOOOOO HAPPY with this game! ITS SOO ADDICTIVE TO PLAY! SOOO MANY PICTURES TO CHOOSE FROM! THERE\'S EVEN A TRUMP ONE(which is EXTREMELY funny)! THIS IS THE-BEST-GAME-EVER THAT I HAVE PLAYED!I LOVE THIS GAME SOOO MUCH THAT YOU, YES YOU, SHOULD GO DOWNLOAD PIXEL  ART RIGHT NOW! YES RIGHT NOW! SO GO AHEAD AND DOWNLOAD IT!!! (also this is the longest thing i have EVER typed on my phone!)',
       'I love this game! There are so many pictures to color! This game will keep me occupied for hours! I just love how creative they are! But one question...Why do more pictures come by and take the place of my new colored ones? Like, why do more pictures come by everyday? It\'s kind of frustrating to color the new ones and then more appear the next day. Please fix, or stop the glitch. Overall, great game.☺',
       'I love this game and both myself n my grandbabies love doing the pics. It would b awsome to have n categories or level of pic. Didn\'t know about the bomb and other help. I would also suggest to move or when u r doing pic for the back button n save button to hide . I\'m always intrupting my pic by hitting the by accident . N also to b able to open the pic at a spot by touches instead of expanding pic. Expecially for more detailed pics. Love it Ty .',
       'Awesome app, its oddly satisfying and can either be really challenging ir really easy. Its constantly update with new pictures to do, and already contains probably hundreds lol, if dont 75+ and in saving the really detailed ones for last. If there even is such a thing. But, i think a counter for how many blocks of each color are left would be a really awesome alteration. There are many strategies to use when you do a color by number. So a counter for how many blocks of the selected number are left, it would be such a life save.this game has taken enough of my life already as is lmao' ],

     [ 'Would of gaven 5 stars. But there some bugs that need to be worked out. Like connection and handling. But other then that this game is really close to PUGB for the phone. Massive open world. COULD do little better on the mechanic of the game but nothing to major. Would like to have a better money earn system like small amout per kill or something. This game is well dont. Ive played almsot all games on gogole play and when i say this game is fun I MEAN IT!!..',
       'I like the game, but I have a few things I would like added. One thing is instead of joystick controls maybe there could be an option that allows you to have buttons to move like in vehicle mode where you can switch from the gas pedal to the four buttons. Also I would love a first person mode, I think that would make the game so much cooler and better, just a new way of playing. And Maybe a mode like a TDM would be cool. Just some suggestions, thanks for reading love the game!',
       'It was a good game till there is alot of cheater. Please ban all those hacker@cheater. I have been killed by so many cheater. They can shoot through wall n walk through it. How the fuck am i suppose to win a game like this. Sadly it was a good game till you guys stop doing the job n enjoy all the money from people who buy diamond n do not ban all those cheater.',
       'Thank you for constantly improving the game. Id say at this point not to add more but to fix and adjust what you already have. Fine tuning before more additions would be great. Optimizing sounds, movements, vehicles, rendering, scoping, responses, all that good stuff would be great. Its a little laggy but thats just what you get for a giant game and 100 million+ players. Love it either way.',
       'Fun game, especially since it\'s free. But I saw that this game supports controllers so I tried to use my pro switch controller with it and so far only 2 buttons seem to work, as well as a huge delay from input to actual action. And I can\'t seem to customize the controller layout, so I\'m just stuck with the Ability to walk and crouch/lay down with said controller. Can\'t aim or shoot.',
       'The game has so much potential they just need to make it easier to see other players and easier to shoot people close to you. Also the game doesn\'t need to look realistic they should make it more like fortnite graphics and gameplay wise.  My main point is that it is too hard to see others in the game. still a good game though' ],

The only reason that it is still 4 stars from me is because the games are really good. I will be deleting app if I get locked out again. And I am sure you would not like that.',
       'I love love love this game it is so fun but 1.it has alot of clickbaited games and 2.now you have to open the app to design your character and when I press that button it says :error cannot open the app 3. It always kicks me out of games like robloxian high school.',
       'This app is great and has tons of different games. It has simple but effective animations. You can look for various game modes and play them. The app also allows you to create a custom avatar. The only downside is a few of these games are not quite appropriate for younger ages. Overall, its a great app and is rather easy to use.' ],

It\'s really fun to play when you need some time to get away from problems or just when your bored.

     [ 'I love decorating the rooms but I am having to pay too much to get enough points to do it.   I also don\'t like that each room requires more points to do the tasks than the previous room.  I have changed my rating to low because you end up spending too much of your own money to get powerful to get your stars to complete the tasks.  They also lose your purchases.  I bought a desk chair yesterday and now it is missing and the task is gone too.  Rip off.',
       'Its a nice game! But it just takes forever to open a new level. Sometimes your on one for days. That\'s just to long. That\'s why I pay farm inland. You can play for hours with out bring stopped no lives. . I want a game that\'s fun and relaxing. No hard or extra hard ones. I really like cleaning and fixing thing. Be nice if you could do more area and less puzzle.',
       'Veeery enjoyable game! I feel like it\'s advertised too much, but it\'s definitely worth playing. Especially if you love games like Bejeweled!  Some of the levels are unnecessarily difficult to get by. You have to either get lucky, or be some type of strategic genius to pass them within a good time frame. That\'s slightly disappounting. Its too much of an encouragement to use money.',
       'Homescapes is an awesome game, combining the relaxation (and frustration!) of match 3 games with the joy of renovating a fabulous mansion. Throw in the fascinating story line, lovable characters lovely music and stunning graphics (except the kitchen wallpaper lol), I\'ll be playing this for a long time! I\'m working on the living room right now, getting close to level 600. Can\'t wait to see what the new character, Jerry, has in store for us! Thank you Playrix!',
       'I really like this Game so Far. I will play for awhile to See how it Works & If I like it. Absolutely Love Your Game. Play it ALL THE TIME!!! I Must Admit that I Really Do enjoy this Game! Sometimes I find myself Having a Hard Time With Certain Levels. I Could be On that Level for Days or a Few Weeks. I think with Some Improvement that Would make People Play. This Game More. But I Must Say Hat\'s Off to The Developers',
       'Love it! It just needs some adjustments. Too many levels that are way too hard, that takes you 50 tries to beat when you only have 5 lives in the first place. And it should only be beat one level to unlock one task instead of needed to beat two levels to unlock one task. If it\'s going to take 2 stars to unlock a task it should be something big not 2 stars for unlocking a task for cleaning up a little mess!' ],

And thank you so so so so much.But I saw one mistake you were making that was if a player just tap a white tile you would make it out . So don\'t make the player out. Give it at least 5 chances. So that he can make his or her best high score. Please try to make it more interesting . And also when we reach higher you make it faster and faster. Otherwise this game is the best of all games.',

You will not get bird of it. I stay up at night just to play this. That is because it is so fun.you can play it on any device to any device. Is you have a tablet or computer or phone or maybe even a TV if you have a quote if you could get that since the best and if you can\'t get it you should get it it\'s free I mean free this good of a game that\'s free which is amazing.that is way you should get this app.get it now why you she\'ll can.

And not to mention the game starts to really lag when they get over 600k players (take in mind it seems they always wait for the game to start until they get 1 million players). Again fun at first but it soon looses it\'s shine not long after. This is an app to come and go. Cool thing is it\'s free and it\'s trivia questions that are really hard and random. Good luck!',
       'Great and addicting fun. You might not win at first but once you do it\'s so satisfying, making you want to come back for more. My only gripe is the lives as you have very little, but if you do want a guaranteed one use my code: Michlale',

At this current state there isn\'t much point going for the prize when the app will physically present me from progressing',

We may write the Queen\'s English in Canada, but we usually have no idea what is common culture in the UK. We watch American programming. Switch us Canucks back. SITUATION FIXED',

I have recently lost a life though, for some reason, although I have not asked to use a life, which is annoying. This is another thing that detracts me from using this app',
       'Game has lag time bad. Tonight I couldn\'t see the question until after the answer was read, eliminating me. I have a great phone,  Samsung s7, problem is on their end... too much traffic for their servers I believe. Need ways to get more lives too. I referred someone but never got a life.

     [ 'So I think just about everyone has heard of this game... Buuuuuuut there are some newbies here so I\'ll explain. Its a multiplayer game and It\'s in my opinion that It is probibly #2 best game I\'ve ever played. Great concept and I like to get creative on makeing a snake/worm thing. A+ grade. 👌👍',
       'The controls are more difficult than the last time I played this game, which was a year or so ago. The new customization is very cool 👌 but the fact that even the joystick (my usual preference) doesn\'t make it better at controlling. I don\'t know whether it is because of my phone or if it is in the app. Nevertheless good job, game is very addictive, keep up the good work 👌',
       'this game is a thousand times better than agar.io in my opinion! It\'s so much easier to get onto the leader board. Every time I play I get onto the leader board. It\'s just so addicting and I can\'t get enough. Everyone in my family loves it too. Creating your own skin is a great option as well. My only complaint is that the \'play online\' option is very laggy, and if you fix it would be much appreciated. Thanks for a great game, from sinéad, ella, lauren, mollie, shane and ollie 😊😊',
       'I\'ve recently upgraded from cubot to galaxy s7 and unfortunately the game is not working properly like it did on the old cubot phone. The screen gets stopping and it\'s impossible to play. I\'ve tried uninstalling and changing Wi-Fi settings but nothing worked. Other than that the game is sick! Love it,my kids love it and it\'s fun to play.',
       'Should allow us to be able to control the speed with a bar level instead of the button. Should make online controllers like offlines. Faster and more sensitive to move. And add a special rare star that floats around the screen rarely that doubles your size by eating it. No matter how big you are. That would be interesting.',
       'This is better than the browser version for multiple reasons. 1) It doesn\'t lag as much. I played a few rounds a noticed a little bit of lag, but it\'s better than the browser version.  2) You can play against AI if you don\'t want to play against people. I like this because I actually had a chance to win and was able to kill some. 3) You can create your own custom skin, which is awesome. All of this is free as well. I love this version of Slither.io.' ],

     [ 'Absolutely love all of the geometry dash games! Colors and graphics are awesome, game play is challenging but fun, and the music is perfect! Only thing I can complain about is that I wish all of the levels from these free versions were in the full version. I own the full version and would much prefer to be able to play these levels without ads and with all of the cool characters and colors I have unlocked. Other than that though, amazing work you guys, keep it up!',
       'Woah. WOAH. WWOOAAHH!!! Oh. Another Chllenging game but thhe only thing i like in it tha it has Dantdm\'s Old Intro at the press start! Wow. I am pro at Geometry Dash Games and another one oh yea and there is Sub Zero(MK) name there like i saw them quickly. And i would say for the creator: plz. Creator keep the good work! Ok!!! And make more Geometry Dash and can u make something more fun for more people to play with!!!',
       'Oh my god... This is the best geometry dash free game I have ever played,  and is almost more fun than the full version.  Robtop, you have regained full respect after what happened with meltdown. I\'m just speechless, at the amount of work that was put into these three levels, going from the camera angles to the animations. This game is not like meltdown,  which is three short amateur levels, but with three long, harder levels. This game is like a preview to 2.2, and I know it\'s going to be good.  We\'ll done, Robtop! Keep up the great work!',
       'This game is awesome!! Just one thing... You might want to fix Power Trip, because if you miss the gravity pad in the robot part it\'s pretty much an insta-win. I don\'t know if it was meant to be there but if it wasn\'t, you should probably put some spikes there or something.',
       'This just blows my mind... one thing I would like to see in the future is some rob-top made tutorials on how each editing items works in the game so other players can feel more comfortable making their own levels and not be intimidated by all the other fan made levels... I am one of those players who is intimidated by the other fan made levels... This could help young and creative minds to create their own levels their friends can enjoy. Thanks 10/10',
       'I love this game so much.  Some of the effects and colours added into the game make it so fun to play and watch. Its challenging and thats what makes it fun. Its not like one of those games that are so easy you finish it in an hour. This game takes time and effort. Also the backround music is pretty cool. Especially nock em with headphones. controls are very easy to use, just tap to jump and usually hold to use the vehicles, so easy! This game is perfect and absolutely fun. I would highly recommend downloading geometry dash subzero.' ],

     [ 'Let\'s be honest. This game is very similar to every other choice game. You have to wait 3 hrs for another ticket and I don\'t mind that BUT the storylines are CHEESY! Like damn, I don\'t even feel  the chemistry between the characters, you all should work on that. Also, the why you all draw the Black characters is simply awful. Work on the way you color the lips and draw the face. I hate to say it, but overall, this game is basic. It\'s a work in progress, READ your reviews and actually listen to what they are saying.',
       'It\'s pretty good. I am going to save this application for now. Right now I am reading the Campus hacker story. I really do like the humor in it but I kind of find the characters rude LOL. I\'m only on the first book so I don\'t want to give up yet. I have four other reading applications and this one honestly is my least favorite as of right now but I would definitely recommend it and give it a shot.',
       'I think this and most of the game since choices came out are all rip offs of episode choose your story. Now I\'m not saying they are bad apps or stories I just wish some of these people knew about episode. Though I have to admit this game is pretty fun.',
       'In the past I loved my shelf, now I kinda like it. Untold Darkness was amazing... Then I read Untold Darkness 2, I was very unhappy about it. I had hoped it was a continuation of the first, but it restarted just like the first. One of the things that got me upset was that it changed things, like not knowing Eugene, and Eddie, also I disliked how I had to meet everyone else again.  I really think there shoud be a continuation of the first Untold Darkness though, it\'s my favorite.',
       'I kinda liked it. I finished untold darkness book 1 before giving up. I also started reading a couple others to be fair. I didn\'t really like untold darkness until later on in the book, and was eager to start the second but very disappointed in the second one. I felt like my choices didn\'t really effect the outcome.',
       'This is so much better than any other of these types of games,there is no lagging at all. I love the graphics, there so life like. I am currently reading untold darkness book 1,and I can\'t wait to find out what happens next. Really glad that I downloaded it.' ],

     [ 'Love word games. Great brain teaser and time passer. Would recommend it. I know people complain of adds but it\'s the ads that keeps the games free and it helps as sponsors so all I do is just deal with it. It\'s a whole ten to thirty seconds out of life. Not a big deal considering it\'s FREE.',
       'I love word cookies! ❤When my little cousin play this game, it helps her to learn how to spell better. She loves word cookies too.💙 I recommend people to download this game because if you have a little sibling, your little sibling will learn how to spell more and more. This game is really helpful.😃😀☺😄',
       'I like this game a lot but there are some challenges. 1. It drains my phone\'s battery. So the only time I play it is when I\'m at home.  2. It makes my phone\'s temperature skyrocket. 3. The fact that there are ads is a bit annoying. And I understand that they\'re necessary. But do they ALL have to be so long? 4. Why doesn\'t the "Free Coins" option work anymore? I push the button and nothing happens.',
       'I really love this game because it helps me learn how to spell and also is very helpful by telling us that we are spelling it wrong and lets us try again. This game is addictive and easy to play and also it is VERY fun. HOWEVER, it kinda frustrates me when I need coins to do things, like when I wanna skip. The coins to me they are not very useful. BUT other than that this is a great games for kids and spelling test. Some of these words are hard to spell. A thing I want them to add to the game is an topic about anything and we can spell words that are in that topic. That is all I have to say.',
       'Pointless. Stupid. Kids come home from school and run to their rooms to see their best friends in the world. Phones. Aflter a long hard day at school. And pages upon pages of homework, they want nothing to do with math, history,ECT. Personally, my least favorite subject is spelling. Why come home to thousands of notifications about SPELLING. Ligit. Go find a child who likes to spell. I think not.',
       'Update FEB 26  2018 STILL WILL NOT SYNC BETWEEN DEVICES!   This game is quite addictive. Would be nice if they backed off the ads between moves tho.  UPDATE MARCH 3RD 2017.  ...  I switched devices.  On my first game I was well into the Talented CHEF level. I had well over 2500 tokens.  I had it synced to my Facebook account.. still have to start over. So. I just deleted the game.  Data sync NOT WORKING AT ALL.  UNINSTALLING IT.  Tired of. Starting over everytime i log in from a different device or having to reset phone or tablet.' ],

     [ 'It\'s fun and addictive. Aiming is relatively easy, and upgrades are relatively cheap, so you can level up your weapon quick. The graphics are simple, but considering everything else, it\'s nothing to complain about. This is on a phone after all, not a PS4. However, nearly all weapons besides the hunting rifle, though possible to attain, require an insane amount of in game currency. So unless you like micro transactions, or have an insane amount of free time, you\'ll probably only ever have the hunting rifle. 8.5/10',
       'There\'s too many disconnection playing online when you have to watch a video to earn to Diamonds for free sometimes it does not play you lose that opportunity. They need to upgrade a little better quality on the connection situation. Is it worth investing your real money into this game the answer is no. Unless they fix the situation',
       'Don\'t care for the fact that most the "targets" are of brown skin. Just going to show exactly how prejudice ya really are? Disgusting and immoral! I thought all lives matter, not just the alt right, or white supremacy. Fix and the game could be great. It\'s always a white man shooting a black and this is why there\'s a problem.',
       'Good graphics but the character movements are clunky.  I\'m a hardcore FPS gamer and I like to test the limitations of a game.  So tried shooting a shoulder and the bullet went for a headshot instead whereas I clearly know my aim would miss. Glitchy.  Clunky and not so realistic unfortunately.  So not sure why the high ratings.',
       'Still full of annoying bugs. The worst game I ever played. Earnings are exactly layed out so that you can\'t level up as you should and in a way that you should spend a lot of money... 👎 Graphic & other bugs, really not fluid etc. 👎 Full of annoying ads 👎 Some can shoot through walls; but you can\'t. Some can see you behind walls, but you can\'t. Starting pvp, you get placed on the map with the back to the others. Your oponents have 10x stronger weapons... Fairplay 👎 Nothing is balanced fairly in pvp 👎',
       'Yeah man cool game, however we must ask ourselves if weed is a gateway drug maybe shooting games are a gateway to more sinister things but no one give a hoot about it hahahaha I like playing games. Hi, 5 stars. Food next 2' ],

     [ 'Me and my son have had fun with this game and made an attempt to collect all characters. The game is set up so you can not earn all of the characters but have to buy the last couple in a cash grab. It would be fine if they we\'re only available for real money but the game gives the illusion that you can win them in a chest. One that we have spun over 50 times without success',
       'Great timewaster! There are a lot of characters to earn and you don\'t need to spend real money to get them, so that\'s a plus. However, rated it a 3 cuz there are sooooo many ads. I get that ads generate the revenue to keep a good game free but an ad populates for literally every action. Win a game=ad, lose a game=ad, go to the settings=ad, change the volume=ad... ok the last one is fictitious but it really seems like that\'s how it works',
       'Love the game, its fun, addictive, and challenging. It makes you actually think before you do anything. The ads really are a bit much, being that after every single round in a tournament there is one. Also, one major thing, keep up with the updates. IOS users seems to have gotten an update with new characters and pvp mode even but not android',
       'The game is simple to immediately start playing and fun. I shouldn\'t rate a game based off of this but, these pop up adds are tremendously common. Adds are essential so that the app can support itself but to have an add after every single play and then have an add to open a chest? Really? That\'s a bit much, especially, when the adds are not easily skippable and even force you to the download screen of the add. The game is simple, fun, and has witty, silly, and quirky characters. But the adds are a bit much.',
       'The game is amazing, and the ads help them make money, if you made a game this good would just want to let people play it? No, you would want a reward. The only things I don\'t like is that the land is sometimes unfair, my phone randomly mutes, and on my old phone I had this and there were more characters but not now on this phone',
       'The game itself is enjoyable and the controls are quite simple. Very intuitive. But Jesus Christ on a frosty log, the ads are way to much. After every round, ad, want your prize? Ad. Wanna do anything in the game? Enjoy the ad. Jesus guys, I don\'t mind ads and I understand that\'s how you make money, but you shouldn\'t have to watch an ad to get your prize for winning...

     [ 'AMAZING! The graphics are stunning and the story lines are so good! Just 2 things I would improve to make the game even better:      •Less time to wait for more keys (4 hours is quite long).      •The diamond cost is really high considering the fact we get one diamond after every story chapter we play and having to wait so long for keys.  Other than that...AMAZING JOB WELL DONE!',
       'The stories are great but to enjoy them properly, you have to spend diamonds. Free diamonds at the beginning is way too less (25 diamonds). And you earn 1 diamond per chapter, which is less because to make premium choices you have to spend so much more diamonds (min. 12 diamonds for a choice). And you have to make at least one premium choice per chapter. Buying the diamonds is way too expensive. I think the developers should allow users to earn more diamonds in the game. Maybe make them watch a video to earn free diamonds. That would certainly help...',
       'Really fun but I wish you gave us more than 2 keys. I\'m not going to spend actual money on a short story but I\'m sure a lot of others will, which is great for you but I think 2 keys is a little low since there are numerous chapters to play and many stories to choose from. Would be cool if you would match most other games and give us 5 keys for gameplay.',
       'Love the story lines, the graphics, all of it. Would have liked to seen something that can be done to regenerate the diamonds or do something to earn more diamonds other than finishing a new chapter earns you only one. Did experience my diamonds disappearing and the timer of keys along with the keys reach zero and not returning. Hope this issue will be resolved. Other than these issues really enjoyed the game, it\'s highly addictive.',
       'I\'ve been playing this game for a few days, so here\'s my review. I enjoy the stories even though they use a lot of archetypes, and I don\'t mind waiting for keys. The biggest issue I have is with the gems and premium choices: not only do the premium choices cost an unreasonably high amount of gems, but every time there are choice options with at least one premium choice, the premium choices are always presented as the better ones. This is less like making my own choices and more like reaffirming my assumption that the premium choices are always the better ones. I\'ve come to the conclusion that I would rather pay once to have this app installed rather than install it for free and pay money for gems just so I could pick the premium choices.',
       'i really love this game. but all of my saved games are gone and u still hasn\'t respond to my message. although i\'ve bought diamonds so many times. can u retrieve my account? \'cause i used the same one but now it\'s just all gone. and for the game i don\'t mind waiting 2 hours to get keys but i don\'t want to always spend my diamonds when it\'s so hard to get. like, we\'re just playing 1 chap and we only get 1 diamond, but we have to spend 20/25/30 to just pick one choice? like, what? i have to play 25 chap first just so i can choose 1 answer? and when i restart a story, we don\'t get a diamonds at all? but we have to spend 1 key to play it again? i think it isn\'t fair. \'cause i played all of the stories, and i need a diamonds but i don\'t get a diamonds when i restart a stories. please, make it easier for us who really loved this game to get diamonds. i really like this game tho. amazing script, amazing scene. i\'m giving u 2 \'cause i really wanted to play this game again but my saved in my account\'s all gone.' ],

       'Definitely not worth it. Was fun at first, but after the updated quests, the game took a serious nosedive in quality. Now you HAVE to beat the opponent in order to get anything, otherwise you\'re out 1000 gold. Before, you would get something just for playing. The new PvP just sucks.',
       'The forced ads are so frequent and annoying. Pvp either freezes and steals your coins or you win and lose coins. Probably over 100,000 coins lost this way. Game has potential and is fun, but company took this fun game and made it not worth playing',
       'Pretty decent game, shame you need to pay gems for the second last ship. The PvP is fun but half the time reduces my gold when I win. Cannot see the devs replying to any messages so unsure if they care',
       'Th game is fun and addicting. Way to many ads!!! Ahhhh My gold counter doesnt always register after endless mode is over. Gives me dble gold if i watch ad but doesnt register after endless battle sometimes. Would gave better review but that sux when it happens. Fix!!!!',
       'its frustrating on the pvp. you get disconnected and automatically lose. and sometimes they put you against someone who has better ships and level. they need to make it even and offer each player the same ships and same power ups at the same time. sometimes I get no power ups until round 3 and my opponent is already on level 7 because he gets better ships and power ups.' ],

IT\'S AMAZING AND I BET YOU\'LL HAVE IT FOR AT LEAST 4 MONTHS!!!',
       'Awesome game controls are just great but the only thing I didn\'t like was that the balls other than the normal one was for real money u guys could make the others balls for diamonds that we get during the gameplay  so we could also actually make use of the diamonds  otherwise the game is awesome👍👍👍',
       'This game is fun but one problem.  My ball keeps randomly rolling off the edge for no reason. Plz fix this then u will get 5 stars.',

     [ 'Someone needs to be fired or at least schooled on currency exchange rates. They offer 2 packs for 5 and 20 then except for rare sales which offer 49 and 79 dollar packs everything is 100 dollars google should step in and pull this game off the google play market for a square enix licensed product they have enough backing to have actual microtransactions not be a game exclusive to rich people who use 100 dollar bills as toilet paper...',
       'Please understand that there is really nothing free about this game except the install. While the gameplay WAS very promising at first, purchaseable bonus packs take any strategy completely out of the game. Now, in addition, each new element of the game that has been released in recent weeks requires cash to unlock. I can only use about half of the games features now. Bummer. If you\'re willing to pay, have a blast with this game. Otherwise leave it alone!',
       'I started this game when it first came out. There were hardly any game advantages and everyone was having fun and on the same playing field. As more and more packages got released into the game it became a pay to win situation. I personally do not think spending $100+ on a phone game is a wise investment. Thus I enjoyed the game by taking advantage of their events and the prizes within the game. However, it has become dominated by people who payed to be the big guy and the little people get absolutely demolished. It has taken the fun out of playing, which really dissapoints me as it was a fun game to play.',
       'This game has potential to be fun but it\'s completely ruined because IT\'S COMPLETELY PAY-TO-WIN which sucked the fun out of the game that I quit. Don\'t get me wrong, Final Fantasy is highly respected RPG franchise because it\'s full of great games in the series. But no this one.  However, I might come back if the game developers make it not as pay-to-win as it is now. Right now, it\'s a complete money bucket!',
       'This game is great and fun, I love spending my time playing this game. One problem though, what is going on with the packages? Why is it every time a package is bought all the packages go from 20 to 100 dollars ? We should be able to buy the 20 dollar packages more than once! Is that fixable? Please cuz i do want to keep playing but 100 dollars is too much.',
       'The game is very addictive and fun to play. Some of the people playing the game are wonderful and fun to game with. Graphics are very good for a on line game played on phone, tablet or computer. The quests are challenging at best. BUT!!! BE WARNED... This game is not for young children as there is explicit language and cut throat people playing the game. After all it is a war game and nothing more. Now down to the nitty-gritty of the game. Yes it\'s free, but that only get you so far before you will need to buy packs in the game to advance and unlock the two new characters. The game quests are designed for people to spend if you want to get ahead fast. Large amounts of  $$$$$$ Cash are needed to play this game. $$$$$$ Personal note, I know people who have spent thousands on this game. Over all the game is great for young adults on up. PG-15' ],

They make so much money and adds and put so many so they annoy you into paying them money for less adds. Greedy.',

I\'m newly paralyzed and I been well adapting to my new life and because my hands dont work like they used to these games kept my mind busy and has helped me.

     [ 'Its a legit fun game to play but...  For me I get streshed because when I need to do it over again then u  streshed by not doing it...    Its still kind of a good game though..  Also on YT thanks for...   !!!! 2 SUBSCRIBERS!!!!  I know its not alot but I am rlly happy and I\'m thankfully to who subscribed to me on YT :)  My name was galaxy DJ but now..  Its AngelPlayz I haven\'t even uploaded any videos yet 😂😂 but thanks for the support!  I might be making new videos about roleplays bloxburg builds and games to enturtain u guys to not be bored!!   I LIKE TACCCCOOOOSSSSSSSSS.....  🍍🍍🍍 .. This is so long lol...   Sorry how this is so long 😂😂😂😂 Well yeah that\'s all I got to say..!!?  Cya peace GUYS🍍🍍',
       'Well, I admit, I\'m addicted to this. The levels are SO FUN, and also quite challenging. Sometimes,yes, I rage, but it wouldn\'t be fun if it was too easy.The animation is sophisticated, the music is AMAZING (my two favorite songs are Clutterfunk and Can\'t Let Go) and they give you a TON of levels for a free trial. I LOVE THIS GAME!!!! Thank you Robtop!!! 🙌😎😍',
       'The whole game is very amazing. Listening to the soundtracks can make you get motivated on playing the certain level until you pass it. The game can sometimes make you rage a little, and the colors can be little bit to neon and flashy for you. The whole point that I think about this game is that it tries to make it very challenging. The colors are beautiful in my opinion. The ads can me sometimes annoying, but you can turn on the airplane more so that they won\'t annoy you too much. Keep up the great work, RobTobGames!   Cøokie',
       'It\'s a real cool game, I do recommend playing this game because not is it only fun bit addictive as well. There are loads of levels so you never get Bored but warning ⚠ the levels do get harder as u go further on. But yeah I do recommend playing this game it\'s super fun, super addictive and i would rate it a 4 star.',
       'Addictive & Fun I think GD Lite is super awesome and addictive. I think it\'s fun because it\'s challenging and there\'s super fun things in GD except hacking because that\'s no fun. Anyways GD is addictive because everyone gets it they beat a level get super happy and boom there into the game. And I\'m super happy because I beat every single level in GD Lite! I hope there could be even more levels!                                                        Challenging levels in GD I think Clutterfunk is the hardest even though I did beat it :D! But the most toghest is       Clubstep, Theary of Everything 2, and the one and only Deadlocked the three demons in GD! GD is awesome!!!!! :D :D :D &lt;3 &lt;3 &lt;3 I love you GD!!!!!! 😎😂',
       'Awesome Game. Been playing for a while, and just downloaded again and got back in to it.  I beat the first few levels, but I get ads mid level.  This basically means dying and having to restart.  It\'s obnoxious,  and gave lost many times to it.' ],

       '"Cusion shot on 8 ball" games are great, woukd be cool if one was created at a lower buy-in though.  I think its currently like 8 million needed to play a bank the 8ball game.  I personally like the No Guidline 9ball games,but would love a cheaper bank the 8 game.    Also, well done on adding the upgrade-able cue sticks.  That alone, i think, has made this game much much better.',
       'I realize y\'all gotta get paid but why make the playing experience for those of us that don\'t pay cash money.  Not allowing a player to select a pocket when shooting the 8 ball and allowing your opponent to shoot and win. I guess I\'m pretty good because nobody has been able to get rid of me playing pool. Instead I seem to get strange lock ups or no response from game. I always seem to lose 100s of thousands. It\'s a pretty good app and I\'ve sent many people to download your app.',
       '8 ball i have been playing it for sometime now and I spend alot of money on the specials.. great specials.. but I noticed whenever I buy coins I don\'t win any games until those coins are over and I\'m only winning recently 2 games maximum in a row and normally my win streak used to be 7 and above... I don\'t know why this is happening but it sucks because it\'s putting me off the game.. it\'s like 8 ball is making sure I\'m losing hence the rate 3',

     [ 'Honestly i really enjoy the game thus far thank you for all the recent updates niantic... but there is one thing that has been bothering me and that is 1v1 with friends and trading... both features were shown in the original trailer... yet again i love the care your giving the game niantic i truly praise it but i would like to know whats happening with my 2 listed thoughts',
       'Please have more legendary raid events with gen 1 and 2 Pokemon for new and returning players who want to collect everything. With regards to using GPS and joystick cheats you guys actually benefit by getting more players from rural areas or dangerous areas playing and spending money. Besides you still have to do all the hard work minus the walking so it technically isn\'t that unfair to others especially since everyone is level 40 these days with legendary Pokemon. The game is already balanced just needs more events. Please consider a premium service to pay for where we can use a joystick in game. We can pay monthly or something so everyone benefits.',
       'thx for niantic that always listened our sugesttion, but i wish we can trade or battling with other player around the world by staying at poke center or else... - and btw you should update the new gym and new pokestop... since when i was on holiday in Indonesia theres not so much pokestop and gym around :( even there are many landmark in there - another suggestion plz maked some item that can be used to summon legendary/raid battle in location that we want, so its much easier  for the communities to do raid battle in specific location',
       'I love pokemon go and always get pulled back into playing it. I\'m still getting use to the updates after not playing for a while and am disapointed in the gyms. While I love being able to use them like pokestops, I wish to recall my pokeon from the gym. I love I a rural area and my poor Vaporeon has been at a gym for 13 days. THIRTEEN. I want my pokemon to come back please.',
       'The game has been majorly revamped and has benefited from it. It\'s so much better to see that content and events are happening more often. Hopefully we\'ll see the first wave of gen 4 by April or May and a nice egg event will happen to get a higher chance of a baby Pokemon from gen 4. Keep up the great work only downside is legendaries. I can\'t get them as not enough people in my area play Pokemon go and I\'m not travelling for a Pokemon. Can we have a legendary event for one week you can get 3* legendary raids? That would make it easier.',
       'I love the game but There are fixes and patches that should have been implemented. That people have been asking for but Niantic won\'t deliver. Ex: There are small bugs everywhere especially in gyms and raids and medals.  They never added trading There is no direct PvP No ingenuity (they could have added Pokemon centers or more pokeball types) Thanks Niantic.' ],

     [ 'Lots of fun and challenging trying to find the best placement for a word to maximize your score.   The one objection I have relates to the dictionary.  When checking a word\'s meaning in the dictionary that any opponent played, and I don\'t recognize,  the dictionary will sometimes say that it is an acceptable word for Words with Friends, but no definition is available at this time.  I believe that when playing a game having to do with vocabulary, no word that does not have a dictionary definition should be allowed!  What determines if it is a legitimate  word if not found in a dictionary?',
       'Have been playing for years and the enhancements keep improving it. This is not Scrabble. It\'s a different game wth its own features. Use those features and enjoy. It\'s hard enough to earn coins to make use of the features a rarity rather than the norm. And Word Strength (always available) is great - you can just accept your lower value word or challenge yourself to work even harder to find a better one. It\'s a great game - especially as once you\'ve had a go, you can leave it for hours (or days!) and only play when you have time. 😊',
       'Good gameplay. I enjoy playing this game. Great for expanding vocabulary. However, too many words that are acceptable without definitions. Should be a way to submit definitions for words, or maybe link with a dictionary app. Additionally, what\'s with the ads after every move? I end up closing game and restarting, it\'s quicker than watching the ads. If they where shorter, I would let them play.',
       'Good game. Only problem there are games that left for 16 + days and you can\'t get rid of them. Even when you nudge the person ... nothing happens. This impacts on starting new games with those who want to play! Please sort this out. Ads too long in version 2. Would rate better if this was sorted.',
       'I really enjoy playing with my friends, just another way to keep in touch even though you\'re miles away! You can also meet and play new folks, as well as play all of the various challenges the game has to offer while you are playing. For example, you earn coins for different words played, difficulty of words played, or words with certain letters. If you enjoy just playing to play or playing for a challenge, this game has it all!',
       'It\'s a lot of fun but... 1. The ads seem to be longer in the latest version, 2. It\'s ridiculous to have words that don\'t mean anything,  3. The lightning race against a team is the best part but there needs to be some good prizes for winning, 4. I love the Solo challenges and I wish they would be scheduled to coincide with the big special events that give about 80 points for a win. I tend to be finished with the Solo event before the big special one begins.' ],

Don\'t worry about getting low scores, because the game starts out slow and gets faster, so you\'ll always be prepared for faster tiles.  There are challenges where you challenge other people in the world!  I never want to give up on this game, its really addicting!',
       'This game is honestly a great time-killer and even has it\'s challenging parts, but from what I\'ve noticed as you get to the higher tier songs they just get slower and slower and are just flat with barely any challenge. I expected more of a challenge with a higher level but now this game is getting horribly boring.',
       'Great game. Played to level 120 and have over 500 gems but then I switched devices. This requires a Facebook account which I did not have. It worked for a little bit until Facebook disabled my account for doing nothing. They need to fix the method they use to sync progress. Now I am level 3 with 17 gems.',
       'I\'m in love with this game. It\'s challenging, you don\'t have to listen to the music to follow the tiles, and it gives you the feeling to be better. I have a suggestion for a new song you can buy for diamonds. Can you add any song from the My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic TV show? Thanks.',
       'I enjoy this game a lot and always loved how it challenged me. It was also fun when me and my friends would fight to see who\'s better but I dislike the update where they added boosters, it doesn\'t seem fair and for me it feel like it loses the title for being relaxing. I don\'t think that adding those futures was a great idea in my opinion and I really miss the old version a lot.',
       'Amazing!  It\'s very time consuming and very musical, interesting, and you get to play with people from around the world.   One of the reasons it\'s so good is that there are no ads. (That is if you click on something that involves an ad) Amazing 5 STARS ALL TIME' ],

U would not believe me, firstly u would die very easily but as u play on then it would be easy to create high score. It also makes your reflexes more faster. The creators have done a great work. And people who are saying there are lots of adds are talking rubbish.  Play it!!!!!',
       'Want to play an ad? Download this game and you\'ll get to experience all the thrills of pop up ads between brief stints of playing the game you thought you downloaded instead of the ads. There is at least two ads per game. Some of the ads go landscape to further increase game play pleasure, X one out and Bam! Bonus round go straight to the app store to see the ad you X\'ed out available for download. Go back and BAM try the X again YOU GO BACK TO THE SAME PLACE. Good times were had played ten games and uninstalled. ADWARE ten millions downloaded how many kept it longer than twenty minutes.',
       'It\'s so fun with all the different types of patterns.im telling you its the best game you will play in your life.When I die it\'s actually quite good, because the last time I did had 100 to spend and when I had passed the next 4 rounds I had 10,000 to spend so you should realy get this game,and Change your life people.Plus the new thing is the star block makes you invincible for a short amount of time for example I was going when I had 93 and I went in 24 star and I Could go through 100 and 123,000 for 1 minute. Anyway great game if you liked my review go onto Episode to see that review. Hope you love the game. Oh and I forgot to tell you a list of all the patterns we have purple, green,rainbow,pink,🍔,💵,🚗 and grey.',

       'Nice concept, nice controls, the problem is that is too much randomnes and less skill. It forces me in corners where I\'m definitely dead or the good boxes are in corners where i can\'t go because of the walls and that also means im dead. Please make it less random or ar least make that if i comith to a path and because of the game i cant chage is, at least dont make the first mistake ista death.',

It would be nice if there was background music of some kind and a glass breaking sound effect when you went through each barrier something pleasing to the ears  Oh and shorter ads would also probably be good.  It could also use more roads and balls and barriers to work towards. I feel like this game has a lot of potential though hope it keeps being updated.',

I would be happy to email the video to you..',
       'The game is a challenge within itself. I normally prefer to play game games that are satisfactory. But this game is very wonderful. As it comprisses of a rolling ball that is running over  an uneven path. So basically there can be competition between the bro who travelled the most distance. It also requires a good solid attention power along with patience.. So i would say its anice game. As of gameplay the is no ending or starting in the game it directly starts and that makes it more interesting. But at the same time also boring. But i would say that if u download this game u will definitely uninstall it after almost a month. Good game and waiting for an update ✌️',

     [ 'I really like the game, but as soon as I played multiplayer my phone crashes. I know it\'s not my phone itself but the program because my phone never crashes to anything. Please fix the multiplayer mode! It\'s really nice but constantly crashes!!! Only because of that, I\'m giving it one star. As soon as it\'s fixed I\'ll be sure to give it 5 star and share it with my friends.',
       '1. The online mode isn\'t letting join a match 2. There should be special moves, like when you fall down, if you press the slide button, you won\'t lose speed (like in Mirrors edge) 3. The courses/levels are too easy, make it more harder',
       'Terrible game. Game play is decent but the levels are to easy as soon as i downloaded  the app I tried multiplayer don\'t work then I tried the last levels and they are to easy this creator did not play this to check how hard it is i am disappointed in the lazy creator 👹',
       'The game is good. I like this game because of the fact it\'s parkour. The fact I don\'t have a life means I can take time on the game,the graphics are great I can clearly see what and how I\'m doing. So the game play is good. I know what controls to use, what to do, and it\'s a good. But I can\'t get over the fact that there is not a lot of color. There is only red and black. So I think they should be color.  Good game otherwise',
       'I was just looking then I found this game I downloaded it and instantly I was attached to it and it is an awesome game all the levels are perfect and it is challenging but not too much and it\'s just an amazing game 😍😘😎😉😎😊☺️😊🙂🤗😉😎😉😍😉',
       'So I turned on the game and I did some steps, maybe 30 passed and I laughed, I turned it off and I uninstalled it.  It is without a doubt hilarious.' ],

I have counted and I don\'t think it is possible for me to have counted incorrectly 20+ times repeatedly.

The 5 day to secret ball never works for me. It resets after 2 days even though I play everyday.  There should be a counter for how many times you switch lanes. Some of the challenges were impossible because you had to switch lanes exactly x amount.  Also I don\'t think you should have challenges that make you avoid getting the coins, because the whole point of the game is to win spheres and lanes...',

I gave it 4 stars however, as sometimes the game takes a while to respond to my touch, and often doesn\'t respond at all. My phone is quite slow though, so I\'m willing to give the game the benefit of the doubt.',

     [ 'I like the mobile version better than the PC version because the touch screen works better than the mouse. I also love the food machine you can get for 12 diamonds. It\'s pricey but we\'ll worth the purchase. I kinda wish the pace of customers was a little bit slower so I had more time to prepare the food. I do wish however that I didn\'t need so many gems to upgrade every little thing. Or if I do need gems then maybe they could be easier to get instead of only getting 5 every time you level up. So, decrease the pace of customers and make the gems easier to get',
       'Love this game. Easy to play. My daughter and her partner both downloaded after playing mine.  When I first downloaded the game I didn\'t need to have the internet on. Don\'t know what happened but I know have to be on the internet to start the game but can then turn the internet off. Otherwise happy with it. So many restaurants to buy. And you can get ahead with the casino and keep playing everyday to get more money and gems. Thumbs up from me.',
       'This game is an amazing way to pass the time! I love all the upgrades and different levels, especially the events. The game gets more challenging as you go along, and the events I previoisly mentioned make it just that much better. My only complaint is how hard it is to get the special currency of the game, being diamonds. Other than that, it is a great game overall and I am looking forward to future updates.',
       'I Love Everything About This Game. I Can Upgrade Everything and Get Far. I Save Soooooo Much Money And I Can Learn Quickly How To Cook & Level Up Very Fast. Before I Switched Over To A New Phone Plan I Realized A Very Awesome Little Technique They Have. If You Have A Connected Account No Matter What Phone You Get Your Levels Will Be Stored & Saved. I Was So Shocked. Overall I Love This Game. Most Definitely Will Recommend.',
       'It would be nice for updated casino with new slot machine games and also some new restaurants.  Last one was quite sometime ago?  Are you still actively developing the game or you called it quits like some other games I had to uninstall because there was nothing left to do in them.  Just curious.....',
       'This game is a bit boring at first since it is really hard to serve your burgers because they take ages to cook.  I, after 1 day,  got totally addicted to it as it gets really fun and especially when it lets you purchase the automatic cooker for just 10 gems it is easy and cool! You will see what I mean when you hopefully download the app as I would definitely recommend it! Thank you for making a fun, addictive app that I enjoy. 😄' ],

     [ 'Amazing game... Loved it...😍 The tunes are AWESOME!!!  And Bryan swag zone At first even I thought that But... It is a maze so it\'ll obviously be twisted... (No Hate) It is actually that you should click maybe after the third or fourth turn to get it right... Even I took time to understand that So it\'s okay 😊',
       'This is by far my favourite mobile game to date. Loads of fun and not covered with ads like every other game out there (while there is a few this one isn\'t as bad). My only complaint is the new continuation thing. That wasn\'t there but now it\'s forced me to watch ads even though I played to remove ads.',
       'Seems like controls tend to be problematic, and synchronisation has to be adjusted for every song. However the game is wonderful, precise, compelling and worth spending time on! Everything is well thought, new levels and lines are frequently added. So far my favourite app ever, looking forward to playing some new levels and the match option.',
       'I really wish you guys didn\'t update it. It truthfully bugs me that I can\'t listen to the full song on the menu anymore. The songs are absolutely amazing and the game is very addictive. I hope you will update the game again so that we can just sit and listen to these master pieces if we wanted. Thanks for an awesome game!',
       'It\'s an amazing game. Sure I run around my bedroom screening every time I fail next to the end.... but there is something about this game that makes you happy. Is it the music? Maybe. Is it the back ground and the way it moves?possibly. It\'s all of those things plus more   In a nut shell I really really really really really really really really really love this game :p',
       'Good songs. That\'s about it. The hitbox detection and lag spikes are horrific, the checkpoint system is a blatant cash grab, and what annoys the most is that the timing of music+taps (the core mechanic of the game) is completely broken. It is significantly easier to play the game with audio off, so that you don\'t get distracted by the miss timed turns. Doesn\'t even fulfill it\'s most basic selling point. Atrocious.' ],

     [ 'Sooooooo addicting ,I love this game so fun,  relaxing and has great music. I can\'t stop playing. So awesome,they should make more word searches or word crosses like these kind of games. All though  you have to pay for some parts of the game but out of all the games I have ever played this on is #1😍😂😃',
       'My favorite word game, but I rated it only 4 stars because they repeat some of the puzzle groups as you progress through the game. I have gone through the Ocean group of puzzles at least twice now. With all the words in the English language, there is no reason for this. Also, there are many words, most quite common, that are not accepted.',
       'This is 1 of the word games I like to play that gives you coins for each extra word as you end each game level instead of having to build up to a certain number before you get the coins. I also love the scapes. . . They bring back memories from my youth and childhood.',
       'I love this game! It\'s a real challenge and better than the normal ones because of the backgrounds and how it\'s a crossword. You could add an online player vs player thing too. I love the daily challenges. Maybe add something to win instead of coins? If you love a good daily challenge defiantly get the game!! 😊',
       'Game itself is good but to have an advert appear everytime you get to the next level is a bit much. It\'s always the same adverts and it\'s not easy to close the advert. It directs you to playstore to install the app that is being advertised.  I know you need to make money for making this app but the ads are spoiling what was once nice to play.

     [ 'wow ! why is this game so good!! addicting I got a problem ! to many ads! I under stands u need money but you should put purchases so u get some more money !! and also I want to have new characters and themes that will be cool course I nearly got all but I haven\'t! also change rating to pegi 3 I know there\'s the characters can be a vampire but srsly IT\'S NOT SCARY what is with wthat!  sorry it\'s long but thanks for taking time and reading bye!😀😀😀😁😁😁',
       'Very very addictive pass time. Only a lil disappointed with the adds popping out every now and than. I know its a free app and adds are inevitable but try reducing the number of time it should appear not after each and every round.',
       'It\'s a very good game! I got my boyfriend hooked on it, but my problem with it is, sometimes when I start up the app it sits on the beginning stage of the app?? Like when am I going to be able to play again? Was just updated? So I\'m going to have to delete it and start it all over and re gain my high score??',
       'So when I first downloaded it I thought it was going to be really good and following to the comments, it is also addictive. The only issue is, it laggs when you get further up the tower. Please fix this issue and if you do, five stars from me! :)',
       'Game consistently crashes when it fails to load an advert (around 4/6 times a session before I give up) and the amount of adverts is ridiculous. I understand you need to make money, but having a non-optional advert after every attempt despite declining the \'second life\' advert is over the top.',
       'This adorable & addictive game is very fun to play at any time of the day! It is definitely a close competitor of the infamous"Candy Crush" trend. For such a simple concept, it never ceases to amaze me; especially since I can\'t seem to get a long enough winning streak to increase my stack count. I admit, I suck at this game... Yet I can\'t stop playing it! 4/5 stars for me. Loses a star for excessive ads and lagging during the game.' ],

     [ 'The game is good to play. But even though you have guessed the word it doesn\'t submit until you\'ve spent coins to get hints. This happens after every 3/4 levels. After it happened for the sixth to seventh time, I started making a note of what words I tried. Not good, needs fixing ASAP. Luckily for me, I\'m not one to waste money buying coins.',
       'Should be able to spell words no matter how many letters are only recommend. Would\'ve had a lot more coins if that wasn\'t such a limiting factor. Definitions should be added after word is found in case user wants to know what he/she spelled. At least, I want to know what the definition is. That way, I am learning new words. Enhancing my vocabulary as what this app was created/designed for. Right? Right?',
       'Easy but good at least rn. Im just begining. Sometimes it doesnt accept some words but its great to play to kill time. The adds arent bad and they\'re pretty short. Great game for entirr family! The game does get tougher as you go one. I like the fact that you can change the theme as well! Its nice that you don\'t have to look at the same thing over and over. It seems some boards are really easy and others are extremely difficult but a great game!!',
       'Really enjoyed the game. Fun to play, keep coming back, sometimes letters are too close together and it is hard to select the ones you want without others getting in the way. The present doesn\'t ever give me above 39 coins. It\'s either rigged or I am very unlucky.',
       'This game could be a lot of fun, except that there are many words in the English language that this game does not recognize and accept. There are many, many words that should be given as extra credit, but this game does not acknowledge that they are even words. Please, expand your knowledge base and change the game so that it accepts ALL words as extra words. Also, you do accept some "things" as words that ARE NOT words, such as abbreviations and contractions.  Example:  \'etc\' and \'its\' are NOT words. If you do a little research and update the game, then I will come back and give you 5 stars.',

     [ 'Great game. Challenging, fun, and addictive lol. I\'m 32 and play this often so it\'s not just for kids . Give it a try it\'s very satisfying . Just wished you could add friends ... People that play whom you may not know so we all could help each other. That would make it more interactive and a lot more fun. No one I know plays so it would have to be other fellow fishermen 😉',
       'Fantastic game! It\'s great fun decorating the aqariums and the game board is very clear. The recent move of the boosters to the right hand side of the screen was a VERY bad decision, as I have accidentally used them when my hand has brushed against them - this has happened many times already. A good addition would be a marker indicating a purchased item.',
       'Because you only get 5 lives and you make some levels with too few moves. It would be nice if you could interact more with your fish and tanks. The whole point of beating levels is to build up your tanks...but you can\'t do anything with them while waiting for lives. It would be a fantastic game if there was more to do within the tanks!',
       'I Loooove Fishdom!!!😁 I\'m absolutely addicted to this wonderfully fun & challenging game. The graphics are very cute & entertaining. The only issue i have is that I\'m up in levels 180+ & there\'s just NO way to make the amount of coins to purchase ALL the decos/plants i earn. Most are priced too high.',
       'I love this game, its very challenging. The only thing I don\'t like is that your aquariums end up way overcrowded with stuff before you can move to the next aquarium. Of course you can move on to the next one as soon as its unlocked, but I won\'t move on until I have all 3 stars. So honestly, I guess this is just my issue. I probably should have given it 5 stars, because my issue is the only reason I didn\'t.',
       'So far I like it. But not on a very high level well see how this progresses. Well now I\'m on a level that I keep losing  by one  or ten mainly bcuz all the graphics  are stationed in the exact space so. And while it\'s true u don\'t need WiFi to play u do need it for ur daily prize which u really need.' ],

     [ 'I think this game is brilliant. An absolute pleasure to play and I never get bored. This game should be voted one of the best games ever. Obviously I like other games but this is a whole different story. I just wanted to say please make it so u can join lower levels friends? I can\'t join my sister and were only five levels apart.',
       'Ok It said Hey wanna play? Update your game..... Then when I come to update it it said it\'s updated AND IT IS..Pg2d u r bassically restricting me from playing the multiplayer battles. re u serious rn? Icant play cause i have to update the game when i already did.... Bassically waist of my money to buy new weopons when i cant use them.',
       'This game is the best I have ever played on a phone tons of maps, game modes, hundreds of guns, different tools, gear, and lots of skins. There is just so many things you can do. I also like it because it is a challenge something I would play. That\'s why I rated this game 5 stars.',
       'It\'s fun because I  git to play with school friends, and the gaming is amazing so keep up the good work! But I hate the new update with levels to upgrade you wepons! On upgrade costs more than the gun! Not   every one in the game is rich you know!',
       'This game is great! Even though you have to constantly farm for wins, but it does pay off. I\'m a level 12 in Ruby rank with 👌 guns. I used to have a candy cane baton that killed instantly upon impact, but it\'s not as effective against gold armor. R. I. P. Strategy',
       'I really like it. It\'s fun and entertaining, a highly suggested game in my opinion. Although i would like it if the sandbox mini game had more maps, and more freedom to choose those maps as well. It would also be very appreciated if we could play games with lower leveled players because i really wanna play co-op games with my friend, but she just started the game and it says insufficient levels. It would also be nice if the options of private servers were back in sandbox and you could choose what teams you wanna join in team fight. But otherwise, it\'s really great and easy to play 😄' ],

It\'s almost impossible to play this hame st a consistent frame rate. Maybe add an ability to downscale the resolution or tone down the animations?  Edit: after the new update they fixed it. The game runs buttery smooth',

Why play mini games for Golden Apples when you could just watch ads for Golden Apples since they let you watch infinite ads. Why play Classic, Zen or Arcade for Starfruit when you could just watch ads.',

     [ 'This is all I needed: another Criminal Case game to take up my free time! I love the whole four of them. The the hidden objects tease my brain to no end. Each game  is intriguing with an original story line. I do have my favorite crime scenes,  and plenty of friends(all over the world) whom play as often as they can too!',
       'It would be nice if you level up and get full energy but your energy had some if not all left before you got it restored that you just increased by the full amount, the way it is now I lose energy when levelling up because it doesnt add any more to the 110 that is standard. I dont think it is fair to those of us who play daily. I never know when my pet will find that last batch of XP and cause the level up to happen. If I am over the 110 already, I don\'t even see the new energy. Some concessions need to be made for this. I love the game though, it is fun and challenging.',
       'I love this game. I have all of the criminal case games & love them all. The only things that I don\'t like is that when when ur energy gets refilled, it only adds to what u have, instead of adding an extra 110 to what u have. The other thing is that u can\'t buy none of the hamburgers, orange juice, chips or anything with ur tokens',
       'Love Criminal Case and a True Fan!! One thing I think should change is that whatever score you have when you level up, the 110 should be added to it. We deserve it  because we Earned it and the only reward we get is to share juice with other players. Give us a Happy Meal and 110 pts.!!',
       '4th instalment of the Criminal Case games. I love playing them all excellent time wasters intriguing story lines. I\'m well & truly hooked on the whole series. Gainsborough, Pacific Bay, Save The World & now this Mysteries Of The Past........ all brilliant',
       'I was over the moon when they put Mysteries of the past on. I hope they can do the same with The conspiracy as well. All 4 games are a must have. You\'ll never find another game like these. I love playing them because they\'re brilliant & addictive, I hope they continue to make more.' ],

     [ 'I\'m 11 and i love it so much.I have some Ideas for a toca kitchen 3. You can be able to make sandwiches and soups or stews. And more ingredients, more people. And you could add mustard and mayonnaise. Wait Maybe you could make tacos and weird ones. These are just  suggestions but I would love to see some of these suggestions. You would call it Toca Kitchen 3, with a nice logo. I did like toca kitchen 1 & 2. It is fun to play and food, and when we mess up to see how the people eating the food react. Bye.',
       'I want YOU to read this Toca Boca I love it! But I have to ask, Why is there bread if you can\'t make a sandwich? Also can you make there a way to make soup? I really like your games but I am only 10,how do you expect me to pay for the games. At make 5 free like this!',
       'I like how I can give the guests disgusting drinks and food a see and hear their really funny reaction! Once I gave the girl a drink that had water,and all the spices and all of that, and she was like, the funniest reaction!😆😆 I also like how  there are different cooking supplies and spices and utensils! Keep up the good work! And make sure to make more today games free! Because then everyone will love you!',
       'Awesome! You Can choose your pick. I am only using 9 and I love this. It is really interesting what they like and what they dislike. Thanks for making this , Toca Boca! I\'m sure 7 year olds would be giggling with laughter. Keep up the good work! Best regards, -Bella on MSP',
       'I LOVE this app! And I\'m so glad it\'s free! Everyone is like \'it\'s the same thing over and over again\' but they\'re not actually getting into this game. They\'re are tons of different options to choose from and like Toca Boca says cook it your way. I LOVE TOCA BOCA!!!',
       'I\'m giving a 5 star rating, not cuz I like this game but because I want you to make all your games free or at least the toca life:city or vacation. Please I always wanted that game because It looks really fun and it must be. You probably won\'t make them free but if you can, make toca life city free at least' ],

     [ 'This game was great until about 5 days ago, that is when it started to take 4 to 5 minutes loading time for each game mode to start. Now my attention span prevents me from waiting that long to play one game. What happened game developers?.... !!UPDATE!! Okay it must have just been the servers. Because they\'re back up and running at 32 seconds loading time for a war. This game is great. I can dig it can you dig it',
       'They have fine a great job with this game. The dynamics, the playability, the graphics, and it feels as if you could never stop growing. Every bot is beast with a certain load out and play style.  Update! After playing for over 3 years, and over many different platforms this game rocks. It\'s definitely not the mech its the pilot kinda game. The balance is good so if you spend money and level quickly you\'ll be placed on your mechs rating(mech level + weapon level) so take your time and learn some tactics. Every gun has its purpose but it takes a good pilot to make them work.',
       'Game is designed to milk money out of its players. Fun to play. But $200 for a pretend robot or $100 for a single gun. Lower prices. You might be shocked more people can afford 20 than 200......reply- you think giving someone 15 pieces of a random bot that takes 2 games to earn if you place first out of the 10000 you need. Only real option they give is purchas. Don\'t be fooled. This is a pay to win game.',
       'A great game that brings back the old Mech warrior days. One of the few good theme fps shooters on this platform that is "FREE". You can pay to win but it will cost you alot. Investing afew tens to smoother the growth? But you can still have plenty of fun without spending a dime.  Until it slowly draws you in deeper.....',
       'I like how the game has gotten better over past year in many ways.. But could you guys quit making the puzzle peice stuff to get newest goodies? I get you added lots of cool ways to get extras that\'s cool and all.. But who wants 7 puzzle pieces out of 7,000? Not worth the effort. Keep it gold and silver guys!!',
       'Game plays fine. No ability to choose mode is a major letdown. I did the $20 test to see if you can actually buy anything valuable. The answer is no. The game is geared towards the have money people. Update 2/23/2018  The queing is under 10 seconds. After Lunar New Year update you can earn upgrades better.  Discounts on purchase items is better.' ],

     [ '👇Earn.Free.Money👇 înstaII \'VEARN\' App Entet (RERA) to Start Earnings So far so good. Fun way to get Money. Won\'t make you rich but the extra cash is helpful. It\'s also the best exchange rate on points. uno points equals cs instead of like some of the others where it takes uno points to reach cs etc....Also, TOYOCASH App very reliable in paying you when you redeem to Giftz. You can choose assorted giftcards as payment or transfer to waIIet for cash. Your choice. I love these guys thanks for adding some fun to my day.',
       'Fun, addictive, progressively challenging....this game has it all. I especially appreciate the flawless performance with no lag time. I also paid for the ads to be removed... totally worth it!  There are some inconsistencies with words being accepted in some levels but not others....not an issue for me though. It adds to the challenge.  I love the beautiful background pictures!  Best word game ever! I just need more levels now :)',
       'Great game, fair balance of ads. Only thing it needs to mix all the songs thru all levels, as the single song while does hold up to repeat play, eventually gets repetitive. Also need better dictionary because I often play real words and it doesn\'t count them which stinks.',
       'Okay, enjoying playing the game but seems that there are no rules! Sometimes proper nouns are okay sometimes not, words used in previous rounds suddenly aren\'t allowed, etc., plurals are a lottery and perfectly good words are just not accepted and few non-words are allowed. Seems a bit arbitrary at times.',
       'Its fun but when you get to like level 85 it gets really really difficult. The only way you can pass if is if you know your words very very well. Some times i have ask my mom to help me because it so hard.',
       'I love it. There\'s only two problems. When you\'re on a streak and you accidentally hold a letter and don\'t make a word you lose your streak, even if you don\'t try to make a word. As well as that, the WORST part of the game is the notifications that constantly pop up even if you turn them off. Seriously might be the reason I uninstall the app.' ],

You should be matched on games played not trophies. Otherwise the good players who go up the trophies quickly always play people with better clubs. The game goes easy on you if you\'re not good at it which defeats the point of getting good',

I don\'t know why they do this  horrible play on me I spend more than 100 of Dollars to purchase chest and other stuffs to become great player but they turn against my happiness in this wonderful game I love so much, Oh well no more buy chest this time no matter what..

     [ 'This  was really  fun! Starts off easy but gets harder, not near the ads of the  other games I have played. Takes extra words, hints are reasonable,  earning money is reasonable.  So far the best of the word connects !! Really happy with this game, will add to my phone  and get rid of the other word connect games that seem to have ad, after ad not to mention the high amount for hints! There is one reason I didn\'t  give it a 5, because some of the ads get stuck and you can\'t  exit,  overall  4.8!',
       'Not a bad time killer - quick paced and not too taxing on the brain. I wish it had a more comprehensive dictionary so you would still get bonus points for valid words like \'cad.\' No matter - still basically a four star, though almost three for the number of ads.',
       'The game isn\'t bad if you like word puzzles. My dislike comes from the fact that I have push notifications for this app turned off, but it somehow continues to manage to send them. It also keeps poor track of your coins. Good time killer.',
       'Child-friendly! And, as an adult? I love how am yet to see an advertisement. 😊  Unlike other word games like Word Connect, it also lets you find and play words that are not necessarily those found on the board, storing it in an "Extra" slot, which generates added points to your score, rather than telling you to choose the word that\'s only on the board.  ADDENDUM: After reading the comments, it appears there may be ads after all. Am yet to see any though. Perhaps because am still in a lower level.',
       'Game is fun. But giving me pop ups to bring me back to the game while it\'s not open is a nono. Especially when it takes up half the screen. I\'d give 5 stars cause i had fun playong this, but this one thing is annoying. Especially with the amount of ads, it shows you just wanna push people to keep playing for that ad revenue. Won\'t be downloading any of your games after i delete this now.',
       'This is one of the best word games I have ever, when running into a really tough spot not immediately uninstalled. This is a GREAT AND CHALLENGING GAME!!! It really makes you think and it keeps your brain thinking and actively. I love it and will keep it. I am 70 yrs old and just got this game a couple weeks ago and at almost level 300.. This is a keeper!!' ],

     [ 'The game in itself is in no way a Final Fantasy Game, apart from containing many of the series favorite characters. It is however a very enjoyable and addictive game, keeping you returning for just one more battle.  I haven\'t found any bugs so far, works perfect but does require a constant internet connection.',
       'Good game. Lots of characters to choose from and they are obtainable for FREE. Which is different from FFBE. The only problem im having is its hard to get specific character weapons for each character in story. Specifically the 25 gear draw. I\'ve been obtaining only 3-4 of the 25 story character weapons and I still don\'t have the weapon I\'m looking for. Also it\'ll be hard to obtain the same copy of the weapon to limit break it. And it Cost a lot of gems just to obtain one. Hopefully the game will add higher chance and still have the opportunity to get those weapons since its expiring tomorrow.',
       'Loved the game from when I downloaded it and played the hell out of it none stop for days pretty much. However, after doing the latest update today, the game has lost all functionality and is unable to even begin. I\'ve attempted to load it several times, and have even uninstalled it and then reinstalled it multiple times but it still won\'t work. Love the game, its one of the best games on the app store but I\'m pretty much furious now that the game just won\'t work for me any more and I\'m not the only one this has happened to.',
       'For a phone game this has been the first one to actually grab me in a really long time. It\'s a great time killer it\'s super addictive and I even find myself stopping to focus on it during some of the harder fights. Everything\'s very rewarding and while I wish that the microtransactions were a lot cheaper all in all it\'s a really good game.',
       ':( I was excited but after downloading was met with a black glitchy screen. Uninstalled and reinstalled twice no luck. Gonna wait a few days and try again. Not hating on the game at all, just gonna wait a bit.  EDIT: Now that it has been patched it works perfectly, I love this game. Thanks you so much.',
       'FF has been my ish since day 1. For the kind of game this is (definitely not like FF9), it\'s a great game to pass the time. Now my only suggestion is to make the dialogue more engaging and interesting because I mostly skip them because it seems geared towards a 5th grader and not for adults who love FF.' ],

     [ 'I really like this game, kind of wish the progression system was a bit quicker though, other than that, the tight controls, open world and variety of creatures you can eat make it a solid game. The special sharks look really cool, and I even considered buying one until I saw the 50$ price tag.   On a side note, what\'s the difference between this app and the Hungry Shark World?',
       'i would rate 5 stars... but.. something with the cloud save broke, i used to have the megalodon, without any cheats.. but now i have the mako. could you fix this somehow? And do i email the support team? Im not good with all the emailing stuff.',
       'I thought it was SUPER DUPER AMAZING. Keep that game like this and don\'t change it. But whenever I would eat like a lot, then I don\'t get bigger and it said the more you eat the more bigger you get. So I think you should make that better. If u wouldn\'t have done that then I would be impressed by the game.',
       'Amazing game. I completed this game in 48 minutes Hahaha! Because I used luckypatcher :) I downloaded the luckypatcher in Googlechrome But it can harm your Device..... And the last shark is Moby dick His baby is as big as Megalodon.',
       'The is the most intense game ever.When you think you\'ve got it ,it\'s gone. Can\'t figure out how to boost. Controls aren\'t the best.Rhis game could improve. Oth er than that it\'s fine I guess.Too many pop up ads. Really frustrating. I want to play the game not look at ads. Sometimes  you can\'t back out of the ad.',
       'My apologies for the negative review lately. But to be honest, I have to use VPN just to log-in in Google Play and enable cloud sync or else, I wouldn\'t be able to sync my progress. Just a little request, can you make the gameplay smoother for lower end devices, such as devices with 1GB RAM? It lags frequently during gameplay. Thanks a lot!' ],

     [ 'I like this game a lot. There was a problem with one particular ad causing the game to have to be restarted, but they seem to have gotten rid of it.  Developer responded to my unhappiness.  Isn\'t that a good Developer? I think so.  Their game, Idle Factory Tycoon is really good also.',
       'I usually don\'t write reviews but I\'ll make an exception this time. I really hate when there aren\'t videos available I\'ve checked the settings recently and I was not connected to Google for some reason. I did not disconnect myself, why the game disconnect me from Google Play Store I\'m very disappointed.',
       'There is a bug with Mine 3 on the Mainland. At sharft number 23 it stops taking the crystals but it shows the action of taking them. The total does not drop down to 0 and it keeps adding to the total. Could you please fix that bug. Really enjoying this game too.',
       'Great game until you hit an ucloseable ad, or ads dont load.  also, the legendary chest is a rip off. I have bought 4 and they say 50% chance of legemdary item.  Nope, the only 1 I have gotten came from a common.  So spend your premium currency on something more productive.',
       'The game doesn\'t keep cloud saved data.  Had this game linked to Google and Facebook. My phone broke and it took me awhile to get a new one and now that I\'m on my new phone went to download this game and I\'m having to start all over.  Thanks for all those months deleted. Won\'t be playing this again.',
       'Game is fun but after opening 3 mines and prestiged 1, I mean it\'s always the same. They don\'t give tool for kickstarting mines when you start over. Its kind of boring to start over thousand times. So game is fun but gets boring quickly to me.' ],

And some items I\'ve purchased don\'t work it gives a message saying they couldn\'t find it in the warehouse. But the game never gave me my gems back and of money. NEED TO FIX IT',
       'I love this game!! "it helps a lot" with my shopping addiction because I feel like I\'m buying real merchandise. I really enjoy the updates and how you guys added more room to be designed!!!! Also the 2d & 3d option to view products is awesome!! and if your  studying for interior design this is the app for you! I love the voting of others designs, you get to view everyone creativity. I really love how you guys never ask for an rating....like some apps by the 1st go you get popups please rate our app you guys never asked for an rating I choose to. Thanks for getting me addicted :))',
       'I really love this game. I love voting and seeing what other have also come up with. I love that it is really world design where you can actually shop for pieces and not cartoon rubbish. However, I have had a number of issues where the game has had to restart and have even lost diamonds and cash after trying to collecting daily rewards when it re starts, watching endless adds and not receiving rewards for them or downloading other useless games I have no interest in and actually playing them to generate rewards and not receiving them either. These are my only issues with the game. Other than these it would be five stars.',
       'Great application. Very enjoyable. Only complaint wish app had more international design furniture to match the themes and settings. Also need to fix the bug so that the design loading screen appears.  This is the only app that I have to reset my tablet to get my results, since the last update I have had this issue. I have made an inquiry adressing this issue and it still has not been fixed. I have changed my rating because of this issue, once it has been addressed and fixed I may change my opinion.',
       'Entertaining, enjoyable and inspiring! Brings out  your creativity in utilizing your available resources and in maximizing your limited funds. The game makes you travel around the globe.  Hope to seeing homes from less popular countries. Sad to note that there are times that free diamonds don\'t add up after watching the videos and there are items not found in the warehouse.',
       'I really love this game! It surely brings out my passion in interior designing, nourish my mind as i see others works, getting inspired also to continue want i really love in life, which is designing/art. And it does help me to chill or relax whenever im depressed bcoz it makes me think what to design, and helps me get out of the stress that life brings. It indeed help me with my mental and emotional instability. 5 stars for this! Number 1 app for me. Never failed my expectations. LOVE IT!' ],

     [ 'Yes this is addictive, yes it\'s fun, and it\'s great because you can spend 12 seconds or 12 minutes on it and still get the same amount of enjoyment. BUT, and this is a very big but, this game is a HUGE drain on your battery. And no, I don\'t have an iPhone - I have a proper phone - a Sony XZ Pro. So it\'s not the weedy battery. No game I have ever played drains the battery away as fast as this game does, so it\'s clearly an issue that I wish they could fix.',
       'Way way WAYYY too laggy. It\'s an easy casual game though. I wouldn\'t say it\'s "fun" but it does pass the time and make you want to achieve the little goals. Only goal, make more money in game. That\'s it and you achieve that by not even playing the game so there\'s no challenge whatsoever. Uninstalled after first day reaching about 500 Trillion and force closing 100 times.',
       'This game is enjoyable, but like many have said, it drains battery life. Moreover, it hangs too long when switching planets. I suspect, like many areas of technology, performance testing new updates with older devices is not even a consideration. If it runs smooth on the latest and greatest then it is ready to ship.  Like many mobile games this is a casino. It\'s main existence is to make money. I do not have a problem with this so much, but the events give rewards based on leaderboards. Unfortunately, they are pay to win. You are bombarded with options to pay cash. Making the top charts without spending money is not likely to happen.  This game is a time and battery killer, so keep you charger close by.',
       'It\'s okay, but now that I think about it, it really takes up your free time and battery, to me it is eh no use but adddictive! If I had a choice to choose between a milla-seccond or a minute, I would choose a milla-seccond but technichly, you could just go offline while you are waiting. Cool game! 3 stars.',
       'Earth dollar = moon dollar.. the exchange rate is 1:1 when converting to the megabuck not like you grinded to jus redo earth play in the moon or anything. Events are unfairly calculated as well. If you do not pay $$$ you will not tier above 7-8 tiered rewards, if that even.  Youd think in a capitalist game you would be allowed to have choice over portrait lock. But the game overrides system settings I guess.  Game lags hard when it cant figure out portrait or not.',
       'You should be connected to facebook. So when people change from iPhone to android, we can keep our levels. I just had to restart again and I had 6800 lemons and not much longer to complete the game. What an accomplishment I\'m going to try to receive this time' ],

Then they added the new global challenges.This game just keeps growing, not like many of the other games that just stays the same..you will be amazed. Now they added Global challenges, with new head gear...like I said this game keeps growing...it runs so smooth and the graphics are awesome. If you haven\'t tried it. Do it. If you have come back and be amazed at the changes.',
       'Thx for updating Frozen Shadows. Blazing Sands still needs work. Too much water, not enough Sand. Needs a "slide," I recommend sand surfing. The canyons also get boring. The variations between it and the other levels don\'t compare, especially for the gem cost to play it. Still, fun and relaxing, and stays fun. 4/5.',
       'Nice, good, adventure game.but some times your team irritating who one completed thirteen level they will easily get diamond  your giving master challenge ( now the challenge Chinese New year )who one complete your giving thirty diamond only.this offer will useful only for entry level gamers. Most of players finished fourteen level so they no need diamonds.so think about genius players.',
       'I love all the graphics it\'s a bit like the        piano tiles it test\'s your fast skills but except it is temple run 2 love it. Except for the controls though cause sometimes if i turn it to right it goes to left and sometimes it bumps into the tree same to the left you need to fix the controls more.',
       'It\'s my favorite app. I love it a lot. My only issue is that it doesn\'t quite accurately update my stats especially my highest score without using a \'save me,\' longest run, most coins & gems. I would really like the developers to look into that but otherwise it\'s a brilliant game.',
       'I love this game, very addicting. And I love that it has the daily, weekly and global challenges. As well as objectives and the daily chest challenges. Lots of things to work for and win. Makes the game more fun. Plus, so far, I haven\'t come across anything that I\'ve had to spend money on in order to advance in the game' ],

     [ 'Pretty good design, but there is a cheater mode which tells you when one is wrong even if it\'s not apparent. So the fastest times are always really fast even for the hard ones. Also the ad bar is right below the numbers so you accidentally hit it when you play. Pretty sure that\'s intentional to get extra clicks, but super annoying.',
       'having lots of fun with the game, especially the daily challenges. But  ads that cannot be skipped pops up way too often, and its quite irritating. Also it would b good if u can ad d something like automatically mark (diff cotour, shade out) the numbers thats already been fully filled so we dont have to check it manually.',
       'My wife and I play this game like an old couple as we wait for our son to sleep, sure enough - we all doze off!  This game makes the brain go, sometimes my brain goes so hard that smoke comes out my ears.  Beautiful. Thank you for the gift of this game, we\'ve shared about the light it brings into our lives.   That\'s a good ending.',
       'It\'s great love the daily challenges. Placing the numbers isn\'t intuitive for me, I like to select the number I want to work on then place it down so I often overwrite my number when I accidently attempt this. Even still its honestly the best sudoku app that I\'ve used',
       'I like this very much. I don\'t mind the ads in the game but the reason I gave it only 2 stars are all the loud ads in between the games. Unbelievably annoying. Specially when you get one in the middle of the night on the long distance bus.',
       'The game in itself isn\'t bad but I\'ve completed a puzzle in 10 minutes and for the past half an hour I don\'t know what to do next, does it pop up on the screen \'You have finished\' or do we just move on? I\'ve been looking for any place that I\'ve gone wrong but I haven\'t found any' ],

       'It\'s honestly a pretty good game, it\'s fun, even though there\'s no real end goal and a lack of side quests. Although many improvements can be made to the game, the worst part is the ads, it\'s really bad, and it\'s insulting as a player that they try to milk this much out of us. You have constant random ads that take over your game at any moment. 5 ads per chest you craft to unlock each slot, ads when you switch to the map, floating treasure chests that require ads to open, even more pointless ads at every crafting bench, and the list goes on. I would gladly even pay to play an ad free version, but this is just ridiculous.',

Sure, you can pay for more coins and items to level up quicker - but you can enjoy the game without paying anything. I get raided too but on a fairly acceptable basis. I love this game. Only thing is, I don\'t like my non-responsive faction members and I\'m worried once I leave my faction I couldn\'t join another one. Ah well. That being said, 5 stars for the game.',
       'Game is really good! Currently level 10 & I am doing pretty good. (For what I think) It\'s a fun game to play you can get free coins which makes it more fun and fair for players that can\'t pay for anything, except patience. I do wish it\'ll be easier to level up characters. But it\'s pretty easy. Just so difficult to get more characters to pay for level ups.',
       'This game is a treasure! It has kept me entertained for about 1 year and a half so far! I love the story parts and maps and I want to congratulate the developers! Good job, Nice graphics, Great game. Although, I lost my save file because this game doesn\'t make any easy whatsoever to load save files. Please fix that! Thanks!',
       'Awesome game based on the comics. The only set back is that I can\'t seem to be able to download the content for the third chapter on the story map. It goes so far into the download and then stops.   I have already uninstalled and reinstalled the game three times. And I have even deleted unused/unwanted files from my phone to free up some extra space, and it hasn\'t made any difference.   I don\'t know what else I can do.',

     [ 'Tokens take too long to refill. Level up gives a few coins, why not a token refill? Tournament champion gets 4 tokens. 7 tokens for a day? Cheapskates! When do you want us to play, every 5 days? So cheap in giving prizes, guessing you want us to buy eh? I\'ll give myself a few weeks playing this game and am out. No daily prize wheel, just a daily "less than 20 coins" reward. Sooooooo cheap!',
       'It\'s just ok.  Hard to see your entire hand at times and some of the rules are different than the actual UNO game itself. When I contacted this apps tech support, they sounded as if they could care less and said they will not be making any changes to the game.  So I play until they want me to buy credits then I stop.  When they give me more free credits I play again.  I like the game UNO, just not this one so much.  Why do I still play?  Hmmm, that\'s a good question.',
       'Greatest game ever~~¤mean it.  The Updated game even better.  Need to be easier to play with Friends that you JUST made ~~maybe REPLAY!!!  😬 😲 😠 😐 😭  Friends where are you? Great for tablets.   I am UNO happy . Happy New years  .Oh don\'t terminate the game unless you just have to, I well try finding something other to do. Nothing Good ever lasts anyway.   Thanks for reading.  UNO POWER.',
       'Classic UNO with a couple of modern twists and turns. I have never spent any real money in a game and I don\'t ever plan to, but here you also don\'t really need to. I\'ve won many tournaments and got really far in the game without buying anything. You get extra coins by winning and completing daily tasks, as well as watching ads. But you\'re not forced to watch them. It\'s not just about luck. You have to play smart to win, just like any other card game. I love it.',
       'Great game in the graphics department however, I agree with other consumers when they say the special abilities you can obtain by playing this game ruins it. Simple is best and this uno app is anything but. Sometimes when I log in, the tokens don\'t even recharge overnight and I have to wait a few more hours before I play three free rounds of uno before you have to pay for more tokens. Very hit and miss app.',
       'Okay, this is actually a decent game HOWEVER unless you buy your way through its almost impossible to win tournaments.  They shouldn\'t be putting people in the "club" and level 100+ with people who are like level 10 and not in this "club" it makes it almost impossible for them to win unless they\'re INSANELY lucky.  People with cheats can turn you from being at uno and winning, to being in last place in seconds and it honestly just kills the enjoyment of the game' ],

     [ 'I think there should be option of chatting with guild members and other players not voice chatting but message ones.  There should be some research option in every guild or either there should be some Commander talent points by which we can increase some of the tactics of team & player.  Main Idea :  I think there should be some event in which 2 guilds can fight with each other & there should be option of ally & others.  I know it\'s kinda different game but it will make fun to game.   Overall this game is best and addictive,  Thanks for making this game.  Great effort by dev team.  Love you.',
       'Hi,there my players name is cammanderDJR and I won death match like 3 times even though my level is 9 and I have no experience in survival games but this is like the best game I\'ve ever played. I still have a few idea\'s on how to make it better and that\'s the graphics please improve it. Love the game way better than Rules of Survival.',
       'This is a great game. My friends and I love it and it\'s probably the closest thing to PUBG that will ever be made. One thing though.. How do I add people to my guild. 😂😂😂  And considering improvements, maybe you could expand the map a bit, get it to 100 people on the map at a time but that\'s not exactly an issue, maybe something to work towards. Also, maybe add a chat room for guild members and not just the voice chat.',
       'The game is developing good so far. Hope you\'ll add a feature wherein we can make a game with our friends and play against each other. It would be cooler 👍   This is a shoutout to the 5th friend that we have to sacrifice when we go play on squad lol, thanks!',
       'This game is good fun but pls can u stop peoee from running u over as when 8 get in top 3 some keeps running me over. It\'s still and amazing games but when people run u over its boring and wish u could stop people from doing this   is th8nkthere u should maybe be able to drive places but when u want to fight they have to get out and shoot and have a proper gun fight . Overall this is a great game my favourite mobile game and it\'s really enjoyable. But pls can u make people not being able to do this. Thankyou',
       'I\'ve been facing a new issue. I always used to get a ping of around 140 - 180 ms with my Jio until day before yesterday. But, since then, I\'m always getting a ping of 300+ ms. This is really annoying. Close combats are pretty impossible. I\'ve checked everything. My network is fine. I get a better ping in other online games which I play. My friends have been facing this issue as well. So, it has become harder to play squad and duo matches as well. Please do something about this Garena. I would definitely drop a 5 star then.' ],

     [ 'I love the game. the game play itself is very self explanatory, quick and very good fps however, they have scammed me. I spent 12.99 on gbucks, the purchase was confirmed, and right after they asked me if i had liked to submit another card number for another purchase. I recall having credentials on a different prepaid visa card in my notes, so I go look, unfortunately I didn\'t have the CVS code for it. I go back to the game, it had reloaded but I didn\'t get my gbucks. I was a little confused as the purchase had been confirmed, and the money was taken off my card. I tried contacting them 3 separate times about it but obviously they aren\'t vigilant of their customers and don\'t take them as a priority. I recommend playing the game but avoid spending money on it. If I could get some help and get a refund on my card, or the gbucks I originally paid for, I will give it 5 stars, as I would like to.',
       'I love this game so much. I have been looking for a good shooting game for years and I never found one until I came across this. This is perfect. Me and my friend would spend hours on this game. I have been playing this for about 6 months now. It\'s perfect. I think the best thing about this game is how organized everything is. It is very self explanatory. I found everything and it was easy to do so. I also love how they update this game very often. Great game. I haven\'t had any problems with it. I can\'t wait for updates later on to come.',
       'Game is really tooo gud, graphics also nice n smooth controls but u guys released only one game mode(Team death match), but in lot of fps games they provided free for all, bomb mode, Flag capture n many more modes.. If u guys also provide  like that then ur game gonna be top in fps games 😀 n mainly  not much places only 3-4... try to add more places n increase the area Size for more fun n more Dodge , now game look like playing in a pocket u guys need to increase area.',
       'The best shooting game ever. Lobed each and every single thing about this game but there a little suggestion that we can see the player if they are online or not but how is this if we can see there live going on matches? That concept will be great and games lag sometimes so if you can fix this and add my suggestion in guns of boom that will be hell great!! #the best game',
       'I was loving it and have spent alot of money but this update made it to where i can\'t even open it back up. Please fix because i loved this game and have invested time and money and if i don\'t get to play it anymore sometime soon I\'m not coming today back. Please fix very soon i was trying earn a special gun but I\'m not sure if that\'ll be an option if an when it gets fixed',
       'Played this game on my old 6S and S7 edge without any problems. Now that I have a Pixel 2 XL, controls have a major glitch. Seems to go nuts on its own or sticks too one side of the screen. Happens every match, almost unplayable. Very disappointing!' ],

It\'s a humble request to the developers that there should be a feature of playing previously played levels.',

       'This would totally be worth 5 stars if it weren\'t for the ADS. I get it\'s a free game, but its one thing to put an ad on the top or side of the screen. It\'s one thing to optionally watch ads for coins and prizes. But its another thing when full screen videos pop-up, pausing your game and wasting your time. I was honestly thinking about giving this 3 stars just b/c of how annoying that is alone.',

     [ 'This game needs the ability to gain more township cash. I have spent way too much real money to buy township cash and im not doing so again at this rate. Farmville isnt this bad and hard to expand.  You cant expand the barn without waiting on products by train or paying in township cash to expand. And that costs over a couple hundred township cash for each expansion. Getting a dollar or two here and there takes forever to collect. Plus the expansion makes small expansions so it doesnt help much.   If something dont change i may quit the game. I enjoy it and would like to continue but at this rate i dont see much point. I cant afford to pay more money to play.',
       'The Best!  But not Great my suggestion is please add an option to chat your friends privately this is important!.  Also add an option to search anyone by their township name so we can easily adding them.. Last one add an option to change your profiles photo from our gallery if you can~ instead of using our Facebook photos or township original photos.. Please make it happen',
       'RSYFJH Great game very addictive, and I don\'t know if I just found the right Co-op or what but the team work on this game is amazing. I love my little town although, 😒 you need to be able to expand faster! I have NO ROOM for any more buildings, and they want me to expand my population so I can add more buildings. Thats\'s kind of ridiculous. That\'s the only bad thing I have to say about this game.',
       'BEST GAME EVER! It\'s my biggest game but even though I have an old phone the game still runs really smoothly. There\'s always something to do, it never gets boring. I\'ve been playing for 8 months. Super easy to use and learn. It\'s addictive. You also don\'t feel pressured to make purchases like other games.',
       'I love this game. Amazing sound effects, graphics. You guys did a great job that\'s for sure! But still couldn\'t give it a five star because of the lastest update. The entire screen goes black after playing the game for 5-6 minutes. That\'s pretty irritating not to mention how much slower the phone gets as well. Didn\'t have these issues with the last update. Fix it please!',
       'I think this game is really great and addictive, especially when you start playing tge regetta. I  love my coop members, they are a great team.  I just wish they would let us cancel orders in factories, because often you order stuff but then a train arrives and your priorities change...' ],

     [ 'Hello I\'ve been playing this game for months, so much so that I began to pay to play it. In October of 2017 I had a late payment that resulted in me loosing my VIP status. However; My bank account reflected withdrawals of 9.99 for game plays from October 2017 until January 2018. Google was able to give my money back for January but I have to now contact the Administration of this game in order to be reimbursed for previous months. I love playing this game but I will no longer pay to play anymore.  I will keep you all posted on my outcome.',
       'Decent amount of ads.  I sometimes have an issue where it suddenly stops accepting input. The game doesn\'t freeze, just can\'t do anything. I\'ve tried going to home screen and back and even turning my screen off and back on, nothing works.  Have to force close it. :(  this happens maybe 1 out of every 7 or 8 times I play.  Samsung note 8.   A "live" or else "play with a friend" type of feature would be cool.',
       'The game itself is very amazing in graphics and very creative. BUT as for the VIP membership, it\'s totally absurd that we have to pay $9.99 plus taxes monthly. I would be fine with it if it was $9.99 a year. Hope that this will change some day. I love playing this game. I play this EVERYDAY, even more than any other games. Please consider about changing the membership fee to yearly rather than monthly.',
       'the game does too many resets, all on its own. i can be in the middle of a game, and the game will stop in mid-stream, then start a new game, and causing me to lose not only what i have "won", but will set me all the way back to the bronze box, or, in the case of special games, such as the winter sports 2018, back to the red box, when i actually finished and won the silver medal. the game can be veeerrrrryyyy slooooooooow, and often is. i enjoy the show when i get a chance to watch it, but am not so sure about the game. it would also be nice if there were instructions on how to play the features that are *not* in the tv show...',
       'It\'s very addictive and a lot of fun to play.  There are way too many pop up ads as others have said.  I\'d like to see one change...in the real game a player can spin continuously until s/he doesn\'t get a letter or lands on an item where they lose their turn.  As it stands your turn is up after you spin or buy a vowel or vice versa.',
       'Extremely laggy, ads do not always close, and the game freezes or closes itself very often. It almost exclusively does that while in a game, so you automatically lose. The inbox always says there\'s 1 more message than there actually is. And sometimes hitting "play" closes the app instead of starting a game. Complete waste of time.' ],

Given a legendary atrandom at start a,nd a random rare in chest would be cool was expecting that..but no just normal cards.hope I get  cool legendary one day.like. the chest idea hope you bring in armour card add on.like spear guy could have ice spear or flames.plus that\'s cool extract cards to collect to make your cards even better and unique. Thank you my supercell friend.this game oh almost,st forgot.bbbbbbbeest 2 v 2 game on mobile,!!!!!',
       'I don\'t think I need to \'review\' much here. There are some points I definitely don\'t like about the game. Such as the matchmaking... You get matched with the same deck type in a row. Other than that and some minor flaws it\'s a great game. I love the competitive aspect about it.  Finally I would suggest some 2v2 with different game modes, such as ramp up 2v2. Also, add the rematch button in 2v2 challenges with random mates.  Hope I hit the 4,3k this season. Good luck to all clashers!',
       'I think Clash Royale is a great game to play and is very well put together for all ages, it is a fast paced game and at the same time can be played with an individual pace of your own to a degree being that there is a clock ticking, also new characters are released at a well balanced rate, so that the game doesn\'t become boring and the regular balance of the characters strengths and weaknesses are balanced to make the game more competitive. I recommend this game for all ages and abilities. It\'s great for a few minutes or an hour or so and this game also has several different tournaments you can enjoy yourself or with a friend or a teammate. See you soon on Clash Royale. A.K.A. Dad.',
       'Well after playing it for so many months. It now has not let me play for about a  week out of no where, it loads to 50% and then it asks to try again later I have uninstalled it many times and retried time after time. All of my other games work just not this one. Don\'t really know what to do. It sucks because this is my favorite game too.',
       'This is  the best game ever. And supercell, can u add google + sign in so that people who don\'t use facebook can also have friends.. Also I have like 8 leggie right now and I am so happy. And the new clan battle is awesome, it is the best. I wish it is permanent. Anyways clan battle is so fun to play and who ever created it.. U r awesome. Keep up the good work Supercell. Love you so much and ur games.😙😙😙❤❤❤❤😀😁😁😊😊😊',
       'Supercell, I think your best game is hay day. Clash royale on the other hand isn\'t one of your better games. Android is better than apple. Why would you ever support apple instead of android. You released Brawl Stars only for apple. You should have less medieval/fantasy games unless you make the knights, princes etc. More realistic. In my opinion I think you\'re better at making farm and army games. Please make more of those😖' ],

     [ 'Enjoyable game. Don\'t have to spend money on diamonds unless you\'re after a top look. Best played when linked to FB which means you can borrow from friends\' closets. Would rate 5 stars but recently I am having issues opening results in my in box. Every time I receive a result the page opens halfway then I have to exit the game and reload. Playing on an Asus ZenPad, anyone having the same issue or have a solution pls?',
       'I have been playing Covet for 4 yrs every single day! Being in the fashion industry I find it so interesting that the products you dress your models in are real items you can buy in real life. They have a great collection of brands but Im excited to see more.   And contrary to popular belief you dont have to spend a dime to play. My strategy for this is I play the daily challenge with either past seasonal clothes or i borrow from my fashion house. If your vision and outfit is great you will win the free item regardless of whether it is in season or not. By doing this you save $500 a day and i wait till a covet series comes along and play it till my heart and imagination is content.   Take it from a Covet junkie, you will be hooked for years!',

Everything is so expensive and what you get for diamonds in a day is very little. It was disappointing to say the least. I had a few friends who played and could borrow from their closets but none of them play anymore. Probably for the same reason I am about to stop playing myself.Give better incentives and give better prizes and maybe I will play again. Bummed out, the game has great potential',
       'Great pass time and fun to play. For a while I do nothing just for the daily diamonds but I don\'t mind because the game is just overall fun to play! Maybe it would be better ifyou earned more cash for entering style challenges but... STILL FUN😉',
       'In the beginning, I absolutely loved this game, but now, I do admit that it get\'s a bit boring and frustrating after a while because getting cash and diamonds without paying real money is incredibly difficult and time consuming. I do like that they fixed the reaction time for voting because it used to be sooo slow. But overall, I highly recommend this game for any kind of fashion lover who is willing to have the patience to play it.',
       'They really just want your money. Can\'t try on multiple things at the same time, Rewards are pathetic for the challenge requirements being so high, levelling up takes ages , definitely not beginner friendly. Pretty to look at gets boring really quickly and can\'t be moved to SD storage, overall it gets more frustrating as you realise you can\'t afford anything and can\'t enter challenges.' ],

     [ 'Excellent game, love playing it. There are a couple of things that I don\'t agree with in this game. If I have to finish in 1st place in order to move through every level in the career, why do I start every race in last position, this definitely has to change and I should be able to move through the whole career mode regardless of how I finish. Secondly, if I\'m using alot of game cash to pay for upgrades why do I have to use soooo many gold coins to make these upgrades instant. This should happen immediately after purchase Wether it\'s with coins or cash, NOT BOTH. Please make these changes and don\'t make it harder to play than it should be, thanks!',
       'Awesome game. Just sit back on the couch or lay in bed or play this lovely racing game at your job. Get money values and try to get 1st place! Show the compiteters/players who is REALLY boss on your phone or tablet. From tilt controls to steering, this very nice game otta be the #1 game on top #10 best car and or racing games. I GOT 9th PLACE ONCE BUT THEN 2nd THEN 1$t! Takes a lot of storage and downloads and service waiting,BUT STILL GOOOD GAME. YOU SHOULD DOWNLOAD (if you want and or have a lot of storage left,and you have no games installed.)',
       'What is the point for having money??? Money does you know good. In the earlier part of the game you used to be able to purchase vehicles. Need to bring that back. Having 10 million dollars does me know good, if I can\'t spend it.....  Still need vinyls for wheels, so you can have multiple colors. Need more wheels and also where are the Subaru\'s??? Also, I dont see the point in purchasing a car just for 1000 gold to only be able to use it for 1 or 2 races?????   The game is good in the early parts, but becomes redundant after a couple of years.',
       'Loving this game. Been playing a long time. Probably the best online game ever ,if you love to race. A little something for all race fans. To team play and game mode. Rr3 is awesome. But for the first time ever I had an issue and can\'t get ahold of support. To me that is a big negative. I will remove this if it gets addressed. Thank u. King James Racing',
       'Don\'t wanna be a hater, so ill keep it real. Its an awesome game. Great Graphics, GREAT SOUND, Great Game. My issues...THE GAME COSTS TOO MUCH TO PLAY. You can\'t earn that much, but it costs soooo much. Smh. Also would be nice if u guys added manual gear changes and slider throttle so u can have better accelerator control. Other then the high cost, this game is an absolute must have for any fan of true racing simulators. No game on the market is better, (except those with manual transmissions:)',
       'First of all there seems to be a glitch with the sound. It doesn\'t alwaus play correctly and I get this wierd digital echoing sound. If I reboot my phone it works o.k. for a while, until I stop and restart the game. Then the sound is digitized reverb again.    I don\'t play a lot of car racing games but because this one is made by EA I figured I would give it a try. Love it. Hard to get the cars I want but I guess EA has to make money somehow.  Great game. EA delivers the best in car racing.    Loaded onto Samsung, Galaxy, Note 8.' ],

     [ 'So I played it on my iPhone e and loved it. Recently o got a new phone and it\'s am android. I connected to my Nintendo account and loaded it up. My world seem to be it good shape everything there like in my IPhone but when I went to tour only world one was available. I\'m not going to spend another ten dollars to unlock what I already beat so please fix it I wanna keep enjoying this gamr',
       'Love this game and love the nostalgia but there is no way I\'m paying £9.99 to level up on any game ever let alone one where a single tap on the screen is the only player interaction. Even with direction control etc like the old days wouldn\'t make it worth the price being asked.',
       'I have had a very long conversation with someone at the hq and I was talking about the worlds. I bought the worlds on my iPad and downloaded Mario run on this device Android. I ask why my worlds that I purchased on my iPad aren\'t here. They don\'t connect that purchase with Nintendo account. When they connect everything else. I told them I am not paying twice so that brings down the rating for me for this game. But great fun and very enjoyable, but get the linking fixed. Seems a bit of a design flaw',
       'This would have got 5 stars had I been able to share it with my 2 kids via family share. I refuse to pay £30 for all 3 of us to have access to all the levels.  Great game though. Fun, quick and easy to play. Many hours spent between us. So many levels too.',
       'Super Mario run is a great smartphone game it has the very addicting toad rally and remix ten and the simple, but very rewarding controls. The kingdom builder is a good addition but is kinda unnecessary. The only big problem I have with it is that it has to always be online. I give super Mario run 8.5/10 stars',
       'I beat world 1, and I have to pay for the rest of the game? Really? This is stupid.. If you\'re going to have a game you need to pay for, market it as such, not the ol bait and switch. Very deceitful.. At least make a trial game or demo game not lure someone in and then tell them they need to pay to finish the game' ],

     [ 'It\'s nice game - very nice graphic, very smooth moving - it would be 5 stars. BUT - I payed for levels 13 and 14 , and the game does not allow me to play in random order - it\'s not possible to play no. 23 without finishing all numbers before. If you are stuck in some number, you cannot go to another one - you MUST BUY hint!!! It means - you PAID for the game, but you MUST PAY again for hint - or you are blocked in PAID  game. It\'s just not fair.',
       'A lot of Numberlink programs have "fake" puzzles - they have multiple solutions unless additional non-standard "rules" are followed... which are NEVER fun. This app doesn\'t do that. These are the real deal, and are VERY satisfying to solve. The price is extremely low for the quantity and quality on offer; I highly recommend this game.',
       'I have now completed a 365 day streak... During this past year of playing this game daily, I\'ve had an idea. What if once you hit a certain amount of streak days you unlock a new something? Like a new pack or flow color? That would be nice so that you are working towards something. :)',
       'I loved flow free from a young age. I\'ve played until 9×9 pack but when I reached a certain level,  the game stopped working after that and I\'ve tried over and over again to go in but the game just keeps bring me back to the home screen and keeps stopping. Please fix it. I really want to play the remaining levels and packs',
       'Great game. Keep coming back to it. I find it relaxing solving the puzzles, though it has become super easy! All versions are great. All in all, awesome job! One of my favourites, and works in any situation. Quick break at work, something productive ? Play. Something to do before sleep? Play. Got a few extra mins? Play! Wanna challenge yourself on timed? Play! Haha.',
       'Fantastic game. Real addiction game I\'d say. It\'s an awesome time killer. Different types of levels never make the game boring. Graphics is okay. Number of ads for a free to play game is less compared to other games out in the market which is a relief.Overall I would give 4.5/5' ],

     [ 'This is a good game and is addictive when you are bored but I wish it didn\'t take long for you to get tickets to read a story and needs more sound effects but overall this is a very neat game😊😊😊😊',
       'A lot of the male characters don\'t show up when I\'m playing. The dialogue and speech box will still be there but I can\'t see any of the male characters, and this only happens with the male characters. I have tried all that I can to make it work, but it won\'t and I have to go through the stories without them being there most of the time. Please fix this for me and I will change my rating, and please allow to create a story in Limelight for mobile, I really wanna make my story but all I have is my phone and I LOVE the Limelight versions.',
       'I never EVER been so absolutely in love with a app. I only read about 3 stories and spent $82 for gems and tickets because not only I couldn\'t resist it\'s the least I could do for the creaters for creating such a perfect game that seriously was meant for me in every way possible! (And I NEVER spent money on ANY apps so THAT is how much I LOVE this!) This brings me endless amounts of happiness! It\'s EVERYTHING a story lover could love! 😍💓 AND THERE IS NO ISSUE AT ALL ABSOLUTELY NONE! And I am so not lying when I say NO ISSUE! 😁 100/10 game! My only wish is I\'d love for another way to earn gems.',
       'Game is fun. Dont even mind spending money in gens every now and again. But seriously to get the outcome you want, this app is charging waaaaaaay too many gems. Like 50 for one simple choice. And its goes up higher depending on the amount of gems you have. If I pay $5.99 for like 60 gems.. that should get me through and entire story. Not just one chapter. Will delete app if they dont change it. Not gonna spend $40 to finish a story.. Sorry but I think thats outrageous.',
       'This game is really fun! I wish there was a way to restart a story that you are in the middle of or that you could change your appearance or other people\'s appearence at any time. Also when you decide what your character is wearing, sometimes you can\'t see it because dialog is in the way. Also when you choose what you look like. I would prefer it to be against a white background. It\'s hard to see what the darker colors look like.',
       'I love this app so much. I love all of the stories ive read  and am reading. The only problem is that although they\'ve added more chances of earning gems they Only give us 2 passes now every 4 hrs. That way to much time to wait for only two passes. Before the update they gave 4 passes every 4 hrs. I think that was better coz u got mire passes with that amount of time  11' ],

       'Great game. The games are more fun than Candy crush and much more fair. For example, they let you make moves you can\'t play in Candy crush and timed rounds don\'t start until you touch the screen. Also, while some of the games are really challenging, you don\'t get stuck on them for days and days.  There are no gems or gold bars, etc. You don\'t have to slowly earn some kind of premium currency or pay real money to get special prizes.',
       'This is my favorite game. Absolutely love playing it whenever I can. However, why did the the flower growing from beating levels suddenly switch from starting on Friday, so we can enjoy it over the weekend to starting during the beginning of the week. Did not get to use my 6 hours of unlimited lives like I have been since this started. I would very much like if it could be switched back to the original timeline. Enjoy unlimited lives and contests over the weekend when it\'s more likely more users will have the time.',
       'I think that we should get more  coins for winning the levels. I find that the game can cost me money that I don\'t have, so I will spend less time playing your game. I love this game alot but why play if you are not getting enjoyment because it costs to much to play. (Otherwise I love the game) I also never got my horse, please give me my horse, I really need that horse btw. I already had a name for her to. I was going to call her daisy. The name goes great with the garden theme. (If you hadnt realized thst already) Please please send me daisy, I love her already. Peace.',
       'Playrix games are all generally the same.. They\'re good. But well designed to ensure and encourage the use of real money to play. Think of old arcade machine style of game mechanics and you\'ve got a general idea of what you can expect from any of their titles.  The only thing truely different is how quickly each game decides it wants to dig for your wallet.  Disappointing.',
       'It was a lot of fun the first few "days" but got very hard very fast. Don\'t bother with power-ups as it doesn\'t really make a difference. The only way to win is to get lucky with a big bomb. That\'s it. It\'s a shame because the game is nice, I just progress way too slowly now for it to be worth playing.' ],
